      "title": "A Girl with a Plan!: Reimagining Contraceptive Services with Adolescent Girls in  Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania unlocks hope... and rapid contraceptive uptake",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Global evidence points to the importance of increased emphasis on reaching adolescents to advance sexual and reproductive health (SRH) globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, 7.7 million adolescent girls aged 15-19 have an unmet need for modern contraception. Meeting girls’ contraceptive needs would prevent an estimated 1.1 million unintended pregnancies and related preventable maternal mortalities and morbidities. Today, global investments in adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health (AYSRH) have spent millions and yielded promising interventions that generally require high dosage (multiple sessions and exposures) to achieve contraceptive uptake (e.g. PSI Liberia’s Life Skill program or Pathfinder’s PRACHAR program). The global health community is keen to determine even more effective and efficient ways to generate demand for and delivery of contraceptive services to young people. While many public health practitioners recognize that engaging young people in intervention design and decision-making is important, few programs do this meaningfully and systematically. In Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania, the Adolescents 360 (A360) project turned the traditional model of academic program design inside-out, putting youth voices, real world-reaction, and real-world interaction at the centre of research and activity design. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>A360 hypothesized that reimagining contraceptive services together with girls, using an iterative transdiciplinary approach which complemented a human-centered design process with expertise from the disciplines of public health, social marketing, developmental science and socio-cultural anthropology, would lead to contraceptive programs that achieve higher rates of contraceptive uptake and adoption than traditional youth-focused programs. Application of this approach demonstrated that when girls see contraception as relevant to their lives, aligned with their aspirations of motherhood, and supportive of their near term emotional needs, and when  youth-friendly services are offered immediately in a way that eliminates stigma, AYSRH programs can achieve rapid, breakthrough results.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A360’s research activities in Ethiopia and Nigeria and discovery activities in Tanzania revealed that adolescent girls see contraceptives as irrelevant, harmful, and at odds with their identity and dreams of motherhood. This insight delivered a programmatic blueprint to reframe contraceptive services for adolescents. Traditionally, programs position contraception as a medical intervention used once one is sexually active to prevent pregnancy and safeguard health and long-term educational and financial aspirations that may be practically out of reach. In contrast, A360 uses empowering branding and communications throughout every element of the program to positions contraceptives in a way that is developmentally optimized to support girls’ affective decision-making, wherever they may be on their developmental trajectory. Building on developmental science foundations (including neurobiology), A360’s activities link contraceptive use to girls’ immediate goals and emerging desire to gain financial strength, systematically reassure about fertility, and simultaneously offer friction-free, youth-friendly counselling services at point of contact whenever possible. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Program field-testing began in approximately six service delivery points in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania in mid-June 2017. By January 2018, A360 expanded to a cumulative 88 service delivery points and resulted in 11,630 girls aged 15-19 receiving relevant SRH information and the opportunity for an opt-out counselling moment with a provider. 4,813 of these girls took up a modern contraceptive method: 444 married out of school girls in rural Ethiopia, and 1,080 in and out of school girls in Nigeria, and 3,289 in and out of school girls in Tanzania.  Early results indicate that, of adolescent girls reached by A360 interventions who are not currently using a contraceptive, and are not pregnant, 78%, 28%, and 79% of girls in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania respectively received a modern contraceptive method through A360 service delivery through a single contact. Amongst adopters of a contraceptive method, the overall mix is as follows: 9% IUDs, 46% Implants, 14% injectables, 10% oral contraceptive pills, 4% emergency contraceptives, and 17% condoms-only. 55% of contraceptive adopters chose a long-acting reversible method. As the project works in countries where a preference for injectables has been noted, these findings suggest strong success in effective counseling. In addition, A360 is achieving these promising results through a single contact with girls, suggesting the blueprint described above, executed in a way that is adapted to local context, can catalyze rapid behavior change, which is more cost effective to implement than more intensive interventions requiring multiple exposure to yield contraceptive uptake.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<ul>\t<li>Empowering young people to play a leading role in research activities and program design through a structured human centered design process informed by other key public health, adolescent developmental science, social marketing, and anthropological disciplines, can lead to effective contraceptive programs that achieve high adoption rates, rapid service uptake, and strong method mix. </li>\t<li>When familiar evidence-based practices like youth-friendly service delivery, on-site services, and community-based outreach are designed around a resonant and relevant narrative and are executed to delight girls and reinforce one another in an empathetic way, activities that look familiar at first glance can achieve dramatically different results. </li>\t<li>Empowering and exciting brands developed with girls can tie together activities, build trust and credibility of services, and make girls feel like they belong to a supportive and inspiring movement to live life on her own terms.</li>\t<li>Reframing contraceptives as the first step to achieving a near term goal—whether or not a girl identifies as sexually active—and contextualizing the discussion of contraception as the first step to achieving that immediate goal, increases girls’ motivation to take up a method.</li>\t<li>Positioning contraceptives as aligned with these emotionally immediate goals—including motherhood, which girls aspire to—also allows providers to address pervasive concerns about infertility and other myths about contraceptive use. </li></ul><p>Next Steps: Through 2020 the project will continue to optimize and expand activities in the three countries using adaptive implementation and working closely with local governments on sustainable models for long-term impact. </p>",

      "title": "Combining structural and reproductive health to improve transition to adulthood: The Musanze Youth Center model",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Evidence suggests that integration of healthcare services can improve patient health outcomes by addressing several needs at once and eliminating inefficiencies of vertical health structures. Integration has had promising results, which has led to a focus on youth SRH service integration. After a successful model for family planning (FP) Integration in two districts in Rwanda, one major finding was that even though each facility has a youth corner, data shows very poor utilization of services by youth. A meeting with key youth groups leaders in Musanze to discuss these results revealed reasons why youth did not want to attend youth corners in health facilities. They stated their preference for receiving sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education and services in places where they would already visit for reasons outside of healthcare, including just to “hang out”. This information was then discussed with the mayor of the city of Musanze, who decided to provide support for revitalization of the youth center. The city provided the infrastructure, data management, and security. They also intentionally moved the Youth Employment Agency to the same facility as the Musanze Youth Center (MYC) and provided the health providers, as well as medical supplies and materials.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The MYC program was designed to provide on-site counseling, testing, treatment, and referrals for various SRH-related services. These include HIV and STIs, FP and pregnancy, gender-based violence, and legal abortion and post-abortion care. In addition, the center offers health counseling and education sessions, as well as skills building for single mothers. There are also recreational activities (games, entertainment) and free internet for professional development and personal use. We hypothesized that this system of service provision would attract greater numbers of youth over time and ultimately increase utilization of SRH services in the district.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The UC Berkeley Bixby Center collaborated with the Musanze Vice Mayor for Social Affairs and the Rwanda Biomedical Research Center to establish a youth-led youth center that opened in June 2017 in the Musanze district of Rwanda. The MYC was initially developed with youth participation to address poor SRH service utilization at youth corners in health facilities. The integration component of the MYC allows adolescents and young adults (ages 10-30) to have access to any of the offered activities in one location, even if visitors arrived for a different type of service. MYC activities are co-designed and managed by 25 youth leaders and new activities are regularly added to the MYC offerings to satisfy diverse interests and needs of youth. However, all programming is conducted with long-term sustainability and scalability in mind, as this is a low-cost program utilizing existing infrastructure and the creativity of young people.  </p><p>We collected data on youth visiting the MYC each month from June 2017 through February 2018. Participants complete an intake form at each visit as part of ongoing monitoring and evaluation, which provides information on age, gender, and reason for visit. Further evaluation plans are underway, including documentation of youth engagement.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Between June 2017 and February 2018, 33,464 youth visited the MYC. About 20% (6,728) of these visits were first time visits, with the rest counted as repeat visitors.</p><p>In the first month, the MYC received 1,012 youth visitors; in the sixth month, there were 6,532 youth visitors. There was a decrease in the number of monthly visitors between November 2017 and February 2018, with the latest month having received 4,521 visitors. There were consistently more male than female visitors attending each month. Between June 2017 and February 2018, 34% of MYC visitors came to use ICT services and 35% came for games and entertainment. Many visitors utilized multiple services; even though most visitors reported initially coming to the MYC for recreational purposes, 14,580 visitors attended an SRH education session and 3,391 having received health services. The most common SRH service was HIV services, with 3,230 youth receiving counseling and 93% of them (3,001) receiving testing and/or further investigation and follow-up.  While 1,052 youth received family planning counseling, only 36 received a contraceptive method other than condoms, for which data were not recorded.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This program generates critical information on effective strategies for adolescents and how youth centers can be sustainably revitalized. We expect that the cohorts passing through the program will have better job opportunities and will have significantly less STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. The rapid increase in attendance by youth, particularly young men, indicates that youth in the Musanze district feel comfortable going to and utilizing services offered by the MYC. Offering integrated services proved successful in particular for SRH education services. While only about 3,300 visitors came to the MYC for SRH education, 14,580 people attended at least one SRH education session. These figures demonstrate that offering a more comprehensive range of activities, including recreational ones, can encourage young individuals to take advantage of health services to which they may not have otherwise been exposed. More important, the success of MYC speaks to the importance of engaging youth in design and implementation. The inspiration for the MYC came from a meeting with key youth leaders in Musanze to discuss why youth did not want to attend youth corners in health facilities and how/where they would prefer to receive services.</p><p>Next steps include: 1) creating programs and activities to encourage more young women and girls to attend; 2) continuing to train providers in FP counseling and provision to increase FP uptake among youth in the region; and 3) tailor both recreational and SRH activities and services to meet the specific needs of the visitors and provide outreach services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Many young girls migrate down south from the Northern parts of Ghana to settle in densely populated places. They become Head Porters (‘Kayayei’) to earn an income to support their families back home or to save money for various reasons. While majority of Kayayei are school drop outs, others have escaped from out-moded socio-cultural practices such as forced marriages and female genital mutilation. These young girls, on arrival in cities, sleep at lorry stations, market sheds and other open spaces which exposes them to human and environmental dangers such as harassment, sexual abuse, extortion and other barriers which prevent them from realizing their human rights. These young girls are vulnerable and experience high rates of STIs and unplanned pregnancies than their peers and in addition lack access to and use of quality health services and lifesaving commodities. Government and other agencies have initiated various interventions to assist these young girls. These include policies and strategies for improving Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR),enrolment onto the National Health Insurance System(NHIS), and provision of skills training. Despite some progress made over the years, these girls still face a number of health challenges and several gaps remain in ensuring they attain the</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In response, HealthKeepers Network together with its partners and with funding and technical support from USAID initiated <em>Kayayei HealthKeepers Program (KHP)</em> to promote their health and wellbeing. It is also to empower the young girls with tools to make informed decisions, improve their economic status and help drive progress towards reaching SDG’s 3, 4 and 5. Two hundred Kayayei from selected communities within the Greater Accra Region are benefiting directly from the project interventions which includes; training of these young girls to provide SRH education and services including family planning, capacity building in life skills and micro-business management.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The girls were met in person and the program was explained to them. Those who expressed interest and met the selection criteria were recruited. Prior to the recruitments, HKN held series of advocacy meetings with opinion leaders and influencers of the Kayayei communities to introduce the program to them to obtain their support. Meetings were held with district health directorates to forge partnership and establish referral links.  </p><p>The Kayayei went through a 2-day start-up training on topics such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health, STIs and family planning. Group work and role plays were used to ensure proper understanding of the topics. Pre and post-tests were conducted to determine level of knowledge transfer.</p><p>On completion of the training, the Kayayei were provided with branding collaterals including baskets containing oral contraceptives pills, condoms and personal care items such as soaps, disinfectants, toothpaste and sanitary pads to begin a social micro-business in health to generate income for their upkeep. These personal care items serve as ‘door openers’ to attract more customers, increase profits and contribute to their business sustainability. Monitoring and support visits are made fortnightly. During such visits, topics taught previously are refreshed and/or new topics are discussed with them.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Currently, 42 Kayayei have been trained. Analyses of pre and post tests indicated an increase in knowledge of family planning. Information gathered from one-on-one interviews with some Kayayei revealed that they have been empowered with knowledge, skills, self-worth and confidence, and an extra income.  </p><p>Before the commencement of the Kayayei HealthKeepers Program (KHP), most of the girls were earning averagely 20 cedis a day. With the add-on of KHP, some of them make additional income of 10-25 cedis a month. This means, Kayayei who are part of this program will have extra income to fall on, to support or replace their tedious head porter work. Asking what this extra money will be used for, Lamisi responded; <em>“I want to save this money to enable me go back to school”</em>.</p><p>Amina Amidu said <em>“When people stop whatever they do to listen to me, it serves as a source of motivation and makes me want to do the work more”</em>. Two other Kayayei, who were part of the program, shortly after the training arranged to resit some papers they failed in the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations (WASSCE). They indicated that although they had plans of going back to school, the HKN training activities boosted their confidence and made them realize they still had the potential of returning to school.  </p><p>The KHP, though nascent, is making positive impact on the health and wellbeing of the Kayayei and people in their immediate and extended communities. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<ul>\t<li>Forging and maintaining right partnerships in the Kayayei communities is key to success and sustainability. The leaders of the Kayayei communities have a lot of influence on the young girls. Involving them in all activities from the start creates trust, ownership and support to ensure active participation from the girls. Also involving their leaders help to reduce some of the stigma associated with talking about family planning.</li>\t<li>Regular monitoring and supportive supervision visits to Kayayei helps to identify and resolve challenges in a timely manner, which is key to quality assurance. Most Kayayei do not have permanent locations and usually move to where they can get work. The leaders being in the communities with the girls ensure that those who relocate can be traced during monitoring visits. In addition, on-site trainings in new topics are provided during these visits to sustain their interest in the program.</li>\t<li>Working with Kayayei requires tact. Due to their vulnerability, they have been exploited over time and thus it is difficult to win their trust. Constantly keeping in touch, encouraging and motivating them help them to build their confidence and increase their self-worth.</li>\t<li>Most Kayayei sleep in the open and in front of shops, thus do not have proper places for the storage of their products from damages and theft. Thus, storage condition is a criterion for recruitment.  Some Kayayei store their products with their leaders, in nearby clinics and drug stores, and with friends who live in better structures.</li></ul><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>After two decades of civil conflict in Northern Uganda, Ugandans have returned to their communities to reestablish their livelihoods. Uganda has the highest youth unemployment rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with youth making 80% of the unemployed. Seventy percent of Ugandan youth live on less than $2 a day and 30% access secondary education. Girls are more likely than boys to drop out of school. Youth in Northern Uganda have been referred to as the “lost generation,” and seen as a threat to the region’s sustained peace and security.</p><p>Youth Empowerment Through Agriculture (YETA) project seeks to help Youth<strong><em> in Northern Uganda to develop sustainable commercial enterprises</em></strong><strong><em>. </em></strong>YETA’s four objectives—1) Youth Associations (YAs) are formed and strengthened; 2) YA members have improved well-being and confidence through enhanced foundational skills; 3) YA members have access to increased financial services; and 4) YA members develop the technical and entrepreneurial skills to launch their businesses.</p><p>YETA targets youth between the age of 15 to 24 in the four districts of<strong><em> Masindi, Dokolo, Kole and Kiryandongo</em></strong><em>.</em> It is implemented by a consortium of three partners; NCBA CLUSA. Reproductive Health Uganda (RHU) and Youth Alive.   RHU provides sexual reproductive health information and services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>YETA model integrates Foundational skills (life skills, reproductive health) to prepare youth to deal with the personal and professional challenges they will face as empowered adults maintaining sustainable livelihoods. The Learn, Engage, Build model is used which creates a sustainable system for long-term support as youth manage their businesses.   Youth are trained in concepts they can relate to their everyday life (Learn), mentored to apply these concepts in a controlled setting (Engage), and supported to try out concept (Build). It takes youth 12 months to move from mobilization into a Youth Association, engagement in training and mentoring, to business start-up,</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Reproductive Health Uganda has trained peer leaders within the different Youth Associations, as well as all Youth Association members in basic SRHR packages. RHU has also mapped out public and private health centers that are providing SRH services within the target communities, built capacity of service providers in these facilities to provide Youth Friendly Services as well as support the health facilities to conduct SRHR outreaches within these communities especially at specific events such as the sports galas organized by Youth Alive Uganda (partner). District based trainers and peer educators have continued to disseminate key SRHR information, as well as refer YA members to health facilities to receive required SRHR services, as well as provide condoms within communities.</p><p>RHU also follows up public facilities to ensure that they continuously improve the delivery of health services to make them Youth Friendly as well as record and report all referrals of Young people accessing SRHR services.</p><p>Health service providers working with RHU periodically visit Youth Associations to conduct health talks and to encourage Young people to take up SRHR services.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 9,048 males and 6530 females have received training in financial literacy, 10057 young people have started up their own business. A total of 1294 have been trained as peer educators (50% female: 50%male) from the overall total of Youth Association members mobilized, while 21,214 have received training in foundational skills overall.  Eleven thousand seven hundred and sixty three (11763) young people have been referred and accessed SRHR services from public health facilities. And over 7 Million condoms have been distributed among the Youth host communities.</p><p>There has been a general increase in the number of Young people that go to receive SRHR services within health facilities.</p><p>There is reported decline in the time spent on gambling, crime and other illicit behavior within the target communities. <em>“ the number of Young people being detained at police stations over reckless crimes such as theft and gambling has greatly reduced in Masindi area, the Youth are busy and making our work easier.” Police chief, Masindi district)</em></p><p>A visit to Diima (kiryandongo) and Kwela (Dokolo)  health facilities showed severe decline in the overall number of young people testing positive with STIs especially Syphilis. The health workers attributed this to the many opportunities they have had to offer more time to talk to Young people in their Youth Associations, as well as the increased availability and supply of condoms in these groups.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Referrals done by peer educators generally reduced after the YA members got knowledgeable of how to navigate the health system and got familiar with the health workers especially those that visited their Youth Associations. However the general uptake of services by YA members and their spouses generally increased.</p><p>The deliberate decision to use family planning services were more integral in the lives of project beneficiaries. Many reasoned that many children and not well spaced will reduce their work time and thus compromise growth of their businesses. “when I get another pregnancy now, it will be hard for me to go at 4:00am to the landing site to pick fish for the market, and my business will collapse and I can’t pay the loan, so I will wait for 3-5 years before I add another child” YA member, kangai sub county).</p><p>Many young people who have begun productive ventures also took up a decision to go back for adult education classes within their communities as a means to increase their own empowerment and be meaningfully actors in the socio-political/economic undertakings in their localities.</p><p>Community perception of Young people’s programmes has greatly improved due to the visible progress with some of the group members whose lives seem on a positive path, but also young people engage in social enterprises that add to the community good such as cleaning water wells, manual paving of roads among others.</p>",

      "title": "Many pathways to youth freedoms: Making social entrepreneurship work for Youth SRH through the 'Adepa Project', Ghana",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Adepa Project (‘adepa’ literally ‘good cause’) is initiated by the Local Development Agency on Reproductive and Maternal Health (LODARMAH) – a member of the WHO’s Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH). The Adepa Project is conceived as a social entrepreneurship innovation for improving youth-oriented service delivery that makes for improvements in safe, sound, affordable and stigma-free menstrual hygiene.  It is significant in its ability to show that social entrepreneurship has the potential to provide acceptable community-based responses and partnerships in offering cost effective, accessible and affordable services, commodities and interventions in youth SRH. The project responds to proven-evident need of girls/women for services, commodities and information in hygienic menstruation in the Tano North Municipality. It draws upon novel and participatory project activities incorporating insights in social entrepreneurship, communication for development, social behavioral change communications, multi-stakeholder engagement processes and participatory as well as equity-focused evaluations.</p><p>The Adepa Project is important in showing how to mobilize multiple stakeholders and actors at diverse levels to appreciate their strategic benefits and synergies in support of identified and evidence-based youth sexual reproductive health interventions.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Adepa Project intervenes at three interrelated levels of improving youth’s access to safe and cost effective SRH commodities and services. First by building broad-based institutional support and partnerships needed to generate synergies and legitimize project interventions in ways that deal with foreseeable resistance and risks. Second, Adepa adopts social entrepreneurship approaches to design sustainable financing mechanism for providing girls with access to sanitary pads for managing menstruation. Lastly, Adepa intervenes at the individual and community levels by using social behaviorial change communication strategies including entertainment-education and sporting events to generate visibility of and support for project.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Adepa Project methodology combines innovations in social entrepreneurship, communication for development (specifically the visual problem appraisal tool), social behavioral change communication, multi-stakeholder engagement processes and participatory/equity-focused evaluations to deliver specifically proposed SRH interventions in the project contexts. The project was piloted in the Duayaw Nkwanta community of the Tano North district in 2013. About five communities and five thousand participants/beneficiaries in the Tano North Municipality will be directly impacted by the project. The primary beneficiaries are girls and women (aged 10 – 20 years); the secondary beneficiaries are youths (in-school and out-of-school youths) and the tertiary beneficiaries are populations within their active sexual reproductive health years including parents/guardians of youths. Duration: The project is projected to last for three years (2018 – 2021) with exit strategies including the setting up of a youth SRH Clinic, the production of customized sanitary pad made cost-effective for underprivileged girls. Data for the project derives from school-based sexual reproductive health surveys in the participant communities and ethnographic evidence. <strong>Evaluation approach: </strong>The project adopts participatory and equity-focused evaluation approaches to assess impact and extent of effectiveness of planned activities in delivering intended outcomes, outputs and impact.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary findings from the pilot indicate that social entrepreneurship approaches can result in significant community partnerships and financing mechanisms for menstrual hygiene interventions including the provision of affordable and safe sanitary pads for girls.</p><p>The adepa initiative has gained diverse community stakeholders’ support for the project (through the multi-stakeholder engagement processes embedded in the project) which has significant implications on addressing communities’ sensitivities, acceptance and participation in the project.</p><p>The project is expected to raise 60, 000 Ghana cedis (out of projected 1.5 million Ghana cedis in three years) from community partners as seed capital for the funding of the social enterprise initiative aimed at purchasing and supplying of sanitary pads to girls – both in school and out of school in sustainable ways.</p><p>The project has recruited and trained 30 volunteers and community ambassadors to help generate awareness, support and implement planned activities within communities.</p><p>The Adepa project has raised significant awareness about SDG 5 and menstrual hygiene issues within the Tano North Municipality and helped key development actors (including the Municipal Health Directorate, Traditional Council, Religious organizations and NGOs) to prioritize youth sexual reproductive health as an urgent development issue in the Tano North Municipality.</p><p>The Adepa Project has also improved knowledge on the relationships between menstrual hygiene and other areas of community development such as girls' education, girl-child empowerment, healthy families and generally healthy community workforce.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The program in its earliest stage brings lessons of local level financing strategies for improving youth sexual reproductive health. In the interim, it highlights the important role of social entrepreneurship and multi-stakeholder engagement processes for securing needed SRH partnerships and financing of interventions.</p><p>The project also has implications on strategies for integrating youth sexual reproductive health into local governance and development policy processes.</p><p>The Adepa Project also significantly brings out the lesson that the use of social behavioral change communication approaches leveraging social and traditional media can deliver project results when planned and embedded in communities’ shared values around sexuality. SBCC approaches fashioned in this framework can work to secure needed legitimacies and broad-based support needed for projects to succeed particularly in communities where open discussions around youth sexuality is either tabooed or considered sensitive. </p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Adolescents and youth face many barriers to accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services. These barriers include at structural, sociocultural and individual levels (SCI_Baseline and Barrier perspective study, 2015). Limited access to SRH services by the youth lead to teenage pregnancies, STI and HIV infections and other related SRH challenges hence contribute to increased maternal and newborn mortality. Fortunately, use of SRH services can contribute to a reduction in morbidity and mortality related to SRH including pregnancy and complications of childbirth and reduced HIV infections. Youth-friendly Health Services (YFHS) have been shown to reduce the barriers and historically, programs have sought to create a separate space for young people, a youth corner or center, but this approach has been found to be costly and it may not meet the needs of young people (Journal of Adolescent Health 56 (2015) S22eS41). Adolescents and youth represent a diverse population where the needs of a 16 year old in school adolescent girl are quite different from the needs of a 17 year old married and newly parenting girl. Both age and life stage should be considered when designing or selecting intervention models. One service delivery model is insufficient to reach all.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Under the European Commission funded Comprehensive Sexuality Education and Family Planning for Protection and Empowerment of Adolescents and Women in Malawi (ECSRH) Project, several service delivery models, using dedicated outreach teams (DOTs) are employed to reach adolescents and youth.  Two DOTs cover five project districts and offer a full range of methods, including long acting reversible contraception. DOTs are co-located at monthly MOH immunization clinics, standalone, and co-located at Open Days, community based events that include speeches, debates, songs, poems, quizzes, traditional dancing, and recreational activities. Adolescents are youth are targeted, however services are available for all age groups.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Project is implementing out of facility dedicated outreach clinics in five districts. A secondary review of service data was conducted from August-October, 2017 for comparative analysis of the three approaches used to reach adolescents and youths. This period represents the period when services are accessed most frequently as people don’t have agricultural responsibilities and is a market season where services are more easily accessed. The project’s target beneficiaries are adolescents and youth aged 10 – 24 years. The comparative analysis was done to determine which type of adolescents and youth are reached through each approach with regard to the following parameters; age, marital status and parity. The parameters were further subdivided into these groups; age; 10-14, 15 -19 and 20-24, marital status; unmarried versus married and parity; nulliparous, para 1 and para 2-3. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A review of the project database highlights the different type of adolescents and youth who utilize the different service delivery models, highlighting the importance of utilizing several service delivery models to reach youth.</p><p></p><p>While standalone DOT had lower numbers of adolescents and youths served overall, interestingly, 100% of the people who accessed contraceptives at this model were adolescents and youth, and had one child, of whom 80% were unmarried. Twenty percent were aged 15-19 and 80% 20-24 whilst there was none aged 10 -14.</p><p></p><p>DOT combined with Open Days highlighted that 62% of people served were adolescents and youth. This model served the highest number of nulliparous youth, with 14% of youth accessing services being nulliparous. Thirty-six percent of youth accessing services at open days were para 1 and 57% were para 2-3 of which 29% of all were unmarred. Eight percent were adolescents aged 10 -14, 92% were aged 15-24 .</p><p></p><p>At DOT co-located at immunization outreach clinics, 45% of those accessing contraceptives were adolescents and youth of which 6% were nulliparous adolescents and youth, 47% had one child and 47% had 2- 3 children. With regard to age, 100 of the youth were aged 15 -24 and there was none within the age range of 10 -14.  Eighty percent of the adolescents and youth reached were married.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Use of multi models is more effective to reach youth of varying characteristics in terms of age, marital status and parity. A combination of open days with DOT, for instance, is reaching out to wide range of youth including nulliparous adolescents and youth. The nulliparous youth find this model most convenient as they cannot be easily traced when they are accessing contraceptives since the open days have a lot of different activities happening hence the nulliparous youth are shielded in the crowd. This therefore means that if the project is intended for nulliparous youth then, the combination of open day and DOT is most ideal. Where a project is targeting married with children then Immunization and DOT as well as DOT with open days is convenient for these adolescents and youth. Stand alone is reaching more youth but very expensive as its reaching the least number of youth in comparison with the other models. Future programming should consider integration of open days and DOT and DOT co-located at immunization to realize more numbers of youth.</p>",

      "title": "The effectiveness of linking facility-based youth corners and youth clubs at community level to increase use of family planning and other reproductive health services by young people",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally, unique health issues associated with adolescence have been little understood or, in some cases, ignored. However, adolescent health and development was made an integral part of the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health because, in the words of the United Nations Secretary-General, adolescents are central to everything we want to achieve, and to the overall success of the 2030 Agenda. Their health and well-being are engines of change in the drive to create healthier, more sustainable societies.</p><p></p><p>Rwanda’s population is young, with 67% of all Rwandans under the age of 20. The increased use of family planning methods is a major priority for the Rwandan government. Contraceptive prevalence (CPR) among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) increased significantly from 10% in 2005 (GoR: 2005) to 45% in 2010 (GoR: 2010). CPR among adolescents and young adults also increased significantly during that time period.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In order to increase access to and use of family planning and other reproductive health services by adolescents and youth, the Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP) has supported the Ministry of Health (MOH)/Rwanda Biomedical Center to integrate youth-friendly health services in 10 districts, using a socio-ecological approach with activities at the individual (adolescent), family, community, health facility, and policy levels. As part of this approach, MCSP linked health facility-based youth corners and youth clubs at the community level.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Youth corners in each health facility offer a welcoming space for youth clients to participate in information, education, and communication (IEC) sessions and receive referrals for health services throughout the facility. ASRH focal points coordinate with youth club leaders to facilitate monthly IEC sessions on topics related to HIV, gender, contraception and FP methods. Youth club members visit health centres on a quarterly basis, during designated youth service times, for a study tour. This structured youth friendly facilities approach was implemented in 10 MCSP-supported districts in Rwanda from October 2015 to 2018. To ensure availability of adolescent-responsive health services, MCSP trained ASRH focal points, supported 287 providers to offer adolescent-responsive services, and conducted advocacy meetings with local district leaders to seek support for youth corner use and visibility.  At the community level, MCSP also initiated a <em>Parent – Adolescent Communication (PAC) </em>approach to promote a culture of communication and break silence around sexuality. Between January and March 2018 the PAC facilitators reached a total of 41,220 parents through Umuganda (monthly community work), and 55,620 adult community members via evening “parent sessions” with messages focusing on prevention of early pregnancy, and use of FP and ANC services.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The combination of adolescent-responsive health services and community outreach increased adolescents’ use of clinical services. From October 2016 to March 2017, 38,440 (19,536 young boys and 18,904 young girls) benefited from adolescent pregnancy prevention, FP, and ANC  messages given through IEC sessions at HCs. Between April and September 2017, participation in IEC sessions by adolescents increased to 76,994 (41,020 boys and 35,974 girls). In the same period, use of clinical services including VCT in MCSP-supported health facilities increased from 106,470 young people aged 10-24 (47,348 boys and 59,122 girls) from October 2016 to March 2017 to 323,415 young people (127,482 boys and 195,933 girls) between April and September 2017. From January to September 2017, 39,716 adolescent clients used FP, 38,586 used ANC and 27,770 used maternity services. Short-acting FP methods, particularly condoms and pills, were the most frequently selected by adolescents. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The following challenges were encountered and addressed. Lack of youth friendliness at health facilities has been mitigated by training providers and through advocacy meeting with district local leaders. As a result of this advocacy, all health facilities have initiated a “youth-friendly services time” to receive adolescent and young people.</p><p>Another challenge was the gap between health facilities and youth themselves; this was addressed by connecting community-based youth clubs to the nearest health facilities, which contributed to increasing utilization of health services by adolescents and young people.</p><p>Culture barriers prohibiting discussion of matters related to sexuality posed another barrier. Orienting parents in program villages to promote communication between parents and their children around reproductive health contributed to breaking silence about sexuality, which is taboo. </p><p>Negative perceptions and some social laws prevent some health services from being provided to certain groups of adolescents (e.g. the provision of contraceptives to unmarried adolescents). This was addressed by disseminating the ASRH policy and by orienting the health care providers on youth-friendliness in facilities have increased the freedom of young people to use FP and clinical services offered at facility and in community.</p>",

      "title": "Empowering young adolescents to avoid early marriage and delay first pregnancy-Based on DSW'S Young Adolescent Project Kenya",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Kenya young people (10-24 years) comprise about 34 percent of the total population, Sexual debut among this youthful population is quite early, before the age of 15 years. Even with low proportions (less than 20 per cent) of married adolescent females, Kenya is among the three countries in Africa, where adolescent fertility is high (United Nations, 2013).</p><p>In Kilifi county, early marriages and teenage pregnancies are among major health concerns affecting access to education within the region. For instance, the prevalence of child marriage in Kilifi stands at 47.7%. These are mainly due to early pregnancies where parents agree to marry off their daughters the moment they discover the pregnancy (Plan International, 2012). Early pregnancies not only lead to high rates of early marriages in this county, but also to high school dropout, low retention and completion among adolescent school girls. DSW’s Young Adolescent Project in Kenya is one of the DSW projects implemented in Kilifi County to create a supportive environment and improve SRHR information for young adolescents (10-14) in 9 primary schools in Kilifi County, Kenya.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The need to empower Young Adolescents (10-14 years) to avoid early marriage and delay of first pregnancy underscored the rationale for DSW Young Adolescent Project partnering with relevant Kilifi County Government ministries to implement a three year (2013-2015) and now in its scale up (2016-2018). The project aimed at:</p><ul>\t<li>Increasing access to SRHR information and services among 3000 young adolescents (10-14) years in nine primary schools in Kilifi County.</li>\t<li>Creating a supportive school and community environment for sexual and reproductive health and rights of young adolescents’</li>\t<li>Documenting and widely sharing project approaches and methodologies</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>DSW used a holistic and multi-faceted approach to target the needs of young adolescents. The project intervention was informed by a baseline survey which established benchmarks for monitoring progress against which the findings were deduced. The following summarizes key intervention areas based on the project impact for 2013-2015.  </p><p><em>Adolescent-friendly SRH information and commodities</em>: 80 teachers and 20 health service providers trained on adolescent friendly approaches to reduce discomfort associated with serving adolescents. 10000 IEC materials developed and distributed, 1500 menstrual wheels procured and distributed 4000 sanitary towels with underpants.</p><p><em>Parent- adolescent relationship</em>: 80 parents attended sexual education and counseling trainings and dialogues to improve communication skills and relationship between parent and adolescence on sexuality. Besides, young parents in the community were trained to counsel adolescents and their parents about SRH issues.</p><p><em>Community engagement</em> fostered a more supportive environment by breaking through community-level sociocultural barriers that adolescents face in accessing SRH information and services. Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) stimulated 37 community dialogues/sensitizations.</p><p><em>Peer education </em>equipped young adolescents with appropriate SRHR information to enable them make informed decisions on sexual behaviors. 90 young adolescents trained as peer educators reaching 3092 adolescents through peer learning sessions and referrals to health services.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The project conducted its end line evaluation in 2015 and significant changes were reported. More than 50% of young adolescents could easily name methods of preventing pregnancy compared to only 0.6% at baseline levels. While early pregnancies were reported as the cause of high school drop outs and early marriages, at least seven out of the nine target schools did not report any pregnancy related drop outs; From the 9 pilot schools, only 4 schools reported zero (Bodoi, Msumarini, Lugwe and Mtwapa) teenage pregnancies compared to at least 7 to 10 cases annually in the previous years.</p><p>Progress at teacher level was equally significant with 80% of teachers integrating reproductive health and HIV information as part of their teaching curriculum compared to 10% at the baseline. The project noted a higher retention rate of both boys and girls in all the targeted primary schools.</p><p>At individual levels, young adolescents showed more awareness and assertiveness as most of them (90%) were able to make better informed decisions on their SRH leading to reduced pregnancy cases with girls’ decision making power doubling since the inception of the project.</p><p>At community level, more than 70% of the community members were proactive and responsive to SRHR needs of young adolescents as compared to 42.1% during the baseline. Whereas the baseline data reported 25% comprehensive understanding of SRH for parents. During the end line evaluation,8 out of 10 parents openly discussed life and health choices with their children.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>A number of significant lessons have been learnt in the course of the project implementation. The following summarizes the learning points:</p><ul>\t<li>Adolescent pregnancy prevention interventions should focus on the formative stages of development indicating school based interventions as particularly effective.</li>\t<li>Parent-adolescent-teacher relationship is key to addressing SRH communication and information challenges</li>\t<li>Strengthening institutional linkages provides opportunities for holistic and multi -faceted information and services</li>\t<li>Provision of SRH commodities most particularly sanitary towels should be given a priority as intervention component for SRHR Programs targeting young adolescent in poverty stricken settings.</li>\t<li>Proper, child-friendly messaging and packaging is key towards ensuring an increased awareness on SRHR issues among adolescents</li>\t<li>Capacity building for teachers, health workers and parents ensures a critical mass for action-taking both at school and community levels, and is key to a more comprehensive approach to delivery of SRH related information and services.</li></ul><p>During the project pilot phase (2013-2015), an end line evaluation was done and the results presented. The project achieved tremendous gains which led to a scale up opportunity (2016-2018) and 18 new schools were recruited to benefit from the intervention.</p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>A growing body of literature suggests gender inequality informs poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. For example, adolescent males who ascribe to such norms were found to be more likely to have multiple concurrent sexual partners, hold negative attitudes about condom use, and less likely to access health care. Girls who endorse traditional gender norms are at elevated risk for young age at first birth, inconsistent condom use, and lower self-efficacy in HIV prevention. However, the majority of existing research has focused on adults or on gendered attitudes regarding restrictive constructions of masculinity. Few studies have explored normative views about boy/girl relationships among early adolescence, which corresponds to a critical time for their sexual development. Additionally, little research has investigated the associations between perceptions of gender norms about relationships and knowledge about access to family planning (FP).</p><p></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aims to explore the association between gender norms about romantic relationships and knowledge of access to family planning (FP) among very young adolescent (VYA) boys and girls aged 10-14 in Shanghai. We hypothesize that such an association may show gender-specific differences.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Baseline data from the Global Early Adolescent Study in Shanghai was analyzed, a longitudinal cohort study assessing gender norms and reproductive health across adolescence. The 1755 included adolescents were ages 10 to 14, living with family, enrolled in one of three selected Jing’an district public schools, assented and obtained parental consent. Data collection was completed in December 2017.</p><p></p><p>Key predictor variables were gendered attitudes towards romantic relationships measured by two scales: sexual double standard (11 items, polychoric ordinal (PO) cronbach’s alpha: 0.85), which addresses gendered perceptions of social ramifications of romantic relationships, and romantic relationship acceptability (5 items, PO cronbach’s alpha: 0.86), which evaluates gender-equal views on acceptability of romantic relationships in early adolescence. Scores ranged from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating stronger endorsement of each construct. </p><p></p><p>The outcome of knowledge about FP access was assessed by two binary measures: knowledge of where to access 1) condoms and 2) contraception. </p><p></p><p>We conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to assess associations between gender norms and FP knowledge about access. Models were adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, wealth) and factors thought to be related to knowledge about FP access (perceived peer sexual history, pregnancy knowledge, relationship history). </p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>On average, adolescent girls were more likely to endorse the sexual double standards than boys 2.78 (SD 0.73) versus 2.56 (SD 0.76) (p</p><p>On average, scores for acceptability of adolescent romantic relationships were higher for boys than girls 2.85 (SD 1.03) versus 2.74 (SD 0.98) (p=0.023). Results suggested equal acceptability of boys’ and girls’ adolescent romantic relationships was positively associated with knowledge about where to get a condom or where to get contraception. Specifically, odds of knowing where to access condoms and odds of knowing where to get contraception were significantly increased for those who strongly endorsed equal acceptance of boys’ and girls’ romantic relationships in early adolescents (mean score = 5) (boys condoms: OR: 11.72, 95% CI [5.99-22.94], p</p> ",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Limited research has evaluated the differential association between gender norms about relationships and knowledge about FP access among VYA boys and girls, with a focus on an Asian adolescent population. The results of this study show gender norms are prevalent in early adolescents, and correlated with SRH knowledge acquisition, even before the need for contraception arises, as most VYA have never been exposed to pregnancy risk. Further research is warranted to confirm this link and further evaluate these associations over time as young people transition towards being sexually active.</p><p></p><p>These results suggest interventions that aim to improve adolescent SRH could benefit from a focus on gender equality, in addition to existing programs that focus on SRH education. Further, these findings support interventions targeted at girls to help them challenge sexual double standard gender norms that disadvantage girls in romantic relationships, and thereby enhance self-efficacy in FP access. </p> ",

      "title": "Increasing Knowledge of Very Young Adolescents (VYAs), (10 – 14) for Better Choices Using Life Skills; a Case of Mathare Informal Settlements",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The number of very young adolescents (VYAs) in the world is increasing, with an estimated 545 million living in third world countries[1]. In Kenya, VYAs (10-14 years) represent 12.3% of the total population[2].   This period marks a critical time of transition from childhood to adolescence, where they experience physical, hormonal changes, develop attitudes and experiment with behaviors that affect present and future wellbeing.  VYAs lack knowledge and skills to reduce associated risks of puberty, including unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Reaching out to VYAs with accurate information on sexual reproductive health, careers and behavior sets the stage for better health, and safer sexual reproductive health outcomes. Few adolescent-focused public health programs address the unique needs of VYAs, with the majority focusing on older adolescents (15-19). The goal of the urban health project is to develop and document models that are effective and scalable towards ASRH[3] and WASH[4] in urban slums. To achieve these, the project targeted VYA from Korogocho and Mathare informal settlements to provide information on puberty, menstruation and avoiding pregnancy, drug abuse, relationships, rights and financial literacy.  </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The project intervention built on an existing mentorship platform dubbed KUZA (Kiswahili word for mentorship) which had proved successful in mentoring older adolescents in Viwandani informal settlements on life skills.  This intervention focused on providing age appropriate information to VYAs on topics on self-esteem and personal image, sexual reproductive health, changes in the body during puberty, menstrual hygiene, relationships, rights and basic financial literacy, all using a Kuza manual.  The manual contains four main topics including “Knowing Yourself”, Relationships, Rights and Financial literacy.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The project activity was evaluated using a baseline and end line survey.  Mathare informal settlements was purposefully selected due to high rates of teenage pregnancies, drug abuse and violence against young adolescent girls. Local leaders were informed on the project to seek consent and support. To recruit the five mentors, a two-week advertisement was placed at the chief’s office and interviews conducted. Mentor selection criteria included: women aged 19-24, from the community, completed high school, and currently attending college or university. The mentors then partook a 5-day training (facilitated by project alumni) and then each identified ten mentees from their catchment area, in consultation with community health volunteer – making 50 participants in total. Eligibility for the mentees included: girls aged 10-14, not involved in any donor-funded program, known behavioral issues and from a vulnerable home </p><p>A structured baseline and midline questionnaires were administered during the first meeting and six months later. The aim was to assessing initial knowledge of the girls on the various topics and their perceptions on the issues affecting them in puberty.  The filled in questionnaires were analyzed to asses increase in knowledge and perceptions of the girls on Kuza sessions.   </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The project began in September 2017 and is ongoing, thus results to date are preliminary. Twelve mentorship sessions have been conducted so far, with 50 mentees. Based on the baseline findings, there has been a 70% increase in the knowledge and perception on issues of self-esteem, puberty, menstrual hygiene, goal setting and sexual reproductive health.</p><p>Through personal testimonies, parents have noted better behavior in the girls who are undergoing the mentorship sessions and improved relationships between themselves and the adolescents.</p><p>During field visits, the mentees focused on questions on setting life goals for their future and how best they can go about it. .</p><p>The mentors have also proven to be key resource persons in the community in the lives of the adolescents as they are a go between, with the parents using them as reference points to provide guidance to the younger adolescents. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Engaging community gatekeepers, e.g. the chief, parents who are key stakeholders is important for buy in. The chief helped in the identification of areas with great need, while the parents help in the support of the project, as they know it is important for their daughters. </p><p>Using local mentors is useful as they understand and are able to relate to the community culture having undergone the same community experience. The mentees are able to better relate with mentors from their community. </p><p>Parents use the mentors to reach out to their girls when they are facing challenges dealing with them. Working with a local mentor also creates a sense of trust for the parents as they have seen the mentors grow and succeed. </p><p>Exposure outside the slum environment allows the girls to aim higher and focus on their education to be able to achieve their dreams.</p><p> </p>",

      "title": "The Sexual and Reproductive Health Knowledge of Early Adolescents in Kinshasa and the Influence of Interpersonal Factors: An Assessment of Baseline Data from Phase II of the Global Early Adolescent Study, 2017",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Possession of appropriate knowledge of conception and HIV and mechanisms for prevention is an important first step to taking control of one’s sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Early adolescence (ages 10 to 14 years) is a critical juncture for knowledge acquisition, behavior formation, and decision making that can have notable impacts on long-term health and well-being of this population as they age. However, available evidence indicates that early adolescents lack accurate SRH information, which in turn hinders knowledge and practice of healthy behaviors. Interpersonal relationships can play an important role in influencing SRH knowledge; for many youth around the globe, parents and peers are primary sources of SRH information, though with variable results. However, the influence of these relationships on young people’s SRH knowledge are relatively under explored. In countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where approximately 12% of young women give birth before age 18 years and abstinence remains the recommended method of contraception for youth, it is important to better understand early adolescent’s SRH knowledge and influences. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study sought to better understand the SRH knowledge of early adolescents in Kinshasa, DRC. As relationships with parents, peers, and partners have been noted in the literature as important influences regarding the acquisition of accurate SRH knowledge among youth, this study aimed to discern if and how such interpersonal relationships, and the qualities and characteristics therein, are associated with SRH knowledge among early adolescents. Recognizing the differential effects that sex and school status can have, this analysis also aimed to discern if the associations between interpersonal factors and SRH knowledge varied by sex and by school status. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Global Early Adolescent Study (GEAS) is a quasi-experimental, longitudinal study that seeks to address knowledge gaps regarding early adolescence. Baseline survey data was utilized from respondents in the control arm of Phase II of the GEAS in Kinshasa (n=1,375). This data was collected from early adolescents who reside with a family and their caregivers in two poor urban communities using cross-culturally validated instruments developed in Phase I of the GEAS. SRH knowledge was assessed through HIV and pregnancy knowledge indices derived from four and eight questions reflecting knowledge of these two topics, respectively. Three of these questions directly pertained to family planning (FP) and gauged knowledge of condoms, oral contraceptives and injectables. Interpersonal factors regarding caregivers, peers, and partners were assessed as predictor variables. Control variables included age, education, and wealth. Bivariate and multivariate linear regressions were used to elucidate the factors significantly associated with SRH knowledge. Differences in predictors of SRH knowledge by sex and school status were tested and as a result a stratified analysis by both sex and school enrollment was utilized.  Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Kinshasa School of Public Health.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>On average respondents correctly answered either 5 or 6 of the 12 SRH knowledge questions and specifically 1 out of 3 of the FP knowledge questions. These results are noteworthy as roughly 10% of the sample reported experience with a romantic relationship. Overall, male respondents and those currently enrolled in school demonstrated better SRH knowledge. Notable differences by sex and school status were observed. Among male respondents, both in and out of school, having some or many friends who have engaged in romantic activities or, in a few cases, sexual activities, was observed to have notable, positive influence on knowledge of HIV (ß: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.60 and ß: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.37, 1.19, respectively) as well as of pregnancy (ß: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.30, 1.02 and ß: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.52, 1.76, respectively). Communication with a caregiver about SRH matters was positively associated with pregnancy knowledge for females in school (ß: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.98) and communication with both a caregiver and a peer was likewise significant for out of school females (ß: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.09, 1.71 and ß: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.10, 1.58, respectively). Ever or currently having a romantic partner was associated with increased pregnancy knowledge for female respondents, both in and out of school (ß: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.23 and ß: 1.30, 95% CI: 0.37, 2.23, respectively). And having a friend of the opposite sex was positively associated with HIV knowledge for out of school females (ß: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.96). </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The SRH of early adolescents remains relatively understudied throughout the globe, including in the DRC. The results of this study underscore the need for continued and mounting efforts to better understand and meet the SRH knowledge needs of early adolescents in Kinshasa, and elsewhere. Consideration of interpersonal determinants offers notable insights as to how relationships with caregivers, peers, and partners may influence and facilitate greater SRH knowledge. These findings uphold the value of further study to discern how these interpersonal factors could be meaningfully utilized and enhanced to support early adolescent SRH through provision of accurate SRH information. It is anticipated that this research could successfully inform such interventions as a community-based peer education program or an intervention focused on strengthening relationships between caregivers and their early adolescents. Additionally, existing policies, such as those around the national SRH education curriculum, could be strengthened through incorporating interpersonal elements (e.g. requiring schools to involve caregivers or pair students with trained peer mentors). Finally, the significant differences observed by sex and school enrollment status maintain the need for both research and programmatic efforts with early adolescents to account and make provisions for these groups in their design. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Le taux de prévalence contraceptive moderne au Mali est parmi les plus bas dans le monde, contribuant aux naissances rapprochées et des taux élevés de mortalité maternelle et infantile (EDSM V, 2012-13). Un des engagements du Ministère du Mali est de renforcer les activités de changement de comportement autour de la planification familiale (PF) ciblant davantage les jeunes, les adolescents, les femmes et les hommes.</p><p></p><p>PSI Mali renforce le système sanitaire et les marchés sanitaires pour mettre plus de contrôle dans les mains des femmes, hommes, et adolescents. Autrefois les hommes ont été moins ciblés dans les activités de la PF. Cependant leur apport est fondamental pour soutenir le développement et la pérennisation des interventions en matière de PF. Selon l’EDS V, seulement 10% des femmes ont un pouvoir de décision sur leurs propres soins de santé au Mali. Leurs partenaires jouent un grand rôle dans la prise de décision et l’accès des femmes à la PF et les hommes peuvent prendre la responsabilité d’utiliser certaines méthodes eux-mêmes.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>L’Ecole des Maris, est une initiative de UNFPA Niger, dont PSI Mali s’est inspiré, elle constitue à identifier quelques maris modèles qui sensibilisent leurs pairs à changer de comportement pour l’amélioration de la santé de la famille. Cela permet de lutter contre la mortalité maternelle et infantile. Nos sages-femmes, sensibilisent les femmes sur la PF et l’équipe de vidéo mobile (MVU) passe pour sensibiliser et mobiliser la population, à utiliser les services PF. Les maris modèles mènent des activités, préparent l’arrivée du MVU et ensuite accueil les sages-femmes le lendemain pour la prestation des services PF.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>PSI Mali en collaboration avec le Gouvernement du Mali a initié la stratégie Ecole des Maris en 2015 dans les régions de Sikasso et Kayes en mettant en place onze (11) Ecoles. En 2017, PSI Mali a mise en place sept (7) nouvelles Ecoles des Maris, 5 à Sikasso et 2 à Bamako Péri-urbain à travers le projet dénommé « Bangé Kolossi Nyèta » pour la promotion de la Planification Familiale, financé par l’Ambassade Royale des Pays Bas. L’approche utilise la Communication Interpersonnelle (CIP) à travers des visites à domicile et les causeries éducatives lors des évènements culturels du village comme les festivals de balafon, de danse, des fêtes traditionnelles.</p><p></p><p>L’identification des sites fut réalisée avec l’appui des Directions régionales de la santé. Après les prospections, l’équipe d’implémentation s’est entretenue avec les communautés.</p><p>Les cibles principales sont les hommes de tout âge, mariés qui refusent que leurs femmes et enfants fréquentent les centres de santé    </p><p></p><p>Les données sont enregistrées dans des registres au niveau des centres de santé  avec les fiches de références et contre références ; ensuite la remontée des données des Ecoles des Maris est assurée par DHIS2 suivant le schéma national (CSCom-CSRef-DRS-DNS).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Les 18 Ecoles des Maris fonctionnent avec 182 Maris modèles, recrutés et formés en techniques de CIP et SR ; ils  ont mené depuis 2015, 70 630 causeries éducatives auprès des hommes, pour la création de la demande de services SR. Ils communiquent sur les avantages de la santé de la mère et de l’enfant. Les sensibilisations ont touchées 194 563  personnes avec 115 131 références dont 69 078,6 PF soit 60% ; 17 669,65 CPN soit 15% ; 13 815,72 accouchement assistés soit 12% ; 5 756,55 CPoN soit 5% ; 9 210,48 vaccination des enfants soit 8%. Après les sensibilisations, les maris modèles réfèrent les intéressés vers les centres de santé communautaires en leur donnant des cartes de références; 359 réunions ont été organisées. Les Directions Régionales de la Santé et PSI Mali ont réalisé 20 supervisions conjointes. Pour assurer la qualité des services et la remontée des données, les Superviseurs CIP ont effectués 168 suivis rapprochés.</p><p>Les Coachs, les Directeurs Techniques des CSCOM, et les Points Focaux impliqués dans la mise en œuvre de la stratégie ont été formés sur la Dynamique du groupe, la CIP, le Leadership et le Coaching. La stratégie a eu comme impact : une prise de conscience sur la problématique de la SR. Avant l’implémentation des Ecoles Des Maris, les services PF et la CPoN n’existaient pas dans ces zones, 60/an avant l’approche contre 4 605.24/an après l’approche pour les accouchements assistés, 5 890/an actuellement pour les CPN contre, 52/an avant.</p>",

      "title": "Effective male engagement to increase family planning uptake in Benin",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Benin is one of many African countries struggling to improve access to quality health care for their population, thereby reducing maternal and infant mortality. To achieve this goal, the Benin Ministry of Health designed a package of high-impact interventions (PHII), which includes family planning (FP). Although the country has been implementing various programs to strengthen FP services since the 1980s, contraceptive prevalence has been growing very slowly. According to Benin’s Demographic and Health Surveys conducted during the last fifteen years, less than one woman out of ten uses a modern contraceptive method: 7.2% in 2001, 6.1% in 2006 and 7.9% in 2012. Furthermore, unmet need for FP was estimated at 32% in 2012.</p><p>Knowing the importance of FP, Benin formally committed to accelerating progress on FP at the launch of the Ouagadougou partnership. Thus, the Benin 2013 FP Repositioning Action Plan includes interventions aimed at improving FP, including effective male engagement. In fact, men play a dominant role in Benin households. However, they are not consistently targeted by health programs, including FP programs.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Supporting the Ministry of Health’s PHII, the USAID-funded Advancing Newborn, Child and Reproductive Health Program (ANCRE), implemented by University Research Co., LLC, works in ten health zones across the country. USAID/ANCRE's approach aims to strengthen the capacity of health providers to be self-sustaining in quality service delivery, including FP. Through participatory coaching, the program focuses its efforts on improving provider skills to identify performance gaps as well as local solutions to fill them. Community activities extend the work of the health providers to promote FP.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Using the improvement model <em>Plan, Do, Study, Act</em>, USAID/ANCRE coaches health providers to identify both shortcomings that affect quality of service delivery and possible changes to address identified bottlenecks. The Program also supports providers to implement the changes and monitor health clinics’ action plans. Tested and studied changes that are shown to be effective are considered good practices and shared with other health facilities.</p><p>One of the best practices found to improve contraceptive prevalence in the Program’s health zones is using men as advocates for FP. The Gankpodo health center initiated an approach to increase male involvement in FP in April 2016 by taking advantage of the presence of male spouses when women leave the maternity ward. These men receive counseling to obtain their support for FP. Further discussions on FP are given during mother classes, which are organized when couples come back with their newborns six days after giving birth.</p><p>To take the message into surrounding communities, Gankpodo established groups of ‘committed men’ to facilitate mother classes, sensitize other men in the surrounding neighborhoods and organize meetings with community leaders on the benefits of FP. The approach has spread to 47 health facilities in the 10 supported health zones.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Male engagement helped increase the use of FP services in the 47 supported health facilities. Within a 12-month period, postpartum FP counseling increased from 4,082 to 8,803, an improvement of more than 100%. More than 30% as many mothers of children under the age of 12 months accepted a long-acting contraceptive method (6,033 to 8,875) between 2016 and 2017. The monthly average contraceptive uptake has increased from 503 mothers in 2016 to 740 in 2017.</p><p>The men as advocates approach also generated evidence on male engagement for FP that will be beneficial for decision-makers to scale up this intervention nationwide.</p><p>By being identified as a good practice, the Gankpodo's experience was scaled-up to 47 other health facilities, which resulted in an increase of FP uptake.</p><p>Furthermore, thanks to the training and coaching received, health providers in the supported health zones are equipped to provide FP counseling and services. The approach also strengthened data use for decision making. USAID/ANCRE worked with the involved health zones to analyze data about counseled couples and new FP users’ origin, which was used to inform targeted awareness raising campaigns in neighboring communities.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Social and cultural models imposed on males and females influence their perception and acceptance of FP. In Benin, men are often the first decision makers in the household, especially when it comes to decisions related to family size. Understanding the importance of FP was shown to shift men’s attitudes toward becoming advocates for its use, improving FP uptake. Groups of <em>committed men </em>helped increase FP uptake in supported sites by sharing their own experience with other men both at the health facility and in their communities.</p><p>Documentation of the male engagement approach implemented in supported sites provides usable data to inform policies and programs in Benin.</p><p>Change is more effective and gives remarkable results when it is intrinsic. This approach, initiated by a health center, was very well accepted by other health facilities that were experiencing the same issues. In addition, this approach was implemented without any additional material or financial investments.</p><p>Seizing opportunities to integrate service delivery remains a winning approach.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In September 2013, several barangays in Zamboanga City were taken over by armed men from a Muslim separatist movement. Residents had to evacuate from their homes into overcrowded evacuation camps; several houses were razed. Among the barangays attacked was Barangay Sta. Catalina. Zamboanga City is one of the most culturally diverse places in the Philippines. The dominant vernacular is Chavacano, a creole of Spanish with a sprinkling of Philippine dialects. While the city is majority Christian, many residents are Muslim, coming from different tribes. By late 2014, Sta. Catalina residents, predominantly Muslim, had started to rebuild their lives and some moved into resettlement sites within the area. Health monitoring on maternal and child health conducted after the end of the hostilities recorded a drastic drop in the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR). In the first quarter of 2015, CPR was 31%, well below the regional rate of 47%. In December 2014, planning started on a communication project to address maternal and child health issues, particularly the high rate of unplanned pregnancies. The dominance of men in decision-making in the family curtails the women's freedom of choice to use responsible family planning methods which causes the increase in unplanned pregnancies.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>EL HOMBRE is a four-hour learning package for men and by men themselves. Its main communication channel was a peer-to-peer approach a simple conversation between men and among men discussing family matters, family plans, and family planning even as a discussion of contraception is gradually introduced into the picture. The brochure is the main material used in the session; it contains substantial information and work-sheet for family planning. In between sessions, an animated film is shown by the resource person and the participants were encouraged to share their views, followed by a synthesis of the advocates.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The project site is located in Sta. Catalina, Zamboanga City, an urban community, dominantly resided by informal settlers. The project is underpinned by a process of formative research, consultations; focus group discussions take into account the lived realities of the women and men in the community. The assessment results suggest that there is an increasing unwanted pregnancies and demand for modern family planning among women, which is objected by men. The proponent incorporated several modalities in solving community problems. Hence, the project is grounded from the principles of community participatory action research and bridging leadership to encourage the people to own the problem and create solutions. EL HOMBRE was developed by the community, facilitated by the proponent discussion is supported by materials developed by them, such as animated film and brochures. Men are trained on various life skills to make them more responsible in their sexual and reproductive behaviors and relationships. The intention of the project was to engage men in the community to be responsive to gender issues and to participate in the promotion of health of the family. Monitoring CPR and reports related to GBV is the main indicator of the effectiveness of the project.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Prior to the implementation of the strategy, the number of men involved in promoting health and women empowerment was 38, including health officials. The project with the controlled poplation was terminated in the 2nd quarter of 2015, the number rose to 92 active members advocating EL HOMBRE in the community with their respective families. Continuous monitoring indicated that the number of men involved in the advocacy gradually rose in the 3rd quarter to 158 and 239 at the end of 2015. There is also a gradual increase in the CPR from 31% in the first quarter to 39% in the 2nd quarter. More significantly, by the end of 2015 CPR had reached 59%. Due to its success, EL HOMBRE will be expanded to all 98 barangays of Zamboanga City. In 2017, POPCOM IX will implement the project as one of its demand generation activities in Region IX.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Community participatory action research and bridging leadership combined is an effective method in solving community problems. The leadership role of the proponent influences the community to be co-owners of the problems; thus, co-create effective solutions. EL HOMBRE is effective learning package as it is tailored-fit for its intended audience. Increased in CPR is an indicator that the session is taking effect in the lives of the people. Attaining the need of couples for modern family planning of couples is one way of eradicating maternal and neonatal mortalities, government and other stakeholders should continue in its efforts in demand generation activities to address this health issue. Finally, efficient use and conduct of the program will help eliminate Violence Against Women and Children in the community as evidenced by the key results of the project.</p>",

Hormis les barrières géographiques, financières et politiques, les barrières culturelles  qui induisent en grande partie les comportements, attitudes et pratiques, constituent un frein à l’accès des services SR aux hommes, aux femmes, aux garçons et aux filles. Par ailleurs, les hommes et les garçons sont toujours détenteurs du pouvoir et des ressources, leur faible implication dans les services SR engendre la faible fréquentation et utilisation desdits services avec des besoins non satisfaits estimés à 32,7% selon MICS du Togo 2010. L’un des indicateurs de cette faible utilisation est le taux de prévalence contraceptive moderne qui est de 17,1% en 2013. L’un des effets de la faible implication des hommes et des garçons dans la SR/PF est la prévalence élevée des violences basées sur le genre avec son corollaire de décès  maternels et infantiles très élevés. </p>",

      "title": "Family Planning and Unintended Births of Child Brides in Conflict Zones",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Child marriage, as defined by UNICEF, is a formal or informal union where either or both the parties is below 18 years of age. In conflict settings, child marriages have been used as a protection mechanism as parents perceive it to be ‘the best’ option which can provide ‘safety and security’ to the girl child. Also, conflict settings can lead the parents to make certain decisions or choices which they would not have preferred in normal settings. However, on contrary, child marriages increase the threat of violence viz. physical, verbal, sexual and psychological on the girl child. Importantly, child marriage is an impediment to girls’ education and thus hinders their overall development curbing their work and growth opportunities. Thus, child brides hardly have any sex, contraception and family planning related awareness and are subjugated to forced sexual relations or intimate partner violence. This can lead to multiple unintended pregnancies and repeated childbirths. Moreover, the situation can aggravate during conflicts when social relationships, health services and state infrastructure get disrupted or discontinued. So, as the countries endeavor to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), child marriages and family planning in conflict zones seek attention for broader development concerns.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The research questions study focuses on are: What are the family planning methods used by child brides in conflict zones? What is the pattern and intention of use of family planning methods among child brides in conflict zones? How does child marriages effect pattern and intention of use of family planning methods of women in conflict zones? What are the differentials for unintended births between child brides and women married at 18 and above in conflict zones? How does child marriages effect unintended births among women in conflict zones?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study has analysed Demographic and Health Surveys data of five conflict affected countries namely Afghanistan (DHS, 2015), Cameroon (DHS, 2011), Liberia (DHS, 2013), Sierra Leone (DHS, 2013) and Yemen (2013) using bivariate and multivariate analysis. The main outcome variables chosen were: Current contraceptive method use, Pattern of contraceptive use, Intention of contraceptive use and unintended birth. For calculating unintended births, the study used three methods: 1. Retrospective method based on the question ‘whether the last birth was wanted?’, 2. Based on the question ‘whether the current pregnancy is wanted?’, 3. Using Lightbourne method which uses ideal number of children and total number of children for a woman to calculate unintended births. The main predictor variable chosen was: Age at marriage. The other predictor or control variables used were: Age, Education, Occupation, Spousal Education, Spousal occupation, Contraceptive pattern, Total children ever born, Current pregnancy status, Desire for more children, Wealth Index, Urban/ Rural, Country of residence. For statistical analysis, the study has used cross-tabulation with Pearson Chi-Square test and Binomial Logistic regression model with odds ratios.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Child brides are shown to have higher proportion for not using any contraceptive method than women married at 18 and above. Pills and Injections are more prevalent methods of contraception than others among the child brides who are using any contraceptive method. The unadjusted percentages for pattern of contraceptive use shows that child brides have higher proportion (57.15 percent) of never using any contraception compared to women married at 18 and above (55.31 percent). Further, adjusting for socio-economic factors, child brides are found to have highly significantly higher odds (1.13, p<p>The unadjusted prevalence of unintended births estimated using all three methods (last birth wanted, current pregnancy wanted and Lightbourne method) showed higher percentages for child brides (26.80 percent, 29.48 percent and 34.08 percent respectively) than women married at 18 and above (22.84 percent, 27.65 percent and 29.31 percent respectively). Further, adjusted odds ratios of having unintended births using all three methods also showed higher odds for child brides (1.12, p &lt; 0.01; 1.28, p &lt; 0.01; 1.31, p &lt; 0.01 respectively) compared to women married at 18 and above.</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Meeting family planning needs of women is a critical milestone on the way to achieve Sustainable Development Goals or Agenda 2030, especially in conflict affected countries. Despite several mandates and international laws, child marriage is yet a reality as a flourishing practice. There have been a number of studies which have focused on child marriages in some developing and under developed countries; very few have studied child marriages in conflict zones and its effects on family planning and unintended births. The present study using data from five conflict affected countries namely Afghanistan, Cameroon, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Yemen, thus has tried to fill the research gap. The study found that child brides in conflict zones have higher chances of not using any contraceptive or family planning methods currently and having lesser intentions of using them in future. Further, the study demonstrates that child brides have significantly higher risks of unintended births in conflict zones. The study indicates that child brides may face added burden of sexual and reproductive health risks due to their marriages before 18 years of age. The study contributes to the literature on child marriages, family planning, reproductive, maternal and child health studies.</p>",

The rationale behind carrying out this project is Zimbabwe has a high teenage birth rate and unmet need for contraception. The current fertility rate is 110 per 1000 live births among girls aged 15-19 years (ZDHS, 2015). The unmet need for Family Planning for the unmarried 15–19 age group is at 45.8% and for the 20– 24 age group, it increases to 64.2%. The situation is worse for those in rural areas especially in internally displaced locations who do not have access to adequate and comprehensive SRHR information and services.The total estimated demand to access Family Planning for the 15-19 age group is 78.4%, which increases to 86.5% in the 20-24 age group (ZDHS 2015), hence the need for carrying out this project. </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>1. Building capacity of 20 AGYW with skills , information and knowledge on contraceptive advocacy through trainings and mentorship.</p><p>2. Advocacy Data Dialogues with service providers from NGOs, Ministry of Health and other key stakeholder for increased coverage of undeserved/humanitarian areas by advocating for mobile FP clinics for Long acting methods and use of community based youth distributors.</p><p>3. Community engagement through the use of theatre for development to challenge knowledge, attitudes, practises and norms that act as a barrier for unmarried AGYW to access contraception</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Location- Mashonaland East Province</p><p>Setting- The area has a huge population of former farm workers, miners who were displaced due to econoic hardships in the country and characterised by huge family sizes as a result of poor family planning making it hard for the off springs to be catered for with adequate meals and also basic education. The female teenage prevalence in Marondera Rural District is at 31,5% rendering it the third highest in Mashonaland province(2012 Census Report).This has resulted in many young girls dropping out of school and left with little option but to be married or fall pregnant as a way to alleviate poverty. What has been the order is the age at which young girls are falling pregnant and becoming mothers, with no health institution close by knowledge and access levels of contraceptives is relatively low among the young girls. </p><p>Data source-Desk reviews , Digital Confessions from affected AGYW</p><p>Time frame:May 2016- May 2017</p><p>Intended decision maker: Ministry of Health and Child Care and Populaton Services Zimbabwe an affiliate to Marie Stopes International</p><p>Intended beneficiaries: Adolescent girls and young women 10-24 years</p><p>Participants size: +/- 1500 AGYW</p><p>Advocacy approach:A combiantion of lobbying and activisim based on reallife examples and evidence and story telling</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>1.Issues of SRHR for adolescent girls and young women are treated with contempt. However storytelling brings clear cut realities to people and communities, so as to stimulate action. For example during the Girls Choose Smart Contraception Training, partners from Population Services Zimbabwe, pledged to fully support as many family planning mobile clinics as needed to reach a 1000 girls with information and services after, the pregnant 17 year old girl shared her story.</p><p>2. Inclusion of marginalised AGYW as champions for the project created a sense of onwership which led to great success in terms of mobilising their peers to access vontraceptives as well and it also brought a reality to targeted decision makers on the importance of providing mobile services for SRHR</p><p>3. Knowledge, attitudes, practises and behaviours can be challenge using various methods and theatre for development in this instance worked as it gave communities an opportunity to reflect on the society they would prefer one that has informed AGYW accessing comprehensive SRHR services or one that has AGYW who succumb to teenage pregnancies and are school dropouts.This also had a direct imoact on families.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>1. Dialogues between service providers and affected populations brings in a new spectrum in service delivery as in the end Population Services Zimbabwe and Ministry of Health managed to provide the much needed mobile services, manned with youth friendly health care workers.</p><p>2. Meaningful youth engagament and participation is only meaningful if young people are given an opportunity to come up with solutions to their challenges and also supported to implement the solutions.</p><p>3. This project also ushered ina new campaign idea of challenging the laws on age of consent in accessing contraceptives. In Zimbabwe there is no clear guideleines so its left at the discretion of service providers and this then becomes a barrier because services providers are prone to their own attitudes, values and beliefs which if applied to the whole situation may affect access to contraceptives espcially for unmarried AGYW</p>",

Data was summarized using univariate and multivaribale logistic regression model to determine the magnitude and the factors associated with utilization.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, 47.7% young women were utilizing contraceptive methods in the refugee camp. Injectable contraceptive was the most frequently used method (63%) followed by oral contraceptives (25.5%). Desire for more children in the camp (39%) and inconvenient service site (21.4%) were the main reasons for non-using contraception methods in the refugee camp. Being a single women [AOR=0.17, 95%CI: 0.031,0.914], unemployed [AOR=0.21, 95%CI:0.001,0.392], no partner support [AOR=0.006, 95%CI:0.001,0.044], inconvenient service site [AOR=0.089,95%CI:0.013, 0.595] were negatively associated with the utilization of modern contraceptive methods.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The current contraceptive prevalence rate in the refugee is low. So, it is better if much effort is given to support young women by improving the health service delivery point, protecting from violence and creating an employment opportunity in the refugee camps.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Humanitarian needs continue to grow globally with women and girls disproportionately affected, Save the Children is institutionalizing family planning (FP), postabortion care (PAC), and the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for reproductive health across all humanitarian health programs. Through internal advocacy, technical assistance, and systems change focused on linking FP, PAC, and the MISP to Save the Children’s humanitarian health response work, we have delivered quality FP services to 119,129 women in 12 countries (including Rwanda) from April 2016-December 2017. Using case studies from our programs—the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh, Pakistan, DRC, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Rwanda, Niger; Haiti, Uganda, and Kenya—we will present the successes, challenges and lessons learned to institutionalizing FP, PAC, and the MISP across Save the Children humanitarian health responses. We will focus on internal advocacy and integrated program delivery including: (1) rapid deployment teams (2) an agency-wide internal education campaign, (3) training and capacity building, and (4) systems strengthening across M&amp;E and pharmacy functions.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Over the span of three years (2016-2018), Save the Children is building on its past emergency and development experience to integrate FP, PAC, and the MISP into its humanitarian health responses.  To achieve this, we are taking the following steps:</p><ul>\t<li>Ensure FP, PAC, and the MISP are a standard component of humanitarian health response.</li>\t<li>Build Save the Children’s institutional knowledge and technical capacity at headquarters, regional and country levels.</li>\t<li>Key platforms (pharmacy, M&amp;E) are strengthened to include FP, PAC and the MISP.</li>\t<li>Bring about an enabling policy environment and maintain high-level organizational commitments for FP, PAC, and the MISP.</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>In this session, we will present lessons learned from Save the Children’s internal advocacy efforts to influence and deliver FP and PAC programs. Key approaches include:</p>\t<li><strong>Rapid deployment teams </strong>respond in 72 hours following an emergency across all health responses and include a dedicate midwife trained in delivering FP, PAC, and the MISP in addition to an operational lead, clinical staff, and logistician.</li>\t<li><strong>An agency-wide internal education campaign </strong>with targeted messages and tools/resources by job function. With a core mission to serve children, the messaging connected FP and PAC to child survival and the organization’s global strategy. It was also necessary to create trainings and relevant resources for staff in various roles (e.g. online courses on delivering FP and PAC for health advisors, concept notes and budgets for fundraising staff, materials and talking points for communications staff).</li>\t<li><strong>Training and capacity building </strong>to increase the delivery of quality programming through supportive supervision, curricula, face to face instruction, and access to and use of technical resources and e-learning.</li>\t<li><strong>Systems strengthening across M&amp;E and pharmacy functions.</strong></li>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In this session, we will present lessons learned from Save the Children’s internal advocacy efforts to influence and deliver FP and PAC programs. Key accomplishments include:</p>\t<li><strong>Rapid deployment midwives</strong> are integrated into all health responses and funded through the dedicated FP and PAC program to ensure that skilled clinicians reach women in need. Over the course of this project, we delivered FP and PAC services in 100% of category 1 responses, and 80% of Category 2 response countries with a health component. Case studies to highlight include the Rohingya response in Bangladesh, Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, and Yemen integration with OFDA’s response.</li>\t<li><strong>An agency-wide internal education campaign </strong>reached over 20,000 staff in 120+ offices worldwide.</li>\t<li><strong>Training and capacity building </strong>has reached nearly 1,000 clinical providers.</li>\t<li><strong>Systems strengthening across M&amp;E and pharmacy functions </strong>to integrate FP, PAC and the MISP across HMIS system and systematize the virtual supply stock and procurement systems to provide commodities. Save the Children’s global HMIS system was updated to include FP, PAC and MISP indicators in emergency responses, and the medical catalogue and stock management systems were updated to guide programs in ordering supplies and reducing stock-outs.</li>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>In order to integrate FP, PAC, and the MISP across all emergency health responses, it was critical to articulate the foundational links between reproductive health and Save the Children’s core work to reach children. Once targeted messages connecting family planning and reproductive health to child survival and well-being were developed, it was important to develop a dissemination plan to reach staff across levels, job functions and countries through a variety of channels including webinars, online sharing, e-learning course, and informative communications.</p><p>In addition to educating and influencing staff at all levels throughout the organization, Save the Children developed a capacity development approach that was applied in each of the countries based upon the latest evidence-based practices to enable and support staff to promote FP,  PAC, and the MISP across the organization from programming to  fundraising, and communications. The existence of standardized templates and packages specifically related to FP, PAC, and the MISP in emergencies for proposals and concept notes, communications and program materials were instrumental for staff to develop and turnaround effective communication materials, fundraising, and overall program implementation in a timely manner, a critical issue in rapidly changing humanitarian contexts.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Decades of conflict and general insecurity have resulted in a complex humanitarian crisis with 4.1 million people displaced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  The national maternal mortality rate is 846 per 100 000 live births, 8%  of women in union and 5% of women aged 15 to 19 years use a modern method of family planning (DHS, 2014). A significant portion of those displaced are in North Kivu where Save the Children (SC) in collaboration with the ministry of health (MoH), is implementing a family planning (FP) and postabortion care (PAC) project.  Save the Children started the project in 2011 and currently supports 29 MoH health facilities in five health zones and provides free FP and PAC services to internally displaced and host populations.  </p><p></p><p>The MoH brings in health staff from each of the health centers to conduct monthly data review meetings.  Building upon this approach, SC introduced FP PAC project semi-annual or “semester” reviews that include representatives from the provincial health department, health zone staff, community members and Save the Children staff.  During the “semester reviews”, stakeholders analyze monitoring and service data for trends and agree upon action points.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>SC and the MoH are implementing the FP PAC Project in 29 health facilities in the following five health zones in North Kivu: Birambizo, Mweso, Masisi, Nyragongo and Karisimbi.  The intervention package supports the health system through competency-based training, supportive supervision, community mobilization, provision of medical supplies, and engagement of community platforms.  In addition, the project places an emphasis on collecting, analyzing and taking action on data from both routine monitoring and periodic evaluations.  The semester reviews are conducted onsite and include representatives from every level of the health system from the community to the provincial health system.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Save the Children leads the semester reviews that take place in three sites of North Kivu, DRC.  The supported health facilities are a mix of health centers, referral health centers and one hospital.  Each health facility sends the head nurse or doctor, a birth attendant and a community representative and the MoH sends representatives from the provincial and health zone levels.   The reviews take place over one to two days and begin with a review of progress on action items from the previous meeting.  SC staff share results from studies, evaluations and key clinical indicators as well as results from community based activities for the previous six-month period.  The facilitator leads an open discussion regarding trends and reasons for the results.  High performing facilities share strategies they have found successful in reaching their results.  All facilities are able to openly share challenges and successes and learn from each other. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The semester review focuses on a few key indicators, major achievements and areas for improvement.  Data are examined at multiple levels from individual facilities up to the provincial level.  Providers and community members have expressed that engaging in these reviews increases their interest in improving the quality of both service provision and routine data collection and reporting. The meetings seize the opportunity to gain insights from service providers and community members. They also allow for valuable feedback from those closest with clients to discuss what they see as the most significant facilitators and barriers for clients to access services and to provide and receive peer support.  During the most recent review, over 85% of the recommendations from the previous meeting were acted upon. Over time, lessons learned have been incorporated into semester reviews to continuously improve the approach.   </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The semester review allows input from all levels of the project from community and health facility to provincial levels and therefore includes a range of stakeholders and decision makers.  This approach provides an opportunity to celebrate collective achievements and identify root causes for challenges encountered and problem solve solutions.  The broad range of stakeholders is able to analyze, problem solve and identify focal points for priority actions and ensure mutual accountability.  The semester review is an important forum for raising awareness on how FP and PAC services are life saving for women and girls and galvanizes the stakeholders to strengthen outreach and health systems to provide these and other critical reproductive health services. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Adolescents in humanitarian crises are particularly vulnerable to adverse sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. Unpredictability of family networks, personal security, and economic stability during crises can result in neglected focus on the needs of those experiencing one the most fragile stages of human development. An emerging body of literature reveals that child marriage and adolescent pregnancy are heightened in insecure environments. Although the extent and impact of child marriage in humanitarian crises is unknown, the sequelae of negative SRH outcomes related to adolescent pregnancy, including maternal death, in low-income contexts is established.</p><p>With 90% of early first births occurring within marriage, married adolescents are at increased risk for unprotected sex, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancy. Understanding SRH needs of married adolescents is fundamental to risk reduction and prevention of negative health outcomes. Access to youth-friendly SRH services, resources, and education is essential to informed sexual and reproductive choices among adolescents. However, assessment of the ways adolescents access, use, and understand these SRH systems during crisis is limited. Examination of the sexual and reproductive health needs and knowledge of married adolescent refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) is critical to provision of appropriate and comprehensive SRH services.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The broader study aims to estimate the prevalence of child marriage and associated risk factors among refugees in Ethiopia and Lebanon and IDPs in Myanmar. This paper assesses SRH knowledge, outcomes, and service utilization of female adolescent Somali refugees living in Ethiopia, Syrian refugees living in Lebanon and Kachin IDPs living in Myanmar. We aim to improve understanding of married adolescent girls’ experiences navigating SRH in these settings. This analysis explores adolescent beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and outcomes surrounding SRH services, resources, and programs to examine what adolescents know about the resources available to them and how they use those services.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study was conducted in Kobe Refugee Camp, Ethiopia, Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, and three IDP camps in Myanmar. A cross-sectional survey, including a household (HQ) and adolescent questionnaire (AQ), was administered to adult females and girls aged 10-19, respectively. A multi-stage cluster sampling design randomly selected 600 households from 40 clusters within each camp. Eligible households including those that at least one female aged 10-49 living in the household for at least one month of the previous year. Trained interviewers collected data via mobile data collection. The consented adult female completed the HQ, including a household roster. If a girl aged 10-19 was present in the household and the adult female provided parental consent, the assented girl completed the AQ. For sensitivity within Somali and Syrian contexts, SRH knowledge and service awareness questions were only asked to married girls; in Myanmar, these questions were asked to married and unmarried girls. Data collection occurred August-September 2017 in Ethiopia and is ongoing in Lebanon and Myanmar. Exploratory analyses were conducted on key sociodemographic variables and SRH beliefs, knowledge, and outcomes. Multiple logistic regression models (MLRs) were developed to determine probability and correlates of accessing health services and reporting high SRH knowledge.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Data collection is ongoing in Lebanon and Myanmar, including comprehensive measures of SRH knowledge and awareness among married and unmarried girls (Myanmar only), and will be available June 2018. Preliminary results are presented for Somali refugees in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, data were collected from 602 Somali adult females and 311 girls aged 10-19. Among girls aged 10-19, 28 (8.48%) had ever given birth and 55 (17.68%) were married. Nearly three-quarters (72.7%) of married girls reported they had received information about how to become pregnant and 43.6% had ever given birth. Among married girls, contraceptive awareness was low; 60.0% reported that there were ways to prevent or delay pregnancy. More than two-thirds (69.1%) believed that pregnancies experienced too young can harm the woman’s body. Fewer girls (63.6%) were knowledgeable about risks of inadequate birth spacing. Results from four MLRs, which indepdently modeled SRH knowledge outcomes (i.e., knowing pregnancy prevention exists, how to become pregnant, risks of inadequate birth spacing, and a combined measure of these three) indicated that each of these outcomes was highly associated with receipt of information on effects of child marriage (p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study explored reproductive health and service knowledge of adolescent Somali refugees living in Ethiopia. These preliminary results shed light on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian settings and highlight the distinct SRH knowledge and health risks of married girls in crisis zones. Additional analyses and forthcoming data from Lebanon and Myanmar will contribute to our understanding of adolescent SRH needs in humanitarian contexts, especially among married girls. Findings from Ethiopia indicate that exposure to information about effects of child marriage is associated with greater SRH knowledge among married girls. These results may inform adolesecent-focused SRH programs for girls in crises, as educational programs that integrate information about effects and health risks of child marriage and SRH needs prevalent among married girls (e.g., contraception, birth spacing, pregnancy health), may translate to improved SRH knowledge and health outcomes for married adolescents.</p><p>The present study also contributes understanding that, although most married girls know how to become pregnant, fewer are aware of the risks associated with inadequate birth-spacing or the existence of pregnancy prevention methods. Almost half of married girls reported ever giving birth, while only 40% were unaware of ways to avoid pregnancy. In emergency settings, the reproductive health cluster must make information about family planning available to married adolescent girls and ensure that adolescent-friendly services are accessible. Efforts to engage adolescents in SRH programming prior to marriage, at convenient times and locations, should be emphasized to equip young girls and women with the SRH information they need.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Somalia has suffered over two decades of chronic conflict, poverty, and instability. More than 10% of the population is internally displaced and fractured infrastructure has created struggling health and education systems and chronic unemployment. This suffering manifests itself in particularly poor reproductive and child health outcomes. Somalia was named the worst place to be a mother in 2015 with only 9% of women having access to a skilled birth attendant. The maternal mortality ratio and under five mortality rate are among the highest in the world.  Further, there is a great deal of religious and community stigma for RH services, which creates an additional barrier.</p><p>Since 2012, Save the Children (SC), in collaboration with the MOH, has been implementing a program to increase availability and utilization of family planning and postabortion care, including services for the displaced population residing in Puntland. To address poor maternal health outcomes and increase child survival while overcoming substantial barriers of community and religious stigma, three areas were targeted: 1) increasing knowledge and reducing misperceptions surrounding FP and PAC; 2) increasing demand for FP/PAC services by targeting key groups within the community; and 3) advocating for improved FP/PAC services at the MOH level. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>SC’s approach works with community health workers (CHWs) and key influencers at both community and health facility levels.  Monthly discussions with CHWs ensure that necessary information and tools are available to sensitize communities on importance of quality RH services. Women, men, and youth meet quarterly to discuss the importance of FP/PAC services for the health of mothers and children. Radio messages about FP/PAC are aired daily. Champions, both men and women, speak regularly about the positive influence that FP has had on their family. Finally, campaigns are conducted to share positive messaging around FPPAC to a larger audience.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To evaluate the community strategy, triangulation of various data and information source was done to gather lessons and learnings on community approaches and the effect these had on family planning uptake within the program catchment area. Client exit interviews and register reviews are conducted routinely to ensure that services are reaching key demographic groups and clients are satisfied with the care they receive. Routine HMIS data provide higher level quantitative information regarding trends in service provision and demand. In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with key groups to ensure that the messages reaching the community were effective. Finally, process documentation from community meetings, role play activities, and participation in district and national-level conversations were used to evaluate success in moving forward a broader advocacy agenda for family planning and PAC services. This  broad, mixed methods approach drew from community members, youth groups, women’s groups, fathers’ group, health providers, and policy makers from the MOH, and religious and community leaders.</p>",

      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p> The number of FP and PAC clients has risen consistently each quarter since program inception with over 27,000 first-time FP users and 2,800 PAC clients. Religious and community leaders have championed FP and PAC and have worked to ensure community-based solutions to ensure that women are able to reach health facilities in a timely manner to receive FP/PAC services. The integration of FP/PAC messaging into Friday preaching at the juma prayers opened the door for communication between the Imams and MOH. Furthermore, the discussions around the importance of FP/PAC frequently within communities has reduced the stigma that initially existed. Clients are happy with the services that they receive and the quality of counseling and treatment. Continued efforts to tailor services to nulliparous women and adolescents are a high priority as the program moves forward.</p><p>With focused messaging at a community level, knowledge, capacity, and acceptance of FP/PAC services increased over time, reaching 7218 new clients and 9451 clients in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Further, among PAC clients within the same period, 85% of PAC clients, on average, adopt a method of FP before leaving the health facility. It is essential to engage key population groups and influential members of the community through a variety of mechanisms, thus leading larger numbers to embrace the health benefits of FP/PAC. The sense of ownership of FP/PAC services within the community and MOH has led to notable improvements in RH in Puntland, Somalia.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Structural barriers to safe abortion such as high costs, illegality of services, and lack of medical resources are often exacerbated in humanitarian crises. In many contexts, normative barriers further complicate access care. In legally and normatively restrictive environments, women often turn to unsafe procedures to induce abortions. Complications from unsafe abortions account for 7.9% of global maternal mortality, but a significant portion of abortion-related mortality could be prevented through post-abortion care (PAC).</p><p></p><p>Although there is limited empirical evidence regarding the impact of abortion stigma in humanitarian settings, many researchers have hypothesized that fear of social costs may influence women to seek clandestine, unsafe abortion services or delay and/or avoid seeking PAC, leading to thousands of deaths annually. </p><p></p><p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), national abortion law is restrictive and generally interpreted to permit abortion only to save the life of a woman, resulting in limited access to safe abortions at health facilities. In addition to legal and structural barriers, abortion is also highly stigmatized in DRC.  In North and South Kivu, nearly two decades of conflict and instability have weakened the health system, rendering it unable to adequately respond to the significant reproductive health challenges in the region. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Since 2009, CARE, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), and Save the Children, have collaborated with the Reproductive Health Access, Information and Services in Emergencies (RAISE) Initiative at Columbia University to support the Congolese Ministry of Health in providing contraceptive and PAC services in conflict-affected North and South Kivu. RAISE and its partners conducted a program evaluation in 2016-2017 to better understand the barriers and facilitators of access to and use of PAC services. Given the hypothesized link between abortion stigma and negative care-seeking behavior, this paper explores community perceptions of women who induce abortions and their utilization of PAC.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>As part of a larger mixed-methods study conducted with the partners in six health zones of North and South Kivu, we held focus group discussions (FGDs) with community members in 2016 and 2017. Twenty-four FGDs were conducted, four in each of the six rural health zones: six with women aged 18-24 (n=61), six with women aged 25-45 (n=63), six with married men aged 18-29 (n=62), and six with married men aged 30-45 (n=60). </p><p></p><p>All FGDs were conducted by trained Congolese facilitators in local languages and were held in a private room to ensure the confidentiality of the discussion. FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated into French for analysis. The transcripts were read by the research team to identify overarching themes, and a draft codebook created.  Several transcripts were coded separately by two to three researchers using the draft codebooks and the results were discussed to make revisions to the codebooks, adding, deleting or collapsing codes as necessary. Coding was performed in NVivo independently by two to three researchers with a final inter-rater agreement in the 90th percentile range. Finally, the data were interpreted and presented using the respondents’ own words as illustrations.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p></p><p>Community members overwhelmingly confirmed the commonality of induced abortion in their communities, notwithstanding the legally and normatively restrictive environment surrounding pregnancy termination. However, participants indicated that induced abortion is highly stigmatized in their communities, and as such believed that women who induce would face negative consequences such as criminal charges, spousal and familial abandonment, loss of marriage prospects, overt discrimination, and being ostracized by the community. Additionally, many community members believed that fear of stigma and social consequences associated with abortion motivated women who induced in their community to avoid seeking PAC, placing them at an elevated risk for debilitating injuries and death.</p><p></p><p>While initial opinions shared about abortion were extremely negative, community members’ perceptions of women who induced abortions became more nuanced as discussions progressed. Participants acknowledged that it could be acceptable for a woman to terminate a pregnancy for a number of reasons, including health problems, rape, poverty, having an unsupportive partner, having many children and/or close pregnancies, or wanting to continue her studies. Almost all participants indicated that women should have access to PAC following an induced abortion and that health workers must treat these women. Others explained that regardless of the stigma associated with induced abortion, in practice they would not actually ostracize a woman who terminated a pregnancy from their community. Others indicated that they did not believe criminal charges were an appropriate consequence for a woman who induced an abortion and instead favored a conciliatory approach of counselling, conflict resolution, and family planning sensitization.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study contributes to the relative dearth of research investigating the impacts of abortion stigma in humanitarian contexts. Findings from this study indicate that while abortion stigma is widespread in North and South Kivu, attitudes towards women who voluntarily terminate pregnancies are far from one-dimensional.  Rather, community members expressed a diversity of opinions towards women who induce abortion, assigning varying degrees of acceptability depending on the factors motivating a woman to induce. Regardless of the perceived morality of voluntarily terminating a pregnancy, an overwhelming majority of study participants believed that women should have access to PAC. This openness to providing life-saving medical care for women who have induced abortion, in addition to professed acceptability of terminating pregnancies in certain situations indicates that there could indicate an opening to liberalize abortion access in this context.</p><p></p><p>Given DRC’s high maternal mortality, low PAC utilization, and the perceived harmful impact identified by study participants that abortion stigma has upon PAC-seeking behavior, addressing discriminatory beliefs towards women who induce abortions is critical. While expanding legal abortion access under Congolese law is necessary, decriminalizing abortion alone is an insufficient step to address the risks presented by unsafe abortion. Holistic harm reduction efforts must address abortion stigma and engage communities to explore opportunities to shift social norms to be less discriminatory towards women who induce abortion.</p>",

      "title": "Can a high-intensity radio campaign increase uptake of modern contraception? Midline results from a randomised controlled trial in Burkina Faso",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In June 2016, Development Media International (DMI) launched an intensive radio campaign to promote family planning and birth spacing in Burkina Faso. The goal of this campaign was to increase the uptake of modern contraceptive methods. The impact of the campaign has been measured through a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) led by the Jameel Abdul Latif Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).</p><p>This study was the first RCT to evaluate the impact of a mass media campaign on modern contraceptive uptake. The trial’s design was possible because of the unique media environment in Burkina Faso: national radio and television reach less than 20% of women while local radio reaches over 70%. By using local radio only (with limited geographic coverage) an RCT was possible without sacrificing the large audiences essential for impact.</p><p>A midline analysis of our data suggests that our campaign to promote family planning awareness had a significant impact on contraceptive use, specifically on the number of injectables and birth control pills distributed by health clinics. The evidence this campaign is generating will allow governments and funders to determine – definitively – whether mass media is a cost-effective tool in the effort to increase contraceptive use.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study is investigating whether a high-intensity radio campaign can increase the uptake of modern contraceptive methods in Burkina Faso.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The evaluation used a cluster RCT study design. The campaign was broadcast by radio stations in eight randomly selected clusters (from a total of 16) in different regions of Burkina Faso. The impact of the program on the adoption of modern contraceptive methods was measured by comparing contraceptive distribution from clinics within 50km of the intervention radio stations with clinics in eight randomly selected comparable areas with no campaign exposure.</p><p>JPAL used health facility data collected by the Burkinabe Ministry of Health to measure the impact of the intervention, looking at the number of injectables, birth control pills, implants, and male condoms distributed each month.</p><p>We looked at the difference-in-differences between control and intervention clusters to analyse the midline results. This allowed us to compare intervention and controls while taking into account time-series trends in the month and years before the launch of the program.</p><p>The impact of the program will also be measured using survey data from 7,500 women. A baseline panel survey was conducted in early 2016 and a follow-up survey is planned for late 2018. The survey will measure the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) as well as knowledge and behavioural indicators.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We currently have quarterly aggregate data from 839 clinics and health centres (433 in intervention areas and 406 in the control areas) for the period of April 2015 to September 2017. These data show that the campaign had a significant impact on the number of injectables and birth control pills distributed. On average, clinics that were located in the treatment areas each month delivered 3.3 more injectables (p=0.07) and 3.1 more packets of pills (for a month of contraception) (p=0.05) than in control areas. This corresponds to statistically significant increases of 14% and 22% respectively.  The measured impact on implant distribution was small and positive while the measured impact on male condom distribution was large and positive, but neither was statistically significant.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorous evaluation of a mass media family planning campaign to date, and will generate evidence that benefits both policymakers and funders when selecting cost-effective demand-side interventions.</p><p>In early 2019, we will have a complete set of time series data from the Ministry of Health on contraceptive distribution as well as survey data on mCPR, knowledge, and intentions. In addition, we will be able to cross-validate this data with the qualitative research regularly collected by our in-country research team as well as our monthly listenership surveys measuring exposure. JPAL will also conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the campaign.</p><p>This evaluation represents one of the most comprehensive studies available to inform policy makers about the impact of mass media on increasing demand for family planning methods. It comes at a crucial time for the sector, as partners are working towards their FP2020 targets. For example, Burkina Faso highlights an increase in the demand for contraceptives as a key priority in its <em>Plan National d’Accélération de Planification Familiale du Burkina Faso 2017-2020</em>. By 2020, the government needs to increase the number of contraceptive users in the country by 36%, from 960,000 to 1.3 million. Our study will allow the government to estimate the contribution that a national radio campaign could make on reaching these targets.</p>",

      "title": "Challenges and opportunities in evaluating human centered design work for behavior change in adolescent sexual and reproductive health: lessons learnt from the evaluation of Adolescents 360",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Adolescents 360 (A360) is a 4.5 year, US$30 million initiative which aims to increase the voluntary use of modern contraceptives and reduce unplanned pregnancy among girls aged 15 to 19 years in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania. The innovative A360 approach to adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) is led by human-centered design (HCD) and combined with social marketing, developmental neuroscience, public health, sociocultural anthropology and youth engagement ‘lenses’ and aims to create context-specific, youth-driven solutions that respond to the needs of young people.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Two years into the evaluation process, we reflect on the following question: Does measuring the application and impact of this novel HCD-led design approach present any evaluation opportunities or challenges?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The A360 external evaluation design includes a Process Evaluation (PE), a quasi-experimental Outcome Evaluation (OE), a Cost-Effectiveness Study (CES) and an Engagement and Research Uptake (ERU) Strategy. The evaluation aims to understand whether the A360 approach leads to better reproductive health outcomes; generate evidence about A360’s cost-effectiveness in relation to other programming approaches; and capture how A360 is implemented in different contexts, and the experience of the participating young people and communities. The PE and CES commenced in 2016 in line with the intervention design process, and activities are being conducted across the entire A360 geographies. Baseline outcome evaluation cross-sectional surveys in four settings in the three target countries were conducted in 2017, and will be conducted again approximately 24 months after scale-up, in late 2019.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The HCD-led design process posed challenges in evaluation design and implementation for all three main components. For the PE, methodologies, such as participant observations, are key to capturing the depth of the fast-paced, highly-iterative HCD process, which are often undocumented. This requires a flexible evaluation team, who can align closely with the workplan of the implementers.  Equally, evaluators need to balance the importance of capturing the views of community members with the potential for research fatigue through participation in both the HCD process and evaluation. The iterative HCD process meant that key pieces of information about the interventions - such as intervention components, settings, recipients, and eligible populations - were unclear and changed over the course of OE protocol development. This led to the examination of many study design scenarios, and a study design that was finalized before the interventions themselves were finalized. Like for the OE, uncertainty in intervention characteristics complicated and delayed development of CES protocols. Because HCD activities of the design process were tightly intertwined with the other A360 lenses, it was difficult to isolate the cost of HCD specifically. Finally, as a new approach for the implementers, it was challenging to separate one-off “learning” costs versus those “replication” costs that a program would incur implementing the A360 approach elsewhere.</p><p>Opportunities for the implementers and evaluators of interventions developed through HCD-led processes include the ability to inform and improve programmatic decision-making in real-time to ensure that interventions adequately meet the contextualized needs in the targeted areas.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Robust evaluation of a new and promising approach such as HCD is warranted, yet challenging. Although the qualitative methods of PE are vital to understanding the unfolding of the HCD process, PE design should take into account the iterative nature of HCD and ensure that the PE activites are seen as complementary to, and not part of HCD from the community perspective. Those implementing HCD should allocate adequate time to participate in the evaluation. Uncertainty in key pieces of information on the intervention and its implementation led to a more time-consuming and resource-intensive design process for the OE and CES. Future HCD-based initiatives should consider a phased evaluation approach, leading with a PE and waiting until the program details are finalized (e.g. following pilot study) before planning an outcome evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. This needs to be balanced against the impact this approach may have on lengthening the time between implementation and evaluation.</p>",

      "title": "Evidence-based social marketing in Afghanistan and Nepal: Using data to improve efficiency and effectiveness",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Demand is high among donors and implementers for “use of data for decision making,” “evidence-based programming,” and “adaptive management” to improve effectiveness and efficiency of family planning interventions. However, a recent review of U.S. foreign assistance program evaluations found that utilization of evaluation findings is low (MFAN and the Lugar Center 2018). For example, the review found that only 10% of USAID evaluations included who is responsible for acting on evaluation findings and recommendations. Connecting monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) data to improvements in program implementation remains a challenge, given a lack of opportunity for program managers to participate in M&amp;E and a lack of user-friendliness in presentation of M&amp;E findings. The USAID -funded Sustaining Health Programs through the Private Sector (SHOPS) Plus project provides technical assistance to two social marketing organizations: the Afghanistan Social Marketing Organization (ASMO) and Nepal Contraceptive Retail Supply Company (CRS). SHOPS Plus works with both ASMO and CRS to strengthen their use of evidence in contraceptive marketing and distribution strategies.  This presentation will discuss how SHOPS Plus, ASMO, and CRS are successfully using M&amp;E data to make programmatic decisions, bridging the gap between implementation and M&amp;E in social marketing of contraceptives.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Two surveys conducted for program monitoring, one in Nepal and one in Afghanistan, sought to answer the following questions related to oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, and condoms:</p><ul>\t<li>Is availability of these products sufficient in the private sector for ASMO and CRS brands as well as other commercial brands?</li>\t<li>Are these products and related promotional materials visible in private sector outlets, signaling availability of ASMO and CRS brands as well as other commercial brands?</li>\t<li>Are outlets adhering to recommended prices for CRS and ASMO brands of these products?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>SHOPS Plus conducts annual surveys of contraceptive availability, visibility, and price on in Nepal and Afghanistan. Both surveys use lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) to select 19 enumeration areas from each of ASMO and CRS’ six supervision areas and generate estimates of whether each supervision area meets pre-defined standards for contraceptive availability, visibility, and price. In both countries, surveys collect data from pharmacies, grocery stores, general stores, and other private retailers on contraceptive stock, product and promotional material visibility, and retail prices. To measure contraceptive availability in the private sector, surveys collect data on all brands of condoms, oral contraceptives, and injectable contraceptives, including CRS and ASMO brands.</p><p>In Afghanistan, the first survey was conducted in April 2017 and included 1,182 retail outlets from 109 randomly sampled enumeration areas (district market centers) from the 177 districts where ASMO works. The second survey is in progress and will be completed by July 2018.</p><p>In Nepal, the first survey was conducted in December 2017 and included 674 retail outlets in 114 enumeration areas (wards) randomly selected from 49 rural districts where CRS works. The second survey is planned for December 2018.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The Afghanistan survey found that while ASMO’s products are a key contributor nationally to availability of condoms, oral contraceptives, and injectable contraceptives, stock outs are frequent. ASMO could increase overall contraceptive availability if product supplies were consistent. Many outlets were also selling oral and injectable contraceptives at prices above those recommended by ASMO.</p><p>In Nepal, availability of oral and injectable contraceptives (CRS and other brands) was limited by the lack of pharmacies in rural districts, as only pharmacies can sell these products. Though condoms can be carried in all types of retail outlets, many grocery and general stores do not stock condoms because owners believe that condoms will not sell or are not appropriate for their shop.</p><p>ASMO and CRS staff met, respectively, to interpret results and create action plans for modifying contraceptive marketing and distribution plans in response to findings. Key elements of ASMO’s action plan include redesigning its procurement system to prevent stockouts, redistributing staff and funding to lower performing supervision areas, working with industry associations (i.e. the pharmacy association) to recruit new sellers in areas with low availability, and distributing more promotional materials. ASMO also decided to raise the prices of oral and injectable contraceptives, to increase their revenue and improve cost recovery.</p><p>Key elements of CRS’ action plan include piloting community-based product distribution strategies in remote areas with few pharmacies, training CRS staff to convince grocery and general stores to stock condoms, and distributing more promotional materials to encourage consumers to ask for contraceptives.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Use of M&amp;E data to inform social marketing interventions for family planning enables implementers to direct their resources to geographic areas with low contraceptive availability or to specific contraceptive products that are less accessible. The second rounds of each survey will assess whether these steps have contributed to improvements in availability, visibility, and price of condoms, oral contraceptives, and injectable contraceptives. This presentation will share specific examples and processes to illustrate how two social marketing organizations have used M&amp;E data to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their contraceptive marketing and distribution. Their use of data required collaboration between researchers and implementers to design surveys, interpret findings, and formulate action plans in response to findings. These efforts also required shifts in organizational culture so that researchers and program staff could collaborate more effectively at all stages of data collection, analysis, and use. These examples from Nepal and Afghanistan can inform efforts to use data to improve social marketing of contraceptives and other types of family planning interventions globally.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>According to the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey 2017, Uganda has a modern contraceptive prevalence rate of 33.9% and an unmet need for family planning of 29.6%. Unsubstantiated fears, stigma and myths are still keeping many women away from family planning services, and they may forgo contraception altogether.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Marie Stopes Uganda is currently pilot-testing a community mobilization strategy that involves the use of giant puppets in community drives to increasing knowledge, awareness and demand for contraception and clarification on Family Planning myths for example the fact that FP causes cancer and infertility. This is a form of edutainment that uses puppetry, or puppet theatre, alongside mobile music vans for community mobilization. These larger-than-life caricatures stand out of the crowd and attract people irrespective of age, social status, religious beliefs or political affiliation. These puppets are ten feet tall, with enormous heads. Their size helps to draw crowds.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The puppet shows have been conducted in 12 districts and have proved to be an effective tool for gathering crowds, with many women even leaving their stalls in the markets to come and watch the show which are usually conducted around markets. The two puppets, who represent mother and father figures, entertain an audience, usually of around 150 people, for three to four minutes while a master of ceremonies provides an amusing but educational commentary on FP. At the end of the show the Marie Stopes Uganda team swoops into action to raise awareness about the benefits of family planning and where to access services. It is a fun and engaging way to discuss family planning. We looked at data on Marie Stopes Uganda services over time in several districts to see whether performances of the puppet theatre coincided with increases in service utilization and revenue.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In Mbarara in western Uganda and Gulu and Lira in northern Uganda during the community drive with puppets, Marie Stopes centres increased their monthly number of FP clients by 50% in just three days, as well as 60% increases in income. There was also an increase in new clients and helpline calls in the same period. In Kabale district in the western region of Uganda, the centre achieved its entire monthly projection for family planning clients in the three days during which the puppet drive was held. The Marie Stopes centre data capture system and dash boards further indicate that centres have provided the most FP services in the months when the community drive with puppets was held in their districts.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Innovative social and behaviour change approaches need to be used to revitalize the discussion on family planning. Strategies that Marie Stopes Uganda and other organizations have utilized in the past for community mobilization include mobile vans with loudspeakers on top, but these have become monotonous and hardly capture people’s attention anymore.</p><p>The puppetry drive has proved to be an effective tool for gathering crowds and mobilizing the community. It provides a great opportunity to talk to the audience about family planning and other sexual and reproductive health issues of concern. The giant puppets create an environment that allows people and Marie Stopes Uganda representatives to discuss family planning in a friendly, fun and engaging way. This, in turn, impels people to seek further services or to seek services for the first time.</p>",

      "title": "Innovations in behavior change for adolescents and youth in Niger",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>As in many other parts of the developing world, adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health (AYSRH) programming is a priority in Niger. From 2014-2016, the Pathfinder International (PI)-led Evidence to Action project (E2A) implemented the University Leadership for Change (ULC) program to: (i) strengthen youth capacity to lead behavior change (BC) activities; (ii) strengthen provider capacity to respond to AYSRH needs; (iii) create a program management structure that brought together stakeholders from student and provider populations as well as relevant government ministries. A key innovation was the use of <em>Pathways to Change</em>, a simple board game that introduced small groups of university students—led by youth leaders—to key ideas about AYSRH-related BC in a meaningful and engaging way. Careful monitoring of <em>Pathways to Change</em> produced a second significant innovation: the ULC Database and Dashboard (UDD). The UDD captures young peoples’ perceptions of how they themselves understand the challenges they face when trying to adopt safer AYSRH behaviors. The UDD data complements limited behavioral surveillance data available. Together, <em>Pathways to Change</em> and UDD present the insights of young people in a readily useable form to advance youth leadership and guide programmatic decision-making.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>ULC used a comprehensive BC approach that had three primary components: (i) Capacitation of student leaders to increase knowledge and discuss attitudes and behaviors about AYSRH as well as to develop facilitator skills in the use of BC techniques including <em>Pathways to Change</em>; (ii) refresher training to service providers who frequently serve the needs of students and youth; and (iii)  development of a co-management committee (CMC) that joins student leaders, service providers, and representatives of the Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Education. The program was managed locally by staff from PI in collaboration with others in the CMC.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>ULC began in Niamey, but subsequently expanded to three additional universities in three different regions.  Student leaders recorded the barriers and facilitators identified by small groups of university and community peers (8,000 in total) as part of over 400 <em>Pathways to Change</em> game; these outputs were submitted to a team of supervisors trained in coding using a behavioral typology. Using this typology, project managers entered data into the UDD according to behavioral objective (e.g., seeking contraception, spacing pregnancies, etc.), sex and age cohorts of the participants, and region in Niger.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Use of <em>Pathways to Change</em> and the UDD revealed several interesting perceptions on AYSRH behavior change depending on respondents’ sex, age, and location. Some of the findings were consistent with what was already known about the situation of youth (e.g., peers seem to be bigger barriers and facilitators of change to AYSRH than either providers or parents), but others offered some new insights. For instance:</p><ul>\t<li>Service providers were generally seen—by both young women and men—as more supportive and facilitative (or conversely, less of a barrier to service access) and providing a higher quality of service in secondary cities rather than in the capital of Niamey.</li>\t<li>Younger women were more likely than older women to seek peer support when looking for services related to HIV or other STIs, but both groups sought similar levels of support to look for services related to contraception.</li></ul><p>Using orthogonal contrasts, comparisons show interesting differences among groups in different demographic profiles; importantly, however, it is critical to acknowledge the very qualitative nature of this information. The barriers and facilitators were provided by small groups rather than individually, they were identified in reference to a “fictional” individual that shared the group’s demographics rather than directly about the participants. Also, the UDD is set up to flag barriers and facilitators identified for 10 predetermined behavioral objectives based on ULC’s AYSRH focus. Still, the UDD offers a unique approach to articulating young people’s own perceptions of barriers and facilitators of change.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>There is a tendency to overlook the heterogeneity of young people and assume that adolescents and young people perceive and experience barriers in a homogenous way, thus limiting the results of AYSRH programming. There are many other ways in which the UDD provides novel means to use the information it contains, and inject the heterogeneity of the population in programs. For instance, structured exploration of the database can assist in the:</p><p></p>\t<li>Development of behaviorally sound and evidence-informed scripts and other narratives that can be broadcast over radio, using videos or in community theater;</li>\t<li>Identification of informational gaps or misunderstanding that can be used to develop IEC materials;</li>\t<li>Assessment of the behavioral “climate” that will be encountered when doing AYSRH work in different parts of a catchment area in anticipation of intervention adaptations.</li>\t<li>Use of other segmentation and surveillance research to develop better targeted activities and recognize that some programmatic activities (e.g., those targeting stigma reduction in this case) may not be as needed as others.</li>\t<li>As a resource for peer educators to stimulate conversations and debate using an evidence-base of perceived barriers and facilitators of behavior change.</li><p></p><p>The UDD provides a context-sensitive data base, inclusive of youth perceptions on which to ground and guide AYSRH-related behavior change activities in Niger. It allows these types of activities to be implemented within youth’s own frames of reference, which is critical.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Examination of whether family planning programs sustain beyond the program cycle is important for designing programs that are embedded into the existing system.  The Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative program was launced in 2010 and had important effects in the initial five year period. In 2015, program activities were stopped in one city and continued in another. This paper examines whether family planning program activities sustain at facilities post-program implemention in two sites: a setting where the family planning program continued (Kaduna) and  a setting where the family planning program ceased in 2015 (Ilorin). Perspectives from providers  and facility administrators from health facilities where the program activities sustained compared to providers in health facilities where the program did not sustain (in the city where the program ceased) are used to inform design of programs that continue beyond the funding cycle. Information from government stakeholders in both sites are used to determine how government commitment is related to longer term program sustainability.  </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What facilitates program activities sustaining in some service delivery sites and not in others?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In June, 2018, in-depth interviews with a hospital administrator and a family planning provider in each of ten facilities (5 that sustained and 5 that did not) in Ilorin (the city where the program ended) were undertaken to determine some of the levers that support sustained programming.  Questions were asked about what factors were in place to support family planning service provision and what barriers were encountered.  We explore areas related to: funding for family planning; administrative support for family planning; supply of family planning methods; commitments to family planning training and activities; and the role of family planning champions.  Data are being analyzed using ATLAS.ti to permit collaborative coding across partners. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Analyses are under way but we expect that facilities that sustained will have champions that made family planning their priority issue. These champions may be at the level of the Local Government Area, at the municipality level, or at the specific facility level. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Understanding the levers of sustained programming post program funding is crucial for designing programs for scale-up and sustainability for the long term. Findings from this study can be used by NURHI 2 to inform their new activities in facilities to strengthen the family planning service environment. Findings will also be generalized beyond NURHI and family planning programming to inform other facility-based programs seeking to develop sustained improvements in health care services. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Though Nepal has experienced gains in contraceptive prevalence, in the recent decade key family planning (FP) indicators have stagnated. Research on FP use in Nepal has identified inequitable access to  reproductive health (RH) services as a key barrier for contraceptive use for many communities in Nepal. Specifically, hard-to-reach (HTR) communities such as Dalit, Janajati, and Muslims are routinely missed for SRH due to stigma and biases associated with contraceptive use. Talking about reproductive health is taboo in Nepal, and the traditional norms that limit those conversations also directly influence many reproductive health decisions, such as: limiting access to RH information for young people, pressuring newly married couples to have children, and perpetuating the myth that women are responsible for not “producing sons”. Traditional norms also reinforce men’s dominance over reproductive health decisions, even despite their unwillingness to invest time or engage in conversation with their wives on these topics. And indeed, their wives do not expect them to. Given recognition that related social norms are a barrier to increasing FP use, Nepali policy makers are turning their attention to interventions that have the potential to address social and gender norms and hard to reach (HTR) communities. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Research and community validation processes identified games as an appropriate platform for sharing accurate information about FP; increasing individual fertility awareness and knowledge about menstruation; and combatting negative social norms.  A package of nine games, collectively called Pragati, tackle these topics with interactive games built on best practices from adult learning and normative change interventions. The games provide accurate information about reproductive health for players. Pragati was integrated into the activities of community change advocates. Over time, excitement around the games increased and dissemination expanded to new platforms including schools, women’s collectives, and agricultural and saving groups. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A proof of concept phase facilitated the trial of each game in every district and informed the refinement process prior to initial implementation in January, 2017. The Pragati games were then rolled out in a stepwise manner in five Nepali districts over 15 months. Originally, the primary beneficiaries were adolescent women (15-25 years old) in HTR communities. During the introduction phase, community feedback reflected the importance of expanding the beneficiaries to include men, and extended families when possible. Game implementation ended in March, 2018.  </p><p> </p><p>The Pragati project evaluation is utilizing a mixed methods quasi-experimental design. Data collection for this three-arm evaluation is currently underway. A structured questionnaire is being administered to a systematically selected representative sample of 3,645 women and men 18 – 39 years old across all districts. Focus group discussions and in-depth interview data will contextualize individual experiences associated with game play and resulting behaviors. Evaluation results will be triangulated with monitoring data and HMIS findings.</p><p> </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Field reports and feedback from local stakeholders suggest that the games were well received by the communities and facilitated public discussion of traditionally taboo topics including reproductive health and family planning. Anecdotal information suggests that conversations between spouses and even with mixed-sex groups were occurring. Approximately 5,344 games were played in the target communities with a total of 75,027 points of contact in 30 Village Development Committees. Two-thirds of the contacts were women and HTR communities actively participated in the games, particularly those that introduced topics such as fertility awareness and address social norms. </p><p> </p><p>The most popular games were the Menstrual Cycle Game and the Son/Daughter Game. Program reports suggest that men, in particular, appreciated learning new information about the menstrual cycle and fertile window. Following the Son-Daughter game, men and women discussed the impact of son-preference on women, which was balanced with accurate information about men’s roles in sex determination. Although male champions successfully facilitated men’s game playing, the volume of female promoters far exceeded the number of male champions. This intervention design was based primarily on the reality that male migration has resulted in the absence of many men of reproductive age in Nepali communities. As the games were disseminated through other platforms, younger males were brought into the game play. Final results detailing changes in fertility awareness, social norms, and practices surrounding FP with associated figures will be presented. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Despite common perceptions, men, women, and youth alike are interested in learning about fertility and FP. Discussing these taboo topics through the participatory format of the Pragati games delivers information in a sensible manner, engages participants in learning about their bodies, and helps dispel misconceptions about FP. A key component of the games which is also a challenging piece, is the facilitation of critical reflection which is essential to help participants connect the game content to their own lives and desires. This was particularly challenging for low-literacy promoters with the social and gender norms-focused games, as they themselves may have the same attitudes and biases that are being re-examined. Adequate training and coaching support for low-literate promoters is required to implement the games properly. Nevertheless, literate facilitators, such as secondary school teachers, are able to lead the games and critical discussions with basic training in the games.</p><p></p><p>Program experience showed that integration of the games into health and non-health programs with literate community facilitators is feasible and mutually beneficial for programs that seek to either improve FP uptake or address social norms related to gender and reproductive health issues, such as gender-based violence, early marriage, and son preference. The practice of community game playing offers a viable solution for interventions that aim to promote fertility awareness and increase discussion around social norms in order to improve family planning use.</p>",

      "title": "A  qualitative examination of the pathway to medical abortion for women in Laos",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Laos has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios of Southeast Asia, with current estimates at 206 deaths per 100,000 live births. According to recently published estimates, there are more than 5 million abortions annually in Southeast Asia and 40% of these are classified as either less-safe or least-safe. Up until 2016, abortion in Laos was restricted except to save the life of a pregnant woman or on economic grounds, which required the approval of a community village chief.  In June 2016, the Lao government approved new National Guidelines to Prevent Unsafe Abortion, which included the right to safe abortion for any indication.</p><p>There is little published evidence on Lao women’s abortion experience. In order to identify how to best inform women of this change in legal status of abortion services, it was necessary to gather data on the Lao abortion knowledge environment, including both barriers and facilitators along the pathway to care for women seeking safe abortion services.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This qualitative study sought to understand the pathway to abortion for Lao women, including their experience with contraception (pre- and post-abortion), the circumstance surrounding an unintended pregnancy, the abortion decision-making experience, access to abortion services and actions taken to end a pregnancy.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted between February/ March 2017 with women, 25 to 35 years old, who reported having an abortion during the past 24 months. Criteria for inclusion included: being a woman of reproductive age (18-49 years old), having had an induced abortion within the last 24 months (self-induced or provider induced), and currently living in either the Vientiane Capital or Champasack Province. A semi-structured in-depth interview guide was developed in English and then translated into Lao by the local research team. A deductive thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the data in Dedoose, a web-based platform for qualitative data analysis.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The study found that although women report access to abortion services and products in their communities, these services are often regarded by women as illegal, and so should not be discussed outside of the community. Because of this stigma, most of their information about safe abortion, including where to obtain one, was limited to those people within a woman’s immediate network. Seven out of the twelve women interviewed reported taking pills to induce an abortion; the remaining five women used MVA. Most women expressed misconceptions about the safety and effectiveness of medical abortion (MA) pills, couldn’t identify a brand, and had widely varying knowledge of how to take medical abortion pills. Quality control of misoprostol and MA at pharmacies in Laos was identified as inconsistent, as many women reported taking “Chinese pills” and the exact ingredients and quality of these medicines are unknown. </p><p>Low uptake of post-abortion family planning (PAFP) was reported by women in the study, despite a feeling by many women that they wished they had been using contraception prior to their unintended pregnancy.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These qualitative results contain several important considerations for improving medical abortion access and knowledge in Lao communities. Taking pills to induce an abortion was considered  by the women interviewed to be a less safe method and many women were preoccupied with the concern that there would not be complete expulsion. Given the prevalence of MA use as an abortion method, high-quality pharmacist training on MA administration, when to seek follow-up care and PAFP counseling is needed. Community campaigns aimed at dispelling myths and misconceptions about MA are also needed, as many women reported getting information on abortion methods from family member or friends in their community.</p>",

      "title": "Abortion Incidence and Safety in Nigeria: Findings from a Population-Based Survey",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Nigeria, abortion is only legal to save a woman’s life. Recent estimates extrapolated from facility-based abortion complication data indicate that there were approximately 33 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49 in 2012 (Bankole et al. 2015). This is equivalent to 1.25 million abortions annually, representing more than half (56%) of all unintended pregnancies to Nigerian women. According to the prior dichotomous categorization of abortion safety at the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly all of these abortions would be considered unsafe (Sedgh et al. 2012; Ganatra et al. 2017; World Health Organization 1993), resulting in nearly 500,000 women experiencing serious health consequences and less than half  (212,000) receiving treatment for these complications (Bankole et al. 2015).</p><p>The WHO has moved towards a more nuanced categorization of abortion safety in recent years, operationalizing a three-category measure of safety – safe, less, safe, and least safe (Ganatra et al. 2017). This conceptualization better accounts for the increasing availability of medication abortion drugs like misoprostol in many legally restrictive settings. This allows for distinction between abortions that are most likely to result in maternal mortality and morbidity and abortions that are relatively safe but not performed as per medical guidelines.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The primary objective of this study is to estimate the one-year incidence of induced abortion in Nigeria overall and by women’s characteristics using direct and indirect methodologies. The secondary objective is to determine women’s pathways to abortion care in order to assess the safety of reported abortions and identify the women who are most likely to experience the least safe abortions.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this study come from a population-based survey of reproductive age women (15-49) conducted by Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020), Nigeria. We employed a two-stage cluster sampling deign using probability proportional to size sampling across seven states, producing a nationally representative sample. The female questionnaire contains family planning and abortion questions. The abortion module includes questions on the respondent’s closest confidante and their experiences with pregnancy removal when pregnant and period regulation at a time when worried that might be pregnant (asked separately), followed by questions on the respondent’s experiences with these. Data collection occurred from April through May, 2018. The final sample included 11,106 women.</p><p>For the analyses, we first examined the respondent characteristics, as well as the limited demographic characteristics of the confidantes. We also made assumptions regarding the confidante living in a similar residence (urban/rural) and state as the respondent. We calculated one-year incidences of induced abortion using responses from the questions on pregnancy removal and period regulation, separately and in combination, for the respondent and confidante overall and by age, education, and residence. We then examined details of the reported method(s) of abortion, categorizing each as safe, less safe, or least safe.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "A total of 11,106 women of reproductive age completed the female survey. Respondents reported on average 0.8 close confidantes, and provided demographic and abortion experience details for 5,883 of their closest confidantes. Confidantes were slightly younger and more educated than respondents. Overall, the one-year pregnancy removal incidence for respondents was 19.5 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49 while the period regulation incidence was 24.8 per 1,000. The one-year pregnancy removal and period regulation incidences for confidantes were 38.4 and 33.3, respectively. The one-year “likely abortion” incidence (pregnancy removal and period regulation combined) for respondents was 41.1 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49 while the confidante incidence was 62.5. The respondent and confidante incidences revealed similar trends, with women in their 20s, women with secondary or higher education, and women in urban areas being the most likely to have had an abortion in the prior year.Examining abortion safety, 28.2% of respondents’ likely abortions were safe while only 20.6% of confidantes’ likely abortions were safe. A minority of respondent and confidante abortions were less safe (6.3% and 8.2%, respectively), thus the majority of abortions were least safe (65.6% and 71.3%, respectively). Exploring percentage of abortions that were least safe by characteristics reveals similar patterns for confidantes and respondents. Among both groups, the women most likely to have the least safe abortions were the youngest, women with no education, and women residing in rural areas.",
      "knowledgeContribution": "Results from this study provide new insights regarding the frequency, correlates, and conditions under which women have abortions in Nigeria. Regardless of whether examining respondent or confidante data, findings indicate that abortion in this setting is common and more likely to occur among young, urban, and educated women. Additionally, the majority of abortions are least safe, with younger, poorer, and less educated women at greatest risk of having least safe abortions. Findings highlight the presence of significant social disparities in the conditions under which abortions are performed, leaving poor, rural, and less educated women at greatest risk of abortion-related morbidity and mortality. Thus, evidence from this study confirms that abortion in Nigeria is not only a public health concern, but an issue of social inequities.",

      "title": "Raising awareness of one legal indications for abortion in a conservative setting: assessing Mexico’s National Pro-Choice Alliance communications campaign",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>It is estimated that every 16 minutes a person is raped in Mexico (SNSP, 2017). While abortion laws are determined at the state level in Mexico, rape is a legal ground for abortion across all 32 states. Also, since 2016, women’s sworn statement on the issue is enough to request the abortion service at public health institutions. However, lack of knowledge of abortion legislation amidst a highly conservative setting constitutes a fundamental access barrier to safe abortion services. In 2017, the National Pro-Choice Alliance for Mexico (Anda<em>r</em>; formed by five national and international NGOs) designed, tested and implemented a campaign in six state capitals on this issue. The evaluation of this campaign contributes to an information gap in the region on what works and what does not work in abortion communication efforts. The assessment of whether this campaign was effective in increasing knowledge of the legal indication of rape among women is not only pivotal to advocacy work that promotes access to safe abortion practices in the country, but it also shows the complexities of balancing out communication and methodological priorities to maintain rigor in both campaign and evaluation efforts.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Anda<em>r</em>’s campaign “Puedes Elegir un Aborto Legal” targeted women of reproductive age (18-49) from middle and low socioeconomic strata. It was implemented in six state capitals, mostly in the center region of the country. The campaign invited women to contact Anda<em>r</em> via various channels, including a hotline. A 3-month campaign was carried out employing posters, painted street-walls, buses and promotional materials as well as interpersonal community-based outreach activities. The evaluation of the focused on this street-level component. An online strategy was also conducted for almost a year, but it was monitored and not formally evaluated.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study aimed to evaluate the campaign’s effect on women’s knowledge of the legality of abortion under the indication of rape in the campaign sites. All 6 cities, except for one in the south-east of the country, are situated in the central region of Mexico. The campaign ran in six urban neighborhoods selected in each state capital: 3 with a medium level of marginalization (a proxy for identifying low-middle class neighborhoods) and 3 with a low level of marginalization (a proxy for identifying middle class neighborhoods). A face-to-face baseline survey was conducted in February 2017 (one month prior to campaign launching) and an endline survey was conducted in July 2017 (one month after the campaign concluded). We used a street-intercept methodology in areas of high pedestrian traffic within the selected neighborhoods. Due to budgetary restrictions, a representative sample could not be reached in each campaign-site, but we surveyed 390 women aged 18-49 in each capital city per survey round. Measured outcomes included: a) women’s knowledge of the rape indication for abortion; b) exposure to pro-choice campaign messaging; and c) changes in the number of requests for information offered by the Anda<em>r</em>.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results showed that the campaign significantly increased knowledge of the legality of the rape indication for abortion among the target population across all sites (46% pre- vs. 56.3% post). Analysis was performed on socio-demographic variables, showing that knowledge also significantly increased among women who were married/living in common law (44% pre- vs. 57% post). However, results were heterogeneous at the state level, with only two states showing a significant increase in knowledge on the issue. Furthermore, although the overall increase in recall of pro-choice messaging on abortion was not significant, results show a significant increase in the proportion of women who reported having seen information on abortion, as well as a significant decrease in recall of anti-abortion or “pro-life” messaging. Similarly, although the proportion of respondents was insufficient for statistical tests on the media materials better recalled by women, results suggest that street-walls, poster and flyers may be effective means of communication for this issue. Also, Anda<em>r</em>’s internal reports recorded a higher number of information requests on abortion in 2017 compared to 2016, when no specific Alliance campaign was in place: information requests from women who saw the campaign, represented almost half of the total requests of information registered. Finally, the campaign’s publications on the fanpage on Facebook reached 9, 152, 162 unique users from March through December 2017, and obtained 12,278 followers. The website registered 14,522 sessions of unique users in the same period; 70% of these sessions were located/originated in the campaign’s states.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The evaluation of the “Puedes Elegir” campaign contributes to promote evidence-based advocacy work, particularly on abortion rights. Given the insufficient availability of evidence on communication efforts on abortion in the academic literature in the Latin American region, we hope to contribute to reginal efforts to address this stigmatized issue in conservative contexts. The evaluation efforts could also be improved by including a control group, using assisted recall to confirm campaign exposure, documenting the existence of messaging on the same issue during the campaign period and other context variables for which statistical analysis should correct. Although the evaluation design has limitations, the study findings show there is a significant correlation between the respondents’ 10% increase in knowledge about the legal indication of rape for abortion in the selected sites, and the campaign’s communication efforts. The reasons behind the heterogeneity of results may be the cultural and political differences in campaign locations, which may suggest the heightened effectiveness of customized campaigns for local settings. Campaign organizers should also consider how to respond to a possible increase in the demand for legal abortion services in contexts where access is restricted. Working as an Alliance has been fruitful in this regard as it linked potential providers with advocacy groups. Finally, online campaigning may reach a larger population and improve targeted messaging, but researchers will have to find innovate and ethical ways to measure knowledge, attitudinal, and/or behavioral change among net surfers.</p>",

      "title": "Understanding the Causes, Practices, and Consequences of Terminating Pregnancies: Experiences of Women Incarcerated for Illegal Abortion in Rwanda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Despite ratifying the Maputo Protocol in 2010, the Rwandan Penal Code solely permits abortion under four conditions: rape, incest, forced marriage, and maternal and “unborn babies” endangerment. Exemption from criminal charges under these cases only stands if women obtain a court order and retrieve consent by two physicians. Since there is only one doctor for every 15,806 people in Rwanda (National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, 2014), legal abortion under any of the sanctioned circumstances remains rare.</p><p>However, an estimated 60,000 induced abortions were performed in Rwanda between 2009 and 2010, most of which occurred in Kigali (Guttmacher, 2012). Approximately half of all these abortions were performed by untrained individuals: 34% by traditional healers and 17% were self-induced through washing detergents, glycerine, and herbs. Consequently, 24,000 women (40%) required emergency treatment for medical complications, but 30% of women failed to receive treatment due to fear of arrest (Guttmacher Institute, 2012). Since approximately 24% of all incarcerated women in Rwanda were convicted for obtaining abortions, face sentences of one to three years and a fine of $300 USD (Guttmacher Institute, 2012), Health Development Initiative (HDI) recognized the need to learn more about women convicted of terminating their pregnancies.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This research study seeks to explore the causes and risk factors, practices, as well as consequences of women imprisoned for terminating their pregnancies in Rwanda. The secondary objective is to document stories and incidences of unsafe abortion that claim many women’s lives. Results of the study will be used to inform advocacy efforts for increased access to safe abortion services and to contribute to the development of national policies and guidelines.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>From August 2017 to March 2018, HDI conducted a qualitative case control study where women, aged 15 to 45, who were convicted of abortion were eligible for participation. Women were selected for charges both before and after the penal code of 2012 which specified the four exemptions to abortion eligibility. The study occurred among four prisons: Nyagatare Juvenile Prison (Eastern Province), Ngoma Prison (Eastern Province), Nyamagabe Prison (Southern Province) and Nyarugenge Prison (Kigali).</p><p>From a list of 40 women convicted of abortion, two women did not admit to having abortions; thus, 38 women met the inclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent, three enumerators conducted and audio recorded semi-structured interviews. During the interviews, if a participant needed a break due to emotional distress, a psychotherapist was availed for support. Interview narratives were then transcribed and translated. Data from the structured questionnaires were analyzed through SPSS version 22. MAXQDA was implemented to assess qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods data for Windows. Descriptive statistics facilitated the meaningful distribution of measurements and to also describe, summarize, and organize data.</p><p>Likewise, a codebook was prepared to assess qualitative variables. These variables were subsequently analyzed based on content analysis to measure the frequency of emerging themes</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Causes</p><p>All of the 38 participants were classified as poor under Rwanda’s Participatory Poverty Assessment, “Ubudehe,” based on land ownership and employment titles. Approximately 26% of women convicted (n=10) were illiterate, whereas only 5.3% of women (n=2) completed secondary school. Although rape is an exemption for legal abortion, 28.9% of women convicted (n=11) were raped but were unaware of the law. Eleven women convicted (28.9%) stated that their partner left and hated her; 26.3% of women (n=10) claimed that the man denied the pregnancy; and 23.7% of women (n=9) stated that the man went missing after news of the pregnancy.</p><p>Practices</p><p>Only 23.7% of women (n=9) obtained an abortion performed by a trained health provider (i.e. a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) while 76.3% women (n=29) had an abortion by a traditional healthcare provider. Nine women (23.7%) bought traditional plants and 13.2% of women (n=5) independently purchased tablets in a pharmacy. Almost all women (89.5%) confirmed that techniques used to terminate the pregnancy were neither appropriate nor effective.</p><p>Consequences</p><p>Women reported bleeding, vomiting, and pain as primary abortion outcomes. Across the interviews, women were observed to have low self-esteem, anxiety, social isolation, post-traumatic stress, obstetrics and gynecological issues, and symptoms of depression. Although the women are imprisoned for one to three years, community members and families view these women as permanently guilty and stigmatize them for not conforming to societal and cultural standards.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Findings address the lack of knowledge regarding the causes, practices, and consequences of terminated pregnancies for convicted women. HDI learned that even when women are eligible for abortion, obtaining a written report by two medical doctors and receiving a court order pose insurmountable challenges. The near impossibility of accessing legal and safe abortions disproportionately affects vulnerable and poor women, often under the age of 25, who lack any legal representation during their court cases. The consequences of these illegal abortions are not merely physical, but rather they impact the women throughout their life course—compounding poverty, stifling social connections, and creating internal distress related to the unsafe procedure and lack of emotional support.</p><p>This research has significant implications for advocacy work to expand access to safe and legal abortion. HDI recommends that coalitions that work on sexual health and reproductive rights lobby Parliamentarians, the Law Reform Commission, Ministers, and other civil society organizations (CSOs) to remove the court order and the requirement of two physician signatures; add child defilement as an exemption; consider mental as well physical health of the pregnant woman when analyzing the threat to the health of the woman; and include more qualified health professionals abortion providers. Through radio, district meetings, and “<em>umuganda”</em> (community volunteer days), CSOs should provide awareness-raising sessions on the law that permits safe abortion under the four exemptions. CSOs should increase efforts on responsible fatherhood, consent, and positive masculinity by working with young men and boys.</p>",

      "title": "Adding Client Focus to an Urban Outreach Initiative:  Implications from an Urban-ASHA Contraceptive Intervention Research Study in Uttar Pradesh, India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Contraceptive use in urban areas of India is declining, driving a national reduction in the modern contraceptive prevalence rate even as growing overall urbanization increases the population living in cities with easy access to contraceptive commodities and services. In response to this decline, efforts around India are increasingly focusing on knowledge, access, and the client-experience, which impact women’s decisions to seek, adopt, and continue use of contraceptives. In Uttar Pradesh, our program supports the Government of India’s urban ASHA (community health outreach worker) program, providing additional training to ASHAs to improve their contraceptive knowledge and their patient-centered approach to interacting with potential and confirmed adopters.</p><p>Contraceptive adoption is influenced by past experiences, reports of experiences of friends and family, and treatment during consultation and care. For both the immediate patient experience and the longer-term effects of positive or negative stories shared with others, the human interaction and experiences of care matter significantly. This intervention adds a person-centered approach to an existing training program. We will assess the effects of increased client focus on decisions to adopt contraception and the overall experience among adopters.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The intervention will train ASHAs on person-centered family planning (PCFP) principles. The intervention group will receive PCFP training in addition to standardized government training on contraceptive counseling, whereas the control group will receive the standardized government contraceptive counseling training only. We will compare PCFP scores among women who have interacted with a PCFP-trained ASHA versus women who have interacted with a non-PCFP trained ASHA. We also aim to understand whether women exposed to PCFP-trained ASHAs are more likely to adopt a contraceptive method.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To understand acceptability of training content, we will test the PCFP training component with ASHAs in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. We will assess acceptability via a post-training survey. At intervention launch, ASHAs will be assigned to an intervention or control group. ASHAs in both arms will be trained on enhanced family planning counseling skills through an existing program. Intervention ASHAs will receive additional training in PCFP principles. Women who received contraceptive counseling will be surveyed approximately 3 months following the ASHA’s training on either FP only or PCFP. The study is powered to detect a 10% difference in mean PCFP score between arms. Within each arm, we will survey 271 women who are family planning adopters and 271 non-adopters. The total sample size will be 1,084. PCFP will be assessed using a validated 30-item scale to ascertain the woman’s experience with the ASHA overall, and in specific person-centered domains of dignity, respect, autonomy and communication. We will use the Method Information Index (MII) to assess contraception counseling quality and knowledge of risks/side effects. We will conduct chi-square analysis to understand change in PCFP scores between arms and determine the associated odds ratio to measure increased likelihood of contraceptive method adoption.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>ASHA acceptability of, and adoption of, PCFP practices in the communication and promotion of family planning options will be assessed along with the effects of PCFP practices on clients.</p><p>We hypothesize that women randomized to the PCFP ASHA arm will be more likely to have adopted a contraceptive method. We hypothesize that women who were visited by an ASHA trained in PCFP will have had a better experience during the process of family planning adoption, including a greater sense of respect, autonomy, higher social and personal support, better health information, and improved self-efficacy compared to the control arm.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Urban women, unlike rural women who have been the traditional target of the ASHA outreach program, are more likely to be aware of contraception and have easy geographic access to family planning options. Because of this we hypothesize that motivation strengthened by respectful care practices, rather than simply communication of information, will be central to the ability of urban ASHAs to change behavior and use. </p><p>Experiences with public health programs in India are often poor, particularly among low-income populations and scheduled castes and tribes. In this context we believe that assuring a rights-based approach to family planning is critical and will matter significantly to the effectiveness of an outreach initiative. Understanding the degree to which person-centered care does or can contribute to women’s uptake and use of contraception is an important finding which can guide state and national outreach plans.</p><p>This evaluation builds off of an already existing contraceptive intervention ongoing in Uttar Pradesh, making it highly scalable should the findings be positive. This evaluation is unique because it will measure both the impact of the intervention on women’s experiences of person-centered care and on method adoption in a rigorous manner. Study findings will inform the field of person-centered care interventions for contraception, and are likely to be applicable to community health worker programs throughout India and in other settings that use similar models.</p><p></p>",

      "title": "Client-provider interaction: Evaluating client’s experience with family planning service providers through mystery client approach in India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The client and service provider interactions are very critical moment in any family planning (FP) decision. As this is the time when a potential client adopts a method, a satisfied user gets the supplies and encouragement to continue, and a dissatisfied user can resolve problems or switch methods. A literature review on the attitude of providers, showed that in developing countries including India, often there is a significant difference in women’s and providers’ knowledge and awareness about contraceptive methods and how they view FP. This knowledge gap often leads the provider to minimize the interpersonal communication with their clients and that results in incomplete counseling. Women who receive inadequate counseling and knowledge about side effects are found to be significantly more likely to stop using contraceptives, while those who were fully counseled on side effects are likely to continue using contraceptives either with the same method or with a different, more acceptable method.</p><p>While talking to clients if providers consider more about clients’ family planning needs, concerns, and clear up client misunderstandings, it can improve clients’ understanding of their options. It will enable clients to make more realistic choices when offered information that is tailored to their own needs.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Present qualitative study was restricted to the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Data for these two states shows that across both states, women were generally not informed about FP methods other than the one they were currently using, many weren’t aware of side effects or how to manage them if they experienced it.  This paper explores two key quality of care issues: How clients and providers communicate with one another? And what are the provider’s biases that hinders contraceptive uptake among potential clients? Data for this study was collected during 2017 in the states of UP and Bihar, two</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this study was collected during 2017 in the states of UP and Bihar, two states with low contraceptive prevalence in India. Female field investigators were trained to behave like family planning services client. The trained mystery client visited family planning service providers, pretending to be a new family planning client. Each mystery client was given a specific scenario. All mystery clients were strictly asked to not under go any physical examination or procedure in any situation.</p><p>Following the visit, the mystery clients were interviewed by another investigator and the interview is further transcribed. Investigators reviewed the transcripts and the data were entered into ATLAS. ti, Two researchers independently coded the data using the software program ATLAS. ti, and cross-coding between them ensured the consistency of coding. They developed a series of code guides and assigned codes to everything the client and provider said. In the last step, the coders independently recoded each transcript using the code book, then met to review the coded transcripts and decide how to resolve discrepancies.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Mystery clients reported that most of the providers did not give them enough time and they talked to them for 2-5 minutes only.</p><p>“<em>In a public health facility, it took 20 minutes to reach doctor. She spoke to me for 2 minutes and then referred me to ANM for other information</em>”</p><p>When asked if providers used IEC materials and samples while explaining about any method.</p><p>“<em>She did not use IEC materials although there were some posters related to FP on the clinic walls</em>”</p><p>It seems providers are hesitant in suggesting methods to newly married women. Almost all the providers suggested condoms as the first choice for newly married mystery client.</p><p>“<em>She said condoms and pills are only options for you. In case your husband does not agree to use condom, you will have to take pills. Any other method than these two may cause you problems in future so I will not recommend anything else</em>”</p><p>Very few providers explained how method works and what could be the side effects.</p><p><em>“In the private clinic doctor asked me about my reproductive history and then suggested copper-T. I had to ask her about how it works and what are the side effects then only she told me about it.”</em></p><p>Clients reported that there was not any privacy when they were talking to providers and other people can listen to their conversation.</p><p>“<em>The room was crowded and there were other patients and nurses discussing their problems. Everybody can listen to it and there was no privacy</em>”</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Present paper has two major contributions in ongoing quality of care issue in family planning programs. First, this introduces mystery client approach which has yet not been utilized very intensively in India. This approach allows researchers to collect information on service delivery practices as they occur naturally, in the absence of data collectors and research staff, and therefore can provide critical insights into aspects of care that may limit contraceptive uptake. Second, the results indicate that there is issue of quality of care and provider biases which may be hindering use of family planning services among potential clients. Very few providers talked about side effects or follow-up with their clients. Adequate counselling about side effects and how to correctly use a method may help reduce two critical problems in family planning practice: clients using methods incorrectly and clients discontinuing methods after only brief use. Such findings are useful for advancing provider training, heightened supervision of providers, and for situation analysis and evaluation of ongoing programs. Providers should be trained to have unbiased attitudes toward all contraceptive methods and have adequate technical knowledge and skills.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Quality of care (QoC) is critical for higher contraceptive uptake and more effective use of methods. Method information index (MII) is a composite index among women who currently use select modern methods, measuring an aspect of the process dimension of QoC. Women are considered having received ‘method information’ if she was told about other methods, side effects, <strong><em>and</em></strong> what to do in case of side effects – when she adopted the method she uses currently. Counseling regarding side effects is important especially, as women’s concerns about side effects are a major reason for contraceptive discontinuation and unmet need for family planning. MII can be calculated using data from widely available population-based surveys, and it is a routinely reported key indicator in many surveys. It is also a core indicator to monitor progress of FP2020 and monitored annually when possible. However, its association with the outcome of care has not been studied extensively. Better understanding of its utility to predict key QoC outcome measures – in addition to its importance from rights-based family planning perspectives – will provide evidence for continued use of MII to monitor and improve QoC. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study purpose is to assess associations between MII and QoC outcome variables measured among women who currently use contraceptives, using representative population-based survey data. Specifically, we will test if MII and its three individual components are positively associated with women’s reported willingness to return to and recommend the provider. We will further examined if the associations vary by women’s background characteristics.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data came from the latest Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) surveys conducted in eight sub-Saharan African countries. The female survey is representative for the population in a country or selected sub-national geographies. Among women using modern contraceptive currently, women are asked if she received the three components of ‘method information’ when she started using the current method. Women are further asked about two outcomes of experiential quality of care: if she would return to the provider, and if she would refer friends and relatives to the provider.</p><p>To assess the association between MII and experiential quality outcome, a binary variable was created to classify women who are willing to return to <strong><em>and</em></strong> recommend the provider. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate odds of willingness to return and recommend by having received method information – either all three or individual components, adjusted for women’s background characteristics. Analyses were restricted to those who currently use five methods (sterilization, IUD, implant, injectables, and pills, accounting for 73% of modern method users across the surveys, on average) and adjusted for survey sample design. All analyses were conducted by survey in each country/geography, and results were compared across 15 surveys.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Across 15 surveys, on average, 15% of women reported using the five methods on average (range: 4% in Anambra, Nigeria – 39% in Kenya) and were included in analyses. On average, 41% of women using the five contraceptive methods reported having been informed on all three components of method information (range: 19% in Kongo Central, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – 60.1% in Kaduna, Nigeria). By individual component, 62%, 59%, and 50% of women using the methods were informed on other methods, side effects, and what to do if side effects occur, respectively. On average, 74% of the women reported that they would return to and recommend the provider (range: 32% in Kongo Central, DRC – 92% in Kenya).</p><p>In 12 out of 15 surveys, women who received method information were more likely to report wiliness to return to and recommend the provider than their counterparts, adjusted for background characteristics (odds ratio (OR) mean: 2.9, range: 1.9 in Kaduna, Nigeria – 4.4 in Kinshasa, DRC). The association was statistically significant in six and marginally significant in the rest six surveys. When each component of method information was examined separately, results were largely similar across the three components. Women who were informed about other methods, side effects, and its management were more likely to report the positive perspectives than their counterparts on average by 3.0 (n=9), 2.7 (n=9), and 2.7 (n=11) times, respectively.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>PMA2020 female surveys collect information process and outcome dimensions of QoC. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the relationship between method information and an experiential quality outcome measure. Women’s perspectives reported in population-based surveys is substantially less likely to be affected by courtesy bias, which is commonly observed in client exit interviews. Study findings show method information counseling is low and is positively associated with women’s willingness to return to or recommend the providers, across 15 countries/geographies in sub-Saharan Africa. Provision of quality method information is critical not only for voluntary informed choice for family planning methods but also for improving experiential quality of care.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p> The 2012 London Summit on Family Planning resolved that every woman should be able to access modern contraception by 2020. In order to achieve this goal, 18 measurement indicators were suggested to aid in monitoring progress periodically, in the provision of family planning services in the world’s 69 poorest countries. Of these, is the Method Information Index (MII), which measures the information received by women at a time they receive family planning services (Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) 2017). The MII is regarded as one of the core indicators that can be used to measure the quality of care in the provision of family planning services (Bruce 1990; RamaRao and Jain 2016). An improvement in quality through adequate and correct information exchange about the source and availability of contraceptive methods, how to use different types of contraception, where to go for additional supplies, possible side effects, and how to manage health complications should they occur, would lead to continuous use of contraception (Jain 2016). In this study, we examine quality of provision of family planning services by assessing method information exchange between clients and service providers in five East African countries.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main objective of this study is to provide evidence of improvements in the quality in the provision and use of contraception, when the method information index (MII) that is used as a proxy measure of quality is employed. We answer this by investigating if the use of modern contraception in the five East African countries under study is dependent on family planning information exchange.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We considered 14 DHS surveys that collected information about method information exchange in Ethiopia (2016, 2011, 2005), Kenya (2014, 2008/09), Rwanda (2014/15, 2010, 2005), Tanzania (2015/16, 2010, 2004/05), and Uganda (2011, 2006, 2000/01). We computed the MII using information from responses to three questions among current users of contraception at the start of their last episode of contraceptive use: 1) was the woman told about the availability of other contraceptive methods; 2) was the woman told about possible side effects from using their chosen methods; and 3) was the woman informed how to manage side effects should they arise. The estimated MII is the proportion of women who were currently using a contraceptive method and answered in affirmative to all the three questions. Only women whose most recent contraceptive method initiation occurred in the five years preceding the survey were considered. Finally, we also investigated the key indicators of method information exchange. We further restrict the sample to women aged 15-49 who know of at least a contraceptive method and have ever used contraception. The largest sample is 17,500 women in the Kenya 2014 DHS and the smallest is 2,441 women in the Rwanda 2005 DHS. However, only the recent</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The results show the same pattern of method-specific information indices – higher for LARCs than short-term methods in all surveys other than the Rwanda 2005 DHS. Higher method information indices are observed in more recent surveys in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Rwanda but not in Tanzania or Uganda. However, current use indicate that the majority of users adopt short-term methods as compared to LARCs or permanent methods, although a steady increase in the proportion of women adopting LARCs with time is observed. Low motivation to adopt LARCs or permanent methods is likely to be as a result of the ease that comes with obtaining non-clinical methods such as the pill from outside of clinical settings. Further, the fact that LARCs may not be popular methods in these countries as compared to short-term methods, there may be a need to provide adequate and correct information on how to use them so as to promote popularity, adoption, and continuity.</p><p>The results demonstrate that the factors that predict information exchange are country-specific with the exception of the contraceptive method used. However, in all countries, the number of surviving children did not matter at predicting contraceptive information exchange. The results from the study lend themselves to the conclusion that users of LARCs or permanent methods are more likely to have more information exchange than users of short term methods in East Africa. Despite this, results from the model suggest that method information exchange is a key indicator of modern contraception use.  </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results in this paper underscore the importance of information exchange as one of the major indicators highlighted by FP2020, to monitor progress in the provision of family planning services in the 69 world’s poorest countries. Our main contribution from the study is to provide evidence that method information exchange is an important predictor of contraceptive use in the five countries. However, results indicate that users of LARCs – used by the minority of women – reported to receive more information exchange than users of more-preferred short term methods. This we argue, might be of concern in the reproductive health sector. We think that this may be a result of users of short-term methods being able to obtain them outside of clinical settings but without adequate or correct information exchange, which is unlikely to happen with LARCs.</p><p>Although concerted efforts to ensure that users of LARCs receive adequate information exchange so as to promote continuity in use, this study highlights the need to also provide adequate and correct information to a larger proportion of women using short-term methods. Finally, the results suggest that background factors that predict information exchange are largely country-specific, but approaches aimed at increasing continuity in use of contraception should provide more opportunities for information exchange by taking advantage of the mostly adopted contraceptive methods. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) indicates that more than four in ten births are unplanned. Use of modern methods of contraception is 35%, and there is high unmet need for family planning (FP). Further, there is a high fertility prevalence among women in rural areas, and 25 percent of adolescents aged 15-19 years in Uganda have already begun childbearing. The relatively low use of contraception contributes to high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, unplanned pregnancy, and fertility.</p><p></p><p>To increase access to contraceptives and reduce unmet need for family planning, Marie Stopes International Uganda (MSIU) adopted a ‘total market approach’ (TMA) to maximize market efficiency, equity, and sustainability through the coordination of the public and private sectors. The ‘total market approach’ is designed around the needs of Ugandan women and is focused on increasing access to high quality and affordable choice of FP services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>As part of the TMA, we employ strategies that tackle barriers to voluntary FP uptake, such as removing cost barriers for the poor, building FP service capacity, and bringing integrated services to vulnerable populations, including rural communities, urban poor, youth, post-partum women, and women living with HIV.</p><p></p><p>To deliver services and meet the various needs of our key populations listed above, we use a multi-pronged approach to service delivery. Mobile outreach services focus on rural areas; engagement with private health providers in peri-urban areas; use of public health workers, and urban mobile outreaches delivers services to youth and key populations.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Mobile outreach channel focuses on rural service delivery, which are often poor and underserved, delivering a full range of FP methods and high-quality counselling at public health facilities.  We reach vulnerable populations like adolescents 15-19,  using tricycle “Tuk-Tuks” with integrated SRH services. In 2017, we had 27 outreach teams and 8 Tuk-Tuk teams. Each outreach team has a medical doctor, 2 nurses, and a transport assistant.</p><p></p><p>Private health facilities (N=225) are accredited into our social franchise network, “BlueStar”, to provide FP services to urban and peri-urban communities. FP Vouchers are distributed in areas with active franchisees to remove cost barriers to FP use.  Women purchase FP vouchers directly from Community Based Distributors, and redeem them at accredited BlueStar providers, to access FP services at a subsidized rate.</p><p></p><p>MSIU has 75 Dedicated Providers (DPs) within selected health center IV and hospitals across Uganda, to provide comprehensive FP services as part of public sector capacity strengthening.</p><p></p><p>In addition to routine data on service use, vouchers and demographics, we also conducted a client exit survey on a random sample of 1,593 clients.  To demonstrate estimated health and demographic impacts of the TMA, Marie Stopes International’s (MSI) Impact 2 tool was used.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In 2017, MSIU delivered 8,459 tubal ligations, 516 vasectomies, 232,250 implants, 40,226 IUD, 32,262 Depo injections, 6,681 pills, and 1,345,065 condoms. The mobile outreach channel comprised about 64% of service delivery, while social franchise was 27% and public-sector support contributed 9%.</p><p></p><p>The Exit interview results show that in 2017, about 15% of our clients were adolescents under 20 years old, and about a quarter of clients were under 25 years old. The results indicated that about one quarter of our clients lived in extreme poverty (under $1.90/day PPP). Mobile outreach, which is targeted at the poor, has about 21% of clients in extreme poverty, and nearly 62% live on less than $2.50 per day.</p><p></p><p>Results also show that 53% of FP clients were adopters (did not use FP in past 3 months), while 23% were continuing FP users, and 24% changed from another provider to MSIU.</p><p></p><p>Using MSI’s Impact 2 model, we estimate the impacts of the FP services provided in 2017 (especially LAPM) will span over multiple future years.  These services averted or will avert an estimated 97,700 unintended pregnancies; 230 maternal deaths, 29,000 unsafe abortions, and 204,600 disability-adjusted life years (DALYS). We also estimate our FP service provision saved $3.95 million in direct healthcare costs to the Ugandan healthcare system and contributed 3 percentage points to national mCPR in 2017.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The TMA provides access to a high quality and affordable choice of comprehensive FP services at health facility and community levels. There is increased access to quality services to men and women who are more likely to have an unmet need for FP, such as adolescents, the poor, and those living in rural areas.</p><p></p><p>The TMA increases access to FP, particularly long-acting and permanent methods, which are often more difficult to access in low-resource settings due to lack of commodities, skilled providers, facilities, etc. In addition, providing better counselling and full method mix services empowers women with the information and access they need to select a contraceptive method that meets their needs. The Client Exit Interview results shows how the TMA reaches to the underserved groups such as young clients, poor clients, and FP adopters. Young people form a particularly vulnerable group that is important to reach with contraceptive services, as they are more likely to be at risk of injury or even death if they do become pregnant.  </p><p></p><p>Finally, given the multi-pronged service delivery approach allows MSIU to operate at scale. The TMA approach provides a significant contribution to achieving Uganda’s goal of increasing modern CPR from 25% in 2011 to 50% in 2020.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>There are very few countries that are applying Total Market Approach (TMA) principles or a TMA process.  Kenya is one of a few countries whose FP programme is operating within a comprehensive TMA framework. </p><p>In most developing country markets, the for-profit and commercial sector (typically manufacturers and distributors of FP products that do not operate with subsidies) is typically overlooked. They can be viewed as having too small a share in the FP market to be significant or to not be incentivised to support more access to FP. </p><p>Distortions in health markets - such as richer women using subsidised services, or products being leaked from the public sector for resale in the private sector - can also go ignored, even though such distortions can prevent greater access to FP and cost significant amounts of funds each year.</p><p>Through applying TMA analysis to Kenya’s FP market we are able to comprehensively demonstrate how large and important the commercial sector is in increasing access and uptake to FP.  Our analysis has also demonstrated the size of distortions which, if reduced, could also results in financial savings which could then be reinvested to further increase FP access and use.  </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>ESHE is the largest single FP programme in Kenya.  With £30m of support by the UK government’s Department for International Development (DFID) since 2013, the programme has expanded access to FP in 41 out of 47 counties, including the most marginalised.</p><p>Since 2015, in partnership with the Ministry of Health, ESHE has pioneered Kenya’s first comprehensive TMA with the objective of expanding access to FP products and services more sustainably.  ESHE is the only DFID-funded programme globally that has a specific TMA mandate, and Kenya one of a few countries that has significant practical TMA experiences, insights and lessons learned. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Two analyses were carried out to identify some key distortions in Kenya’s FP market and the size and role of the commercial sector:</p>\t<li><strong>Market segmentation analysis </strong>was carried out to demonstrate how the different FP segments across the wealth quintiles in rural and urban populations use services and products between the public and private sectors.</li><p>Market segmentation was carried out in early 2016 through a secondary analysis of the raw data from Kenya’s 2014 Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS).  The analysis was carried out between Palladium staff in Nairobi, Kenya, and Washington D.C.  <em>SPSS Statistics</em> was used to carry out the quantitative analysis.</p>\t<li><strong>Commercial sector distribution analysis </strong>was carried out to demonstrate the wider role of the private sector increasing access to FP.</li><p>Analysis was carried out in 2016 and 2017 by Palladium and IQVIA staff in Nairobi, Kenya, through desk review of grey and published literature; key informant interviews, and; analysis of commercial sector distribution data from across Kenya. </p><p>Commercial sector data was disaggregated by manufacturer; brand; product type and quantities of products distributed.  Commercial sector distribution data was analysed using <em>AtlasTi</em>, and compared to total FP market data, i.e. public sector and social marketing. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Market segmentation analysis highlights there is significant use of the public sector, largely free and heavily subsidised FP products.  More than 50% of women from the top two wealth quintiles in urban areas used implants from the public sector.  Almost 50% of women from the same quintile accessed injections from the public sector.  Over half of public sector pill and injectable users could most likely pay commercial prices for their method.</p><p></p><p>The analysis indicates major leakage of FP products from the public to private sectors.  While 95% of all injectable commodities in Kenya are free products through the public sector, only 63% of injectables were used in the public sector.  Almost 35% found their way into the private, commercial sector.  While less than 2% of Kenya’s pills were brought into Kenya though the commercial sector, almost 58% of all pills were subsequently sold through the commercial sector. </p><p>Kenya’s commercial sector was believed to only account for 1% of the total share of the FP market.  Our 2016 analysis indicates the commercial sector accounted for almost 6% of the market.  The same analysis in 2017 indicates that the commercial sector now accounts for 26% of the total market.</p><p>In 2016, the quantified investments by the commercial sector in FP products (without any donor subsidy) totalled more than USD1m.  Investments made in 2017 are being quantified and are expected to demonstrate a significant increase from 2016.  Final financial investments made by the commercial sector will be ready for final presentation at ICFP.  </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>TMA research - including market segmentation and wider analysis of a country’s FP market - can demonstrate what a total FP market looks like, including distortions and the role of various players within a market. </p><p>Understanding distortions in an FP market, and being able to quantify them, highlights the extent and costs of inefficiencies that can prevent access to FP being scaled up further through better allocation of resources. </p><p>Such analysis is critical to enabling countries to make informed policy and programming decisions to support a TMA that will increase access more equitably.  It will also support development partners to make more informed decisions over how they will support FP programmes with subsidies and robust regulation of subsidies, as well as the tracking of product leakage between the public, commercial and not-for-profit sectors. </p><p>Quantifying FP market inefficiencies in monetary terms also helps governments and development partners comprehend the costs and scale of how funds are not reaching FP user segments they are intended to. </p><p>Our analysis demonstrates that in emerging health markets such as Kenya’s, the role of the commercial sector is likely to be larger and more comprehensive than commonly believed. </p><p>Better understanding the total FP market, including the true size and contribution of various partners and how much they invest in FP products and services, should help to reduce the total amount of funding required from governments and development partners – especially when such data is incorporated into national FP forecasting and quantification processes and procurement plans.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Knowledge (of any method) of contraceptive methods is widespread in Myanmar (more than 90% of all men and women). Still, only 51% of married women of reproductive age are currently using a modern method, and 16% have an unmet need for family planning. Focused health communication campaigns and materials can promote behavioural change that translates knowledge into practice, but this requires understanding of the intended audiences and their aspirations and attitudes as well as the challenges they face in accessing family planning (FP) information and services.   </p><p>Marie Stopes International Myanmar has been working since 1997 to ensure access to essential sexual and reproductive healthcare information and services. Through clinics, mobile outreach and social marketing initiatives, we deliver commodities, information and services, mainly in the FP sector. In 2017 we designed and conducted the Consumer Insight and Market Segmentation (CIMS) Survey to understand the needs and perspectives of current and potential FP clients and to define market segments according to socio-demographic and psychographic characteristics.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We sought (i) to define market segments based on socio-demographic, attitudinal and lifestyle indicators; (ii) to gather insights on respondents’ access to FP information and services; and (iii) to make programmatic recommendations for effective behavioural and marketing interventions.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted a cross-sectional population-based household survey in 13 townships in October and November 2017. We used multi-staged random sampling, using probability proportionate to size to sample the townships. We sampled 80 households per township randomly and invited one woman per household to be interviewed. Female research assistants administered a structured questionnaire, using computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) devices, to consenting women ages 18 to 49 years. We asked about knowledge and awareness of FP services; experiences with contraception; decision-making about accessing FP services; fertility intentions; attitudes towards life; and lifestyle. We first analysed data descriptively using SPSS. To categorise the market segments (Aspiring Mothers, Passive Mothers, Informed Matriarchs, Aspiring Pre-Children and Deferential Pre-Children, Strong Rejectors), we divided the sample by life stage (women who have not yet had children versus those who have at least one). We then used discriminant analysis on several paired attitudinal statement indicators (including women’s role in society, education, and empowerment) to segment the market into lifestyle groups. Women were classified as ‘aspiring mothers’ if they had at least one child; were open to life beyond the family, and displayed behaviour that supports their personal and family goal.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Some 1040 women completed interviews. Their mean age was 33 years; 70% had at least some middle school education; 48% were current users of modern FP. ‘Aspiring mothers’ was the largest market segment identified (49%, n=510). This group was older than the sample average (nearly half were 30–39 years old); 67% wanted small families, and ideal family size averaged four children. Half (52%) wanted no more children, and the injectable was the most common current modern method, used by 29%. </p><p>More than three-quarters (77%) of ‘aspiring mothers’ said they openly discuss FP matters with their husbands; 74% said that they feared side effects of modern contraceptives; 65% believed that it is up to the women to decide how many children to have; 76% said that they would like to try new ways of doing things; 73% said they want to do more with their lives than have children and look after the home.</p><p>For ‘aspiring mothers’, the factors most influencing FP service choices were affordable price (55%), staff that explains things understandably (51%) and quality service (43%). Close friends and family (84%) and neighbours (44%) were their main sources of FP information; 75% were interested in receiving information via telephone and online platform. Nearly half reported that they felt shy and embarrassed to talk about FP with service providers. Some 38% reported fear of unfair judgements by an FP service provider. One-quarter (25%) expressed concern about poor quality, and 21% feared high service charges.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>‘Aspiring mothers’ are the largest psychographic market segment in Myanmar, with strong desires to limit their family size. They represent an important group to address with behavioural change communication since many are not currently practicing FP, are open to trying new things, and want to do more with their life than look after their children and home. Their reliance on friends, family and neighbours for information suggests that we could strengthen the use of satisfied clients and community-based mobilizers as agents to provide focused messages and achieve behavioural change. Aspiring mothers’ interest in telephone and online messages suggests an opportunity to innovate and pilot-test mhealth interventions and an online information portal to inform these women about family planning. Since they are likely to consult their husbands, couple counselling and information addressed to men would help to facilitate joint decision-making. These women are concerned about side effects of modern contraception; this concern needs to be addressed with focused communication. Perceptions of poor quality and judgemental providers will require a service-side response to provide high-quality client-centred care; and the perception of price barriers suggests that policy- and systems-level responses may be required to make FP affordable and accessible to a group that is ready and willing to take up long-term contraception.</p>",

      "title": "Segmented Client Approach Helps Increase the Use of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives and Permanent Methods in Bangladesh: Findings from an Operations Research",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Bangladesh made remarkable success in increasing contraceptive use that resulted in reduced fertility to almost replacement level. But the observed fertility rate is still much higher than women’s wanted fertility, resulting high incidence of unintended birth. One estimate suggests that about 30% of annual births are unintended. In addition, there is high incidence of menstrual regulation (MR) and abortion. An efficient way of tackling high incidences of unintended fertility and MR and abortion is to increase the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) and permanent methods (PM). About two-thirds of women do not want to have any more children, i.e., they want to limit fertility and thus they need to use methods that are appropriate for limiting pregnancy. Pill and injectables use is 27% and 15%, respectively. These two methods are appropriate for pregnancy spacing. LARCs/PMs are more appropriate for fertility limitation but their use is only 8%. Women complete their family size by age 30 and many of them continue to use pills or injectables which are prone to early discontinuation due to side effects or method unavailability and thus unintended pregnancy. Demand for LARC/PM is low, and numerous supply- and demand-side factors are associated with the low demand.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The basic ideas were to (a) identify pregnancy spacing and limitation needs of individual couple; (b) help individual couple through information giving and counseling to choose the appropriate method to meet their needs; (c) facilitate the couples to obtain the chosen method; and (d) provide follow-up services including counseling and treatment for method side effects and complications. Six categories of couples were differentially counselled at homes or at courtyard meetings by family welfare assistants (FWAs). Leaflets and flip charts showing method characteristics were used at counseling. Every new LARC/PM acceptors were followed up, counseled, and treated for side effects.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Segmented-client approach interventions were implemented in Akhaura <em>Upazilla</em> (subdistrict) of Brahmanbaria District and in Jaintapur <em>Upazilla</em> of Sylhet District during May 2013 to July 2014. Difference-in-differences analysis was carried out in a “before-after and intervention-comparison” framework. Baseline and endline surveys were conducted in March-May 2013 and September-December 2014, respectively, in intervention <em>Upazilla</em>s (Akhaura and Jaintapur) and Comparison <em>Upazilla</em>s (Kashba and Gwainghat). The evaluation involved a total of about 12,000 women surveyed in these areas in two periods. IUD and implant acceptors were followed up to collect information on discontinuation and their reasons for discontinuation.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During the 15-month intervention period, FWA’s home visits increased from 18% (baseline) to 46% (endline) in the intervention areas, compared to from 9% to 6% in the comparison areas. At the endline, 37% of women in the intervention areas reported that they attended courtyard meeting, compared to only 1% in the comparison areas. At the endline 22% women in the intervention areas reported that they received leaflets, compared to no women reporting about receiving any leaflets in the comparison areas.</p><p> </p><p>Contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) for modern methods increased by 3.2% (from 39.7% to 42.9%) due to an increase of both LARC/PM and short-acting methods. LARC/PM use increased by 1.9% (from 7.4% to 9.3%) in the intervention areas, compared to an increase of 0.8% (from 7.1% to 7.9%) in the comparison areas. Therefore, a 1.1% increase (1.9% minus 0.9%) was attributable to the intervention. Short-acting method use also increased in the intervention areas by 1.3% (from 32.3% to 33.6%) but that in comparison areas declined. There was an improvement of continuation of IUD and implant in the intervention areas as 12-month discontinuation of these methods was lower in the intervention than comparison areas.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Contraceptive use, both short-acting and LARC/PM, increased through <em>targeted counseling</em> at home and courtyard. Client-FWA contacts increased substantially. The findings indicate that it is possible to further increase both short-acting and LARC/PM. The interventions have been powerful to increase contraceptive use. For further increasing contraceptive and LARC/PM use, the FP programs may replicate or scale up the interventions within their health systems.</p><p></p><p>However, it should be underscored that “program readiness” is a precursor to effective implementation of any FP intervention, which are <em>clinical training</em>, <em>BCC training</em>, <em>development of BCC materials</em>, and <em>placing appropriate providers in place</em>. Among these four main activities, the first three are relatively straightforward if investment can be made. Regarding the last one—placing appropriate providers in place—is a huge challenge for Bangladesh. The government FP program has a serious problem of unavailability of LARC/PM providers. One half (51%) of posts of medical officer-MCHs (the lone provider of implants and PM) and about one quarter (23%) of family welfare visitors, lone provider of IUD, remain vacant. This is a chronic situation and has not been solved in last 30 years. Moreover, only one quarter of government facilities that deliver FP services qualify the “readiness” criterion to provide quality services. At the community level, FWAs contact women with counseling, information, and some supplies. But the FWAs’ contact with women declined to only 20% in 2014 from 38% in 1994. This should be improved to increase client counseling at the community level.</p>",

      "title": "Continuation rates of injectable contraceptives DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM when administered by community health workers in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Injectable contraceptives are among the world’s most widely used methods for preventing pregnancy, offering women safe and effective protection, convenience, and privacy. In sub-Saharan Africa, injectable use has quadrupled from 2 percent in 1990 to 8 percent prevalence among married or in-union women in 2011. In Uganda, 19 percent of married or in-union women are using injectable contraception, accounting for 53 percent of all modern contraceptive use. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is the most commonly used injectable contraceptive, and it is customarily administered intramuscularly, under the brand name Depo-Provera® (generic: DMPA-IM). A new, lower-dose, subcutaneous version of DMPA, DMPA-SC, is now available that is improving women’s access to injectable contraceptives by facilitating community-based distribution and self-injection. </p><p>In Uganda, community-based health volunteers called Village Health Teams (VHTs) have been authorized to provide family planning products—including both DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM—to women in their communities since 2013. Following this authorization and national regulatory approval of DMPA-SC, under the brand name Sayana® Press, in 2014 and building on the Ugandan government's goal to expand contraceptive access into rural communities, the Ugandan Ministry of Health introduced VHT-delivered DMPA-SC in 28 districts starting in September 2014.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The aim of this study was to compare 12-month continuation rates of DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM when administered by community health workers in Uganda.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study was implemented in six districts through 27 health facilities, with affiliated VHTs recruiting women into the continuation study from among community-based clients who had decided to use either DMPA-SC or DMPA-IM. Enrollment began in December 2015 and participant follow-up continued until April 2017. In total, 609 women were enrolled in the DMPA-SC group and 615 in the DMPA-IM group. Following informed consent, a baseline interview was conducted and contact information for follow-up and the next injection appointment date noted. Women were followed for approximately one year and received follow-up surveys at 3 months and 9 months. Those who stopped the injectable, or who received their injections after the close of a 30-day injection window, were asked to respond to a discontinuation survey. In addition, special surveys were conducted for women who switched from one type of injectable method to another. Continuation rates were calculated based on the principle of intention to treat. Cox proportional hazards regression models were run to determine factors associated with the risk of discontinuation; factors included in the final hazard ratio model were chosen based on significance in crude hazard ratio for discontinuation and theoretical associations with discontinuation of injectable contraceptives in these settings.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The 12-month continuation was 77.8 percent for the DMPA-SC group and 77.4 percent for the DMPA-IM group (p=0.85, N=1224, 609 DMPA-SC and 615 DMPA-IM), based on intention to treat analysis. A total of 78 women switched from DMPA-SC to DMPA-IM, and 38 women switched from DMPA-IM to DMPA-SC (9 women switched at both the second and fourth injections). Women’s reported principle reasons for discontinuation included: being late for the injection (65/229, 28.4 percent), having received it from non-VHT (50/229, 21.8 percent), and side effects (34/229, 14.8 percent). Women’s primary reasons for discontinuation were similar across DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC groups. When considering multiple factors that could be linked to discontinuation, under a hazard ratio model, no single factor predicting discontinuation remains significant when adjusted for other variables despite many crude HRs that are statistically significant. Having a spouse/partner with other sexual partners (Adjusted HR = 1.5 (.94-2.3), p=0.09) and number of children (Adjusted HR = .87 (.75-1.0), p=0.08) come close to statistical significance however, with the first increasing the risk of discontinuation and the former protecting against discontinuation.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>There were no real differences in continuation between traditional DMPA-IM and the novel product DMPA-SC when both products were offered by community health workers. The continuation rates in this study were higher than national and global averages for injectable contraception, potentially reflecting an added benefit of community-based distribution of injectable contraception by VHTs or community health workers (CHWs). Continuation rates in this study were also higher than those observed among women who received DMPA-IM injections from facilities in Uganda in a separate but concurrent study. Women may be more likely to continue DMPA if they are able to visit a VHT located nearby for reinjections. Training, equipping, and supporting CHWs to provide a wide range of family planning methods is a proven high-impact practice in family planning, and our results reinforce the feasibility and potential benefits of community-based distribution of injectable contraception specifically. The policy implications of these findings are that introduction strategies for new injectable types, such as DMPA-SC, should focus on identifying delivery platforms that will maximize continuation rates and contribute to addressing unmet need.</p><p>These findings also suggest that more can be done to support women who may wish to continue using contraception longer. Side effects and being late for an injection were major reasons for discontinuation, reinforcing the importance of providing adequate counseling and offering a wide range of contraceptive options.</p>",

      "title": "Expanding community-based family planning programs to include emergency contraception",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Community-based family planning (CBFP) provision is one of the most efficient ways to ensure access to family planning (FP) services in rural and underserved areas. This proven high impact practice includes community health worker (CHW) provision of pills, condoms, Standard Days Method®, the Lactational Amenorrhea Method, injectables and emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs). ECPs are considered lifesaving commodity, however they remain relatively under-used globally and more so in rural areas. Barriers to ECP distribution and uptake include provider bias, misconceptions and fears surrounding ECPs. Data collection on ECP use and distribution is important for demonstrating demand and advocating for continued procurement. Counseling ECP users on transitioning to a routine method and HIV/AIDS prevention is important. This is the first project in Uganda to focus on CHW community-based provision of ECPs (CB-EC). </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The objective of this intervention was to gain support for the scale-up of ECPs, expand access to CBFP through capacity building, training and monitoring of health workers, create knowledge, interest, and demand for uptake of family planning services, and document and disseminate experiences and lessons. The approach focused on ECPs as a gap in the method mix, rather than a standalone method.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>While CHWs received some training on ECPs, they were not offering ECPs in the method mix. WellShare and FHI 360 conducted a formative assessment in 2014 to understand the dynamics of ECP distribution in Uganda. WellShare, Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH), FHI 360 and the International Consortium for Emergency Contraception developed and pretested a job aide and fact sheet for CHW use. WellShare developed a CB-EC training module using PATH and the World Health Organization CHW training materials/modules on EC and integrated it into a 2-day refresher on FP. These tools were shared with the Reproductive Health Commodities and Supplies/Family Planning Working Group (RHCS/FPWG) and MOH for input. In September 2016, the MOH endorsed the job aide and fact sheet. WellShare and other partners have used the training tools to train their CHWs in CB-EC. </p><p>WellShare updated project-level monitoring and quality improvement tools to integrate ECP, such as client registers, monthly health center summary forms, direct observation checklist for ECP, and supervision checklist. WellShare used these tools to collect data on CB-EC and track results. WellShare also conducted interviews with CB-EC clients to inform and improve service delivery. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p></p><p>After several years of targeted advocacy and stakeholder engagement, CB-EC is now an integral part of the MOH’s CBFP strategy, and implementing partners across Uganda can use the updated ECP sessions, M&amp;E tools, job aide and fact sheet to expand their CBFP method mix to include ECPs. </p><p></p><p>Integration of CB-EC into a CBFP program in Iganga and Kumi districts shows promising results. In Iganga District, 84% of ECPs (n=187) were dispensed at health facilities, 16% (n=37) were dispensed via outreach and 0% through CHWs at baseline (Q3, 2014). By Q4, 2017, 20% (n=36) of ECPs were dispensed by CHWs at community level. In Kumi District, at baseline, 100% (n= 16) of ECPs were dispensed through health facilities, but by Q4 2017 41% (n=53) of ECPs were dispensed by CHWs.  </p><p></p><p>Client surveys with 30 ECP clients showed satisfaction with CB-EC services and that CHWs reached youth. Overall client satisfaction ratings of CB-EC services received from client’s most recent visit with a health worker/CHW showed that 77% of clients in Kumi and 94% of clients in Iganga were very satisfied with the ECP services. More youth were reached in Kumi than Iganga; 62% of Kumi clients were under 30 years compared to 35% of Iganga clients. All surveyed clients (100%) from Kumi and Iganga said they had been treated in a friendly and respectful way. All surveyed clients (100%) in Kumi district and most clients (82%) in Iganga district reported easy access to the clinics or CHW providers for ECPs.  <i></i></p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Emergency contraception should be provided in community-based programs to increase access to this method for rural women who have relatively poor access to pharmacies and clinics. Emergency contraceptive pills also may create a bridge to more effective long-term methods of pregnancy prevention. (1) WellShare’s programmatic efforts combined with their targeted advocacy activities demonstrated that CB-EC is feasible. This innovative CBFP program resulted in the re-orientation of a majority of CBFP Implementing Partners operating at national level on the training tools, job aides, fact sheets, latest levonorgestrel ECPs brand names, and dispensation at community level. This created a renewed interest in ECPs and its place in the method mix amongst partners and the MOH. The efforts also ensured that CHWs know the brand names available in the public sector for referrals, received CBFP refresher training with CB-EC module, and had the necessary skills to provide the services. Some of the implementing partners (notably FHI 360) have since scaled up CB-EC into their CBFP programs and the MOH has updated the CHW CBFP training materials to include the new job aide and fact sheet on ECPs.</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) Chin-Quee, Dawn S., et al. “ARHP Commentary – Thinking (Re)Productively: In Support of Community-Based Emergency Contraception.” <em>Contraception</em>, vol. 94, no. 1, 2016, pp. 1–5., doi:10.1016/j.contraception.2016.03.002.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Nigeria has an estimated population of 192 million (NPoPC 2017 estimates) and with the growth rate of 3.2%, the population will double in 22 years. It is also among the top ten countries in the world when it comes to maternal mortality. With an estimated 36,000 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth in 2013, Nigeria accounted for almost 13% of the global maternal death burden and about 30% of these prevented deaths can be averted by improving access to family planning services and commodities. Teenage pregnancy remains a major concern in Nigeria because it is an important determinant of the overall level of fertility as well as the health and welfare of the mother and child.  NDHS 2013 reports that 14.9% of births are from girls aged 15-19 years. The most common challenges in health supply chain is related to stock-outs of essential supplies due to expiry, poor quantification and storage by  Health Care Workers , inefficient last mile distribution, and incomplete reporting. Health care in Nigeria’s public sector is provided at three levels: tertiary, secondary, and primary care levels. Doctors, midwives, and nurses are permitted to insert and remove implants and IUDs. These cadres are always available at secondary</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Nigeria National Council on Health (NCH) in July 2012 approved a policy to allow community health extension workers (CHEWs) to provide injectable contraceptives in communities and encouraged the Nigeria state Ministries of Health to scale up this practice. This was an important step to meet the Nigeria FMOH commitment made at the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning to “train our frontline health workers to deliver a range of contraceptives and especially to improve the utilization of long acting methods like the intrauterine devices and injectable contraceptives”.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The purpose of the intervention was to present the opportunities to expand voluntary access to FP Services through introduction of DMPA SC (Sayana Press) within the rights based approach using lower cadre health workers in communities. With this intervention, the plan was to distribute 2.5 million pieces of DMPA SC to 650,000 new users in 1 year period working in 10 implementing states Kebbi, Sokoto, Ebonyi, Gombe, FCT, Kaduna, Benue, Cross River, Akwa Ibom and Abia (potential to include Adamawa and Borno). The Community volunteer providers who were selected based on competency-based selection criteria, were trained and equipped with the outreach kit which contained the referral booklet, a booklet of primary data sheets, an apron, 144 pieces of male condom, 10 pieces of female condom, ID card, job aids on step by step of giving DMPA SC Injection, Adapted WHO MEC chart for community based groups, 1 roll of cotton wool, 1 tablet of soap, 1 bottle of methylated spirit. The commodities; oral pills, male and female condoms were supplied to the supervising Community Based Organisation (CBO) who in turn supply the volunteers.  Re- supply of DMPA SC injection and other methods were done in coordination with the CBO.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The intervention was predicated on three major hypothesis as follows; • A common conclusion is that inadequate physical access to supplies and services is one of the predominant causes of unmet need; therefore taking commodities and services closer to women in communities would increase uptake and reduce unmet need • Promoting access in community through administration by lower cadre health care workers including CHEWs and non-traditional distribution options (CORPS) would facilitate access to services especially in hard to reach areas and address the challenge of maldistribution of skilled health care workers • Injectable contraceptives are highly desirable in the Northern region and SE/SS region where the majority of the health workers are CHEWs 3912 providers trained (Community Health Extension workers and Community Volunteers) 129,885 units of DMPA SC distributed Most clients were new users of DMPA-SC or of a modern contraceptive method (82%), 12% were repeat DMPA-SC visits, and 6% switched to DMPA-SC from another method. 85,303 were new users of a modern method (there are about 2 million users added each year since 2014 from the FP program implemented in the public sector) 7% of all the users were under the age of 20 years. Overall, about 27% of DMPA-SC users were aged 20-24; only 7% were under 20. When disaggregated by state (Figure A.3), the largest percentage of users under 20 and aged 20-25 were observed in Akwa Ibom (AHI), Cross River (AHI), and Kebbi (ARFH). </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Many project states, particularly in more culturally and religiously conservative areas, community-based distribution was vital for reaching women who were unlikely to visit a facility and hence reach new users according to discussions with Implementing Partners. Different strategies appeared to be more effective for different user segments. Market and other public event-based outreach was a good strategy for certain geographies and certain sociodemographic categories. However, community-based distribution, and particularly house-to-house visits, was effective for both meeting privacy/confidentiality concerns and overcoming barriers to seeking healthcare outside the home among those with a latent demand for contraception. Including reaching younger users in the privacy of their homes, conducting outreach at universities and providing safes spaces for counseling were touted as more effective for this group. As program managers design the next phase of public sector DMPA-SC distribution, continuing elements of community-based distribution should be considered in order to enable contraceptive access for specific hard-to-reach populations (e.g., adolescents and young women; women living in the North.</p>",

      "title": "Introduction of Depo-Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Subcutaneous Injection through Use of Community Based Distributors in Zambia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Zambia has a relatively low modern contraceptive prevalence rate and high unmet need for family planning, reported at 45% and 21% respectively[1] .   In response to this, Society for Family Health (SFH) launched Sexual and Reproductive Health for All Initiative (SARAI) in 2015. As part of the global FP2020 effort, this five- year USAID-funded project aims to increase the modern contraceptive prevalence rate by 2% annually through increased access to quality voluntary family planning and reproductive health services. Injectable depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), the 3-month hormonal contraceptive, has been demonstrated to be highly effective and enjoys high rates of acceptance in Zambia, currently used by 13.8%[1] of all women who choose to use modern contraceptives. The recent introduction of a low-dose, subcutaneous injectable DMPA (DMPA-SC) presents additional opportunities to make this popular method available through a range of community-based channels, further improving access to voluntary family planning among female adolescents and women with unmet need.</p> <p>[1] Zambia Demgraphic Health Survey 2013/14</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>DMPA-SC is one of many modern contraceptive methods that SFH promotes to reduce unmet need for voluntary family planning in Zambia. DMPA-SC product currently in use in Zambia is Sayana Press®, which delivers a low hormonal dose injected subcutaneously in a disposable single-use dispensing system. Small, easy to use and requiring no refrigeration, the method is ideal for use through community-based distributors. SFH conducted a pilot intervention to assess the feasibility for community-based introduction and distribution of DMPA-SC in Zambia. The results from this pilot were used to inform plans for subsequent national scale-up.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>SFH’s pilot was implemented over a three-month period (May-July) in 2017. DMPA-SC was introduced through Community-based Distributors (CBDs) affiliated to 29 health facilities in three districts. A total of 161 CBDs received a comprehensive 3-day training in DMPA-SC which included counselling about the method, potential side effects and correct administration. All CBDs had previously received training in the provision of DMPA-IM. To strengthen technical proficiencies, each CBD was assigned to a health facility where he/she provided at least 5 DMPA SC injections under qualified clinical supervision before providing the method in the community. A standard injection supervision checklist was used to assess CBD competency in injection safety. Regular, post-training supportive supervision in the field was included as a key component of the pilot. This supervision focused on adherence to safety protocols, appropriate waste disposal practices and data management. Client service data was collected using standard MOH registers. In order to avoid commodity stock outs, each participating facility was provided with buffer stocks of DMPA-SC and CBDs were advised to re-order once 50% of stock on-hand was expended. In addition, all CBDs were supplied with stock tracking forms and were given lockable wooden boxes for storing commodities. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During the pilot 12,818 clients were provided with modern voluntary FP methods with 16.4% (2,100) opting for DMPA-SC. More than a third of clients 36.9% (4,728) were provided with male condoms. DMPA IM was provided to 31.9% (4,090) of clients. Combined oral contraceptive pills was distributed to 9.4% (1,202). Female condoms were distributed to 5.4% (698). The age range of clients opting for DMPA-SC was between 15 to 50 years, with an average of 31 years.  Slightly less than half (43%) of DMPA-SC clients were adolescents and young women, with 11% of these aged 15 – 19 and 32% aged 20 – 24.</p><p>Of all clients receiving FP methods from CBDs, nearly half (48%) received injectable contraceptives (either DMPA-IM or DMPA-SC). The number of DMPA doses administered after introduction of the DMPA-SC CBD pilot increased by 40%. On average, each CBD administered 5 doses of DMPA-SC per month. No adverse events were reported during or immediately subsequent to the introduction of DMPA-SC administration by CBDs.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study represents an important contribution to the literature on task-shifting and scale up of cost-effective FP innovations, particularly in low resource settings. The pilot demonstrated that CBDs can safely provide DMPA-SC at the community level with appropriate public sector coordination and oversight. Further, community-level distribution of DMPA-SC has the potential to improve access to voluntary family planning among adolescents and young women who may face unique barriers to obtaining these services through public sector facilities.  </p><p>The pilot provided valuable operational insights for future DMPA-SC scale-up initiatives such as the importance of having adequate human resources at each health facility to provide quality supportive supervision.  Also, how ensuring that a buffer stock of DMPA-SC is available at the district and facility is useful to reducing stock-outs. Well defined training curriculum and supervision systems are key to the successful scale up of DMPA SC into the existing FP distribution methods at community level.</p>",

      "title": "Lessons learned from a public sector community-based distribution program for scaling up DMPA-SC contraceptive services in Nigeria",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>DMPA-SC was introduced to the contraceptive method mix in Nigeria in 2015, primarily through private sector health service delivery channels. However, in the context of the mixed health system, public sector health services remain critical, particularly for lower income and medically-underserved communities as public sector contraceptives are heavily subsidized and free to users. From 2016-2017, under the coordination of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and implemented by three partnering NGOs, DMPA-SC was introduced to the contraceptive method mix in the public sector through state-run primary health care centers in targeted areas of 10 selected states.</p><p></p><p>Building on prior pilot experiences, the public sector scale-up of DMPA-SC relied heavily on a community-based distribution (CBD) service delivery model. Although implementation strategies within this model were purposefully varied across contexts and partners, the approach involved initial counseling and prescription by a trained and certified health provider (community health worker, nurse/midwife, or doctor) with reinjections delivered by trained lay community volunteers. This study presents findings from the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of this scale-up effort, the lessons learned, and implications for the further scaling of DMPA-SC in Nigeria through the public sector.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Reflecting the cultural and geopolitical diversity of Nigeria, the public sector DMPA-SC program was designed to assess the delivery of and receptivity to DMPA-SC as a component of the contraceptive method mix. Implementing partners coordinated the training of two service provision cadres: (1) health providers employed at primary health centers and lay volunteers primarily tasked with proactive community outreach, referrals to health providers for women’s initial counseling and method provision, and CBD of selected methods (condoms, pills, and DMPA-SC) for revisits.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The M&amp;E objectives for this program were to: (a) document variations in program implementation and key performance indicators across states and implementing partners; (b) identify the factors that facilitated or challenged program implementation and DMPA-SC uptake; and (c) synthesize the  lessons learned from this experience to inform future national scale-up.</p><p></p><p>Across the 10 program states (Abia, Akwa Ibom, Benue, Cross River, Ebonyi, FCT, Gombe, Kaduna, Kebbi, and Sokoto), standardized M&amp;E data collection tools were developed to track a core set of key performance indicators (KPIs) synthesized from different data sources: (1) internal program documents and reports from implementing partners and UNFPA coordinators; and (2) a family planning patient register for all client encounters that all recruited providers and volunteers were trained to use.</p><p></p><p>For program activities occurring from August 2016 through December 2017, we examined variations in KPIs across states and implementing partners within the context of differences in implementation environments, strategies, and activities. Patient-level register data were used to quantify the number and profile of women reached through the program (by age and previous contraceptive use), as well as methods delivered.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>With 3,912 trained service providers (approximately two-thirds were volunteers), the program reached 141,600 women. Although operations spanned 16 months, nearly half of women were reached during a two-month period, driven by a surge in CBD in two states (Kebbi and Gombe), where local governments were also highly supportive of the program, according to implementers. New users of modern contraception accounted for over 70% of all women reached in nearly all states, and exceeding 80% in some. Across methods, 78% of women received DMPA-SC and 16% male condoms; other methods accounted for smaller percentages.</p><p></p><p>Door-to-door outreach was deployed as a strategy to reach underserved women in more conservative Northern Nigerian states, where cultural norms often prevent women from leaving their homes. Outreach also overcame women’s concerns over receiving safe and confidential counseling. Implementers also reported success in shifting the description of the program away from family planning and birth spacing per se and towards “general health” for mothers and children, a strategy that reduced stigma and provided a foothold for engaging in dialogue about contraception.</p><p></p><p>In two states, relatively higher percentages of young women under age 20 were reached (10% in Akwa Ibom and 13% in Cross River, compared to 6% overall). To reach more youth, implementers used (a) focus group discussions with young women to inform outreach strategies, (b) more judicious screenings of providers (e.g. excluding those who expressed reluctance to provide contraceptive services to youth) and (c) recruited age-peer volunteers to conduct CBD in more private, youth-dense sites.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The implementation experience and the ability of the CBD outreach model to reach a large percentage of new users of modern contraception suggests that proactive service delivery can address some key barriers to accessing contraceptive information and services for many Nigerian women. In addition, a large portion of women opted for DMPA-SC among an array of contraceptive methods offered. This may not only reflect the larger popularity of injectable contraceptives in Nigeria, but also indicated that DMPA-SC’s features, coupled with CBD, may help fill specific gaps in women’s contraceptive needs.</p><p></p><p>Thus, including DMPA-SC among the contraceptive methods offered through public sector health services may ultimately reduce unmet need for contraception and help accelerate progress toward achieving Nigeria’s national reproductive health goals. However, delivering contraceptive services through CBD, which was fundamental for reaching underserved populations (e.g., younger women, those residing in conservative areas), may be a key element for advancing these efforts. This modality may be especially vital as a public sector complement to further expansion of DMPA-SC in private sector channels, capitalizing on the way in which private sector efforts raise awareness among the main consumer base for DMPA-SC and family planning in general. Specific strategies deployed for public sector DMPA-SC expansion should be tailored to local needs, but potentially incorporate tactics that include door-to-door engagement, use positive message framing, are informed by local members of target beneficiary groups, and that are sensitive to needs of younger women.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Improving access and utilization of family planning (FP) is a priority in Nepal with the government’s commitment to Family Planning 2020 and Sustainable Development Goal 3.7. However, the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey showed little recent change in modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) — 43% in 2011 and in 2016 —or unmet need — 28% in 2011, 24% in 2016 — among married women ages 15—49. Numerous factors hamper progress in FP, including inequity across ages, wealth quintiles and geographies. Women who are young, rural, and poor struggle to access quality FP services due to limited government facilities and a shortage of skilled service providers and supplies, mainly of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods. The mCPR is lower in rural areas than urban areas (40.6% versus 44.2%). Unmet need is highest among younger (33% among women 15—24 years) and poorer women (27% in the lowest wealth quintile, 20% in the highest). To help address these gaps, Sunaulo Parivar Nepal, implementing partner of Marie Stopes International, launched the Marie Stopes (MS) Ladies channel, consisting of local mobile auxiliary nurse-midwives (ANM) providing FP services to vulnerable women in remote and hard-to-reach districts who otherwise have limited or no access.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The MS Ladies programme seeks to use a community-based approach to address the inequities in access to FP services. MS Ladies are local ANMs providing community-based, easily accessible and quality-assured contraception from their homes or in their communities. This service channel takes FP services to marginalized women living in remote areas, who otherwise must travel for days through rugged terrain to obtain FP services. The MS Ladies work closely with local community health workers to generate demand and expand access to a wider choice of FP methods to women in these rural communities.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The MS Ladies programme started in October 2015 with eight ANMs in four districts and had expanded to 39 in 12 districts by the end of 2017. The districts and areas where they work were selected, after consultation with local government, based on need and lack of availability of other FP services, especially for LARC.</p><p>We analyzed MS Ladies service data from January to December 2017 to assess uptake of services and FP method mix. Also, we conducted client interviews in November 2017 to examine client’s characteristics such as age, history of FP use, poverty status (using the Progress Out of Poverty Index) and access to FP to measure how well we are reaching marginalized populations. The survey also looked at clients’ perception of quality and their satisfaction with the services. We interviewed 107 randomly selected clients who received services from the MS Ladies either at home or in the communities for the exit interviews. We used the structured questionnaire from the MSI standard client exit interview (CEI) survey protocol. We analyzed the data descriptively using SPSS v22.0.  </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, in 2017, 39 MS Ladies provided FP services to 6,867 clients —6,755 women (98%) and 112 men (2%). Among them, 82% received LARC methods; the great majority chose implants (78%) over IUDs (4%). Some 12% of clients chose injectables, and the remaining 6% chose condoms or pills. CEI results showed that more than one-third (37%) of interviewed clients had not used any FP method in the preceding three months, while 40% were switching from a short-term to a long-term method. Nearly one-third (31%) were under age 25 years, and 7% were adolescents (under age 19 years). Almost two-thirds (65%) were living on less than US$2.50 a day, with 15% living on less than $1.25 a day. Over one-third (36%) had no formal education. One-quarter (26%) reported that they did not have access to another facility for their chosen contraceptive method. Most clients (80%) travelled less than an hour to receive service; more than 50% clients who did have access to another provider would have had to travel more than an hour to reach that other provider. The score on the FP2020 method information index, used to assess quality of counselling for the channel, was 82%. The great majority of clients (92%) were satisfied with their overall experience. All clients reported that the MS Ladies exceeded their expectation and that they would recommend the MS Ladies to their friends and family.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The MS Ladies channel is the first programme of its kind to take the service provider into the community, actively creating awareness and providing access to FP services in the rugged Himalayas and hilly regions of Nepal. The findings show that MS Ladies have been very successful in providing access to FP, especially LARC services, which otherwise are rarely available in rural areas due to the need for skilled providers and adequate equipment and facilities. The MS Ladies are providing, for the most part, access to implants largely to women who had been using no method or a short-term method. CEIs showed that the MS Ladies have succeeded in addressing previously underserved populations such as youth, the poor and those without access to other providers. The high levels of client satisfaction and strong FP 2020 method index scores indicate that, despite working outside of health facilities in challenging conditions, they are providing high-quality services and enabling women to make informed FP decisions. The results indicate that mobilizing community providers can play a major role in going the last mile to reach the unreached and help reduce the unmet need for FP. Following the success of the program, the channel will be scaled up to provide services in17 districts through 50 MS Ladies in 2018.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>With the goal of improving maternal and child health, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Madagascar committed in 2015 to increase the country’s modern contraceptive prevalence rate (MCPR) from 33% in 2012 to 50% in 2020. However, a threat to the achievement of this FP2020 commitment is the critical shortage of health providers, especially in rural areas. In Madagascar, nearly two-thirds of the population is rural. Contraceptive use is substantially lower in rural areas (37% MCPR) as compared to urban areas (51% MCPR) (ENS/OMD 2012-2013).</p><p></p><p>Task sharing with community health workers (CHWs) is a promising strategy to expand contraceptive coverage, make access more equitable, and utilize health workers’ skills cost-effectively. CHW programs are considered a High Impact Practice by USAID, especially in places like Madagascar with geographic barriers to health services. Furthermore, a new type of injectable product – subcutaneous injectables (DMPA-SC) known by Pfizer’s brand name Sayana Press – can be safely and easily administered by CHWs.</p><p></p><p>In 2015, the MOH decided to introduce DMPA-SC—including community-based provision—to increase women’s options.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The MOH, PSI/Madagascar, and technical partners introduced DMPA-SC starting in 2015. The national pilot strategy included two distribution channels selected to optimize the use of resources: the public sector through basic health centers, and the community channel through CHWs. The MOH included the community-level channel—managed by non-governmental organizations—in order to diversify the range of contraceptive methods available to rural women who otherwise struggled to access any methods other than male condoms and oral contraceptive pills.</p><p></p><p>Although studies in several other countries show that DMPA-SC can be self-administered, self-injection is yet not part of the Madagascar MOH's strategy.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Community-based distribution (CBD) of DMPA-SC began in November 2015 in four regions of Madagascar with support from PSI. With the support of multiple partners, CBD soon scaled up to all 22 regions. PSI/Madagascar supplied the Community Supply Points, which directly distribute the product to CHWs. CHWs were given the capacity to provide short-term modern contraceptives in rural areas located more than 5 km from Basic Health Centers.</p><p></p><p>Following the introduction, PSI/Madagascar conducted an evaluation of the acceptability of DMPA-SC among women, CHWs, and health providers.  The main objectives of this evaluation were to assess clients' perceptions of DMPA-SC, to examine the motivators and barriers that clients or service providers raise in relation to its use, to evaluate the acceptability among clients of potentially replacing DMPA-IM with DMPA-SC, and to evaluate the acceptability among social franchise providers of a potential introduction of DMPA-SC at their level. A qualitative study was conducted including in-depth interviews with 31 clients, three public sector providers, five social franchise providers, and 16 CHWs.</p><p></p><p>In 2017, PSI/Madagascar conducted a household survey to be used as the national reference to estimate MCPR, including DMPA-SC use, as well as unmet need.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Since its introduction, PSI-Madagascar distributed 881 202 units of DMPA-SC despite frequent stockouts at the national level. The national survey conducted in 2017 showed that the national CPR is 38.9% among women in union aged 15-49. The most commonly used method is injectables—at 20.4%—which includes DMPA-SC (1.4% of injectable users). The prevalence of DMPA-SC use in Madagascar is expected to continue growing as DMPA-SC becomes more fully integrated into the health system.</p><p></p><p>The DMPA-SC acceptability assessment conducted in May 2016 showed that current users found the new product to be attractive, innovative, and easy to use. Users also reported that it causes less pain during the injection. Client concerns included fears of the side effects (e.g. irregular periods), false beliefs and misconceptions (e.g. damage to uterus), and mistrust of the effectiveness of the product. Almost all providers and CHWs rejected the idea of self-injection because it was perceived to be unsuitable in rural areas where the health system would be less able to support correct and safe self-injection.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This program shows that task-sharing of DMPA-SC in such low-income countries as Madagascar can expand the range of quality family planning services accessible to clients, advance countries towards FP2020 goals, and potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems. By applying a social marketing approach to community-based distribution, this program motivated community health workers to serve more clients within the context of informed choice.</p><p></p><p>A factor contributing to the success of the DMPA-SC introduction in Madagascar thus far has been market segmentation and coordination among key market actors and facilitators. For example, UNFPA provides commodities for the public sector and USAID provides commodities for the NGOs working on community-based distribution. To enhance sustainability, financing sources should come not only from donors, but also from the national budget line in the Family Planning national strategic plan, with a 5% increase per year of the national budget for family planning.</p><p></p><p>However, integration and scale-up of such high impact interventions as DMPA-SC can only happen if local and international partners work synergistically with governments to integrate this new method through innovative service delivery strategies within national family planning programs. Some challenges need immediate attention in Madagascar. For example, DMPA-SC is not yet included in the MOH’s community data collection tools list, causing quantification and reporting gaps. In addition, successful scale-up will require advocacy for the inclusion of DMPA-SC in the national health information system, expansion of access through key distribution channels (CBD, private sector, and pharmacies), all while ensuring quality of counseling and services.  </p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) indicates use of modern methods of contraception is 35%, and there is high unmet need for family planning (FP).  Further, there is a high fertility prevalence among women in rural areas, and 25 percent of adolescents aged 15-19 years in Uganda have already begun childbearing. The relatively low use of contraception contributes to high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, unplanned pregnancy, and fertility.</p><p>To increase access to contraceptives and reduce unmet need for family planning, Marie Stopes Uganda (MSU) adopted a Marie Stopes (MS) Ladies model, an innovative, scalable, low cost model designed to overcome challenges of accessing high quality health care in Uganda.  </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The MS Ladies model supports nurses and/or midwives in peri- urban areas to expand their service delivery. This model intends to increase knowledge of and uptake of modern contraceptive choices among women and adolescent girls. MS Ladies in Uganda move door to door, delivering a full range of contraceptives and high-quality counseling to women and adolescent girls in the communities they live in.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>MSU first implemented the MS Ladies model of service delivery in January 2017.  We targeted nurses or mid-wives who were already working in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service delivery in 12 districts, spread across the four different regions of Uganda. Fifty MS Ladies were recruited and provided with training, which took place over 13days, in the following clinical and non-clinical areas: Fp procedures skills, clients’ counseling and follow up on FP, clients’ mobilization and demand creation, business skills, Infection prevention, documentation and reporting, stock management, emergency management and referral.  After the training, the MS Ladies were provided with equipment, such as sterilizers, IUCD and implants insertion and removal kits, roll up portable beds, back packs, emergency bags, counseling choice kits, FP leaf lets and data capture tools as well as FP commodities. </p><p>This training and equipment is vital to establishing community level businesses to deliver high quality SRH services and information, at an affordable price and in a manner that is private and convenient for women in the community. Routine service statistics on basic demographics such as age, and service use, are collected random sample of N=181 MS Ladies clients in November 2017, to collect information on detailed demographics,</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In 2017, the first cohort of 50 MS Ladies delivered a total of 7,448 contraceptive methods (implants, inter-uterine devices (IUDs), oral contraceptive pills, injectables, and emergency contraception pills (EC)).  This comprised 22% of MSU’s overall clients in 2017.</p><p>Client exit interview results showed that MS Ladies clients were often young, with 10% of clients aged 15-19 and 35% were 20-24.  Half (48%) of clients were adopters of FP.  Satisfaction with MS Ladies services was high, with 87% of clients reporting they would be very likely to recommend an MS Lady to a friend, and 98% of clients reporting that their expectations were exceeded.</p><p>Exit interview results also showed that MS Ladies were providing quality information and counselling, with 84% of clients reporting they received information on their FP method’s side effects, and 89% reporting they received follow-up instructions in case something went wrong.  However, just 59% of clients reported being counselled on an alternative method of FP, and the overall Method Information Index (MII) score for MS Ladies was 51%.  </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The MS Ladies model of service delivery in Uganda has begun to demonstrate value in expanding access to contraceptive information, services and choice to women in Uganda.  Part of the uniqueness of this model is that, unlike many other community-based health care workers, MS Ladies are highly trained and skilled and able to provide a wide variety of both FP information and services.</p><p>Our 2017 pilot with MS Ladies has highlighted that this model is working to expand contraceptive access, as almost half of MS Ladies clients were adopters of FP, an important cohort to reach given that this is the group that contributes to an increase in a country’s contraceptive prevalence.  Nearly half of MS Ladies clients were under the age of 25, although just 10% were adolescents, a key priority group for MSU to reach with information and services, and potentially highlighting an area where more work can be done going forwards.  Finally, client satisfaction with MS Ladies was quite high, but more training and work should be done to ensure that women are provided with counselling on alternative FP methods.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Resources for development are limited, and advocates must constantly work to ensure that family planning continues to attract the increasing financial resources needed to provide modern contraception to a growing number of women of reproductive age who want to avoid pregnancy. Advocates have characterized family planning as a “best buy” for development as a strong argument for funding family planning, and the argument is based on various analyses that have estimated family planning’s return on investment. These estimates have been based on different approaches to assessing the costs and benefits of providing family planning and have looked at different scales – sometimes focusing on single countries and sometimes looking more broadly at all developing countries.  Different approaches assess different scenarios, look at different time frames, use different assumptions, and measure different outcomes. Over the last several years, wide-ranging estimates of family planning’s return on investment have created confusion among advocates, who may not understand why estimates differ so greatly. To address this confusion, FP2020 organized a retreat of experts and advocates who measure and communicate family planning’s return on investment to assess actions they can take to overcome this challenge. This presentation will discuss the outcomes and their recommendations.          </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In 2016, FP2020 embarked on an effort to measure the economic value add of FP2020’s goal of enabling 120 additional women and girls in the world’s poorest countries to use voluntary modern contraception.  Various methodologies were used to measure the economic impact of the FP2020 acceleration in contraceptive use. Ultimately, FP2020 determined that a more valuable activity for the family planning community would be to bring together experts for discussion and alignment rather than add another figure to the already widely ranging estimates (one dollar of family planning invested returning anywhere from two dollars to 120 dollars in returns). </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Family planning partners spent two days examining different approaches used to measure family planning’s return on investment.  These approaches included different scenarios of contraceptive use and/or population change, different ways of estimating the costs of contraception, different timescales for measuring the benefits (short vs. long term) different geographies (national vs. regional/global) and different types of outcomes (dollars saved vs. economic gains).  The group also examined hybrid approaches of looking across a multitude of these dimensions.  Specific approaches reviewed included: Guttmacher’s Adding It Up, the Health Policy Project’s assessment of the contribution of fulfilling unmet need for family planning on the Millennium Development Goals, the DemDiv model, economic analysis using the World Bank’s Linkages model to assess the impact of different contraceptive growth scenarios, and the Copenhagen Consensus analysis.  Each of these approaches was examined to better understand common or different assumptions, and the methodologies were mapped graphically for better understanding.  In addition, the assumptions and scenarios used for each approach were reviewed and compared to identify areas for possible group consensus and recommendations.  These areas included alignment on costing, best practices for contraception and fertility scenarios, preferred outcome measures, and improved communication of results.       </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The Family Planning Return on Investment Retreat, scheduled for April 24-25th, is particularly important this year due to the 2018 International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP) theme: <strong>Investing for a Lifetime of Returns</strong>.  While the meeting had not yet taken place at the date of this abstract submission, FP2020 had already communicated to various stakeholders about the meeting, including ICFP conference organizers, FP2020’s Core Conveners, FP2020’s Performance Monitoring and Evidence Working Group, and others. We expect that key results from this meeting will include a joint commentary on measuring family planning’s return on investment, a graphic explaining the different approaches and estimates of family planning’s cost to benefit ratio, and recommendations for future efforts to assess and communicate family planning as a best buy.  FP2020 will aim to communicate these findings through various channels ahead of and during the ICFP, and this presentation is intended to provide a space to report on the expert working group findings during the conference.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Family planning is a best buy, but our efforts to advocate for family planning need to be supported by strong evidence and clear and consistent communications.  Varying messages on family planning’s return on investment undermine our advocacy and communications.  As we aim to secure the resources and attention needed to achieve FP2020 goals by 2020 and the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, we should continue to make an economic case for family planning.  The findings from this presentation will help advocates discern the differences between different cost-benefit analyses, and thus help them communicate more effectively, choosing the appropriate approach and measure for the appropriate audience.  In addition, the recommendations from the expert group will help guide future analysis aimed at estimating the lifetime of returns to be gained from investing in family planning. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p><em>The relationship between population growth and economic well-being is not a new topic. Among policymakers, a growing enthusiasm for the potential economic benefits of the so-called “demographic dividend” has been gaining prominence in recent years.  There are several definitions of the demographic dividend, but the basic concept is that changes in a population’s size and age distribution can lead to favorable benefits to a country’s economic growth. This result is often qualified with other supporting policies being in place such as girls’ education, favorable macro-economic policies and public transparency. The demographic dividend concept is useful primarily for advocacy purposes to show the economic benefits of demographic transitions primarily engendered by family planning. So, the size of the dividend is important when communicating with decision makers.</em></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p><em>This paper will address the question of to how to measure the demographic dividend because how it is measured will affect its magnitude and its magnitude is important in informing policy dialogue. The most common metric in the literature has been to compare changes in GDP per capita between scenarios. But using a per capita measure can exaggerate the potential gain because of the reductions in population size in the denominator. Other measurement issues include which indicator is best, the time period during which measurement takes place, and which counterfactual or scenarios should be used to measure the dividend.</em></p>",
      "methodology": "<p><em>We studied these measurement issues by using the DemDiv simulation model to estimate alternative metrics of the demographic dividend. The model has been applied in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Applications of the model show that fertility reduction has a favorable impact on the economy as measured by GDP per capita, but the size and time profile of the impact depends on the country’s initial conditions as well as complementary policies in education, governance and the economy. We ran the model for six sub-Saharan African countries under similar simulations. Alternative indicators included GDP per capita, consumption per capita, the growth rate of GDP per capita, the growth rate of consumption per capita, the level of GDP and GDP growth rate, and cumulative GDP change. We also considered different time periods. Finally, because it has been suggested that education, governance and economic policies are important facilitating factors for a demographic dividend to be realized (in addition to changes in fertility), we looked at alternative scenarios (defined by changes in these facilitating factors) when measuring the dividend. </em></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary (and incomplete) results for six sub-Saharan African countries with the model comparing a “business-as-usual” fertility scenario with a scenario in which fertility declines rapidly, indicate that lower levels of fertility universally increase per capita GDP in the final simulation year as well as increase the growth rate of GDP per capita. We also see cumulative GDP increases over the simulation period. Differences in the level of GDP in the final year vary in magnitude significantly however, from differences in per capita GDP. The same is true for cumulative GDP differences. The paper will extend these results to compare other simulations that include supporting policy changes as well as time period effects. We will produce a topology of demographic dividend estimates for alternative indicators, time frames and comparative scenarios.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The paper contributes to the perennial issue of how changes in population may affect economic growth in general and to the demographic dividend dialogue in particular. By studying not only alternative measurements of the dividend as well as other factors such as the time frame in which measurement takes place, which scenarios to compare, and presenting these, researchers, advocates and policy makers will be able to make appropriate choices regarding the potential size of a demographic dividend in their own situations. Recommendations will be made on which way the demographic dividend should be measured depending on the use of the calculation and audience.</p>",

      "title": "The Four Dividends: How Age Structure Change Benefits Child Survival, Educational Attainment, Income, and Political Stability",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Policymakers in high-fertility countries have shown increasing interest in the potential economic benefits of future changes in population age structure, typically described as the demographic dividend. While this renewed attention to the connections between population and development is welcome, framing the dividend in purely economic terms obscures broader effects of fertility decline and age-structural change. This paper revises the classical, narrow economic view of the demographic dividend by hypothesizing social, political, and additional economic components, statistically quantifying their age-structural relationships, and then testing the validity of those hypothesized relationships.</p><p>We argue for extending the demographic dividend’s narrative beyond its acknowledged impacts on per-capita income to encompass three additional development benefits—in child survival, educational attainment, and political stability—for which there is evidence of linkages to the age-structural transition. We demonstrate that countries cannot reach specific age-structural thresholds at which these benefits become likely until fertility declines substantially, driven by increased use of voluntary family planning. With a better understanding of the potential benefits of age structure change across four key development sectors, policymakers can effectively channel investments in family planning and other programs to promote a demographic transition and achieve development goals.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Our objective is to develop and test the concept of “four dividends,” statistically linking discrete levels of improvement in child survival, educational attainment, per capita income, and political stability to specific periods of the demographic transition. We transform the “demographic window” for these dividends, previously defined by the proportions of children and seniors, to upper and lower boundaries measured in median age. Finally, we aim to identify specific points in the age structure transition at which countries become at least 50 percent likely to achieve each of the four dividend benefits.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Our analysis employs a demographically-focused construct of logistic regression modeling called an age-structural model, which is designed to produce its output on the age-structural time domain. We measure the age structure transition using population median age, a simple scalar variable easily understood by non-demographers. To model the “four dividend” transitions, we disaggregated each of the transitions into a set of progressively successional categories, generating a full or partial logistic function for each of these categories between median ages of 15 and 46 years.</p><p>Data for the four dividend transitions were obtained from publicly available sources and aggregated into categories. We defined the four dividend transitions as: under-five mortality (UN Population Division data), late-secondary educational enrollment (UNESCO data), GNI per capita (World Bank’s income categories), and frequency of civil conflict (Uppsala-PRIO Conflict Dataset). To generate full and partial logistic functions for each category, we ran multivariate logistic regressions using population median age as the only continuous independent variable, with three dichotomous controls: small population size, occurrence of high-intensity conflict, and significant levels of oil and mineral rents. The resulting functions describe a range (Y-axis) of probabilities of being within a given “dividend” category at all median ages (X-axis).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The demographic dividend is often framed as a relatively long window of opportunity lasting several decades. Our calculations indicate that the window is associated with median ages between 26 and 41 years. Countries’ statistical likelihood of achieving each categorical level of development across the four dividends exceeds 50 percent at various median ages.</p><p>During the child survival transition, populations become more than 50 percent likely to realize an under-five mortality rate of less than or equal to 25 deaths per 1,000 live births at a median age of 29 years. For educational attainment, late-secondary enrollment rates at or above 60 percent become likely early in the demographic window, with a 50 percent likelihood associated with a median age of 25 years. During the income transition, the realization of upper-middle income status becomes more than 50 percent likely at a median age of 31 years.</p><p>Unlike the other three dividend transitions, the political stability function was found to be a relatively poor fit to logistic regression, which reflects the fact that advances in political stability—measured by the frequency of civil conflict—have not been irreversible. Still, civil conflict is more prevalent in countries with youthful age structures. As median age rises, the number of conflicts likely to be experienced per decade falls, and at a median age of 21, countries are 50% likely to have zero conflicts in a given decade.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Grouping health, education, economic, and political benefits of age structural change can attract support for demographic program interventions from decisionmakers across the four sectors. Perhaps even more important, given frequent rhetoric trumpeting the demographic dividend as a foregone conclusion, our findings indicate that three development benefits that are desirable to most policymakers have historically only been attained once a country’s median age matures well into the demographic window of opportunity. Specifically, countries moving through the demographic window can be expected to attain: the upper-middle category of educational attainment (greater than 60 percent enrollment in late-secondary school) at a median age of 25 years; the upper-middle category of child survival (under-five mortality of less than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births) at a median age of 29 years; and upper-middle income status at a median age of 31 years.</p><p>Countries that achieve these “dividends” earlier than statistically expected tend to have extenuating factors such as very small populations or a high proportion of natural resource rents. Therefore, the majority of countries that are just entering the demographic window of opportunity—those with median ages less than 26 years—should prioritize progress through the age-structural transition to improve child survival and reduce fertility by promoting the planning and spacing of births through voluntary family planning.</p>",

      "title": "To what extent can family planning boost achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals? Introducing the FP-SDGs Model and regional results",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consist of an ambitious set of 17 goals, 169 targets, and 232 associated indicators focused on global development aspirations that countries commit to achieving by 2030. One important SDG target is achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health, including contraceptive information, education, and services. Family planning (FP) is one of the smartest SDG priorities, with sweeping social, economic, and environmental benefits, in addition to being a highly cost-effective intervention.</p><p>While the benefits of FP use are well-documented, the expansive nature of the SDGs poses a challenge for in-country prioritization and implementation of FP programs. Stakeholders lack local evidence on the extent to which investing in FP can impact the achievement of other SDGs at the country level. In light of competing financial and programmatic priorities, as well as a changing international aid landscape, quantifying the effects of FP on the SDGs will support national decision making and help channel investments toward the most cost-effective interventions.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>To what extent will an increase in contraceptive use impact 13 SDG indicators across select countries in sub-Saharan Africa? We hypothesize that increasing contraceptive use over time will accelerate improvements in SDG indicators above and beyond gains that would be achieved through socioeconomic/development strategies alone.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The USAID-funded Health Policy Plus (HP+) project developed the Family Planning-Sustainable Development Goals (FP-SDGs) Model, enabling users to simulate effects of FP use, through its impact on demography, on various SDG indicators through 2030 or 2050. These SDG indicators include population living in poverty; food insecurity; children’s reading proficiency; water/sanitation; GDP per capita growth rate; child labor; slum dwelling; child stunting; maternal and under-five mortality; adolescent birth rate; and others. Model relationships linking FP/demographic variables and other socioeconomic factors (predictors) to SDG indicators (response variables) were established using ordinary least squares estimation and structural equation modeling, both of which were informed by an extensive literature review.</p><p>The FP-SDGs Model was applied in Malawi in collaboration with government stakeholders who developed three comparison scenarios by varying the expected modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) by 2050. Scenarios included: 1) maintaining 45% mCPR, 2) reaching Malawi’s FP goal of 60% mCPR by 2020, with no increase thereafter, and 3) attaining 68% mCPR. For education, governance, economic growth, and agriculture variables, stakeholders set values for each scenario aligned with Malawi achieving upper-middle income country status by 2050. The model will also be applied in additional geographies, including the nine West African Ouagadougou Partnership countries.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Model results illustrate that an increase in family planning use (SDG indicator 3.7.1) positively impacts SDG indicators across sectors. If Malawi reaches the most ambitious stakeholder-identified FP goals by 2050—while maintaining other socioeconomic improvements—the country could experience gains significantly above and beyond those that would be achieved in a scenario where FP usage does not change. By pursuing an ambitious FP path, Malawi could reduce 1) the prevalence of food insecurity by 51%; 2) the urban population living in slums by 88%; 3) the number of people living in poverty by 25%; 4) the maternal mortality ratio by 48%; and 5) the under-five mortality rate by 66%. In addition, meeting FP goals by 2050 would increase 1) the percentage of primary-school children achieving reading proficiency by 25%; 2) the percentage of the population using improved drinking water services to 100% at a faster rate; and 3) the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita by 77%. Therefore, SDG targets are most likely to be met under a future scenario in which FP is prioritized by both public and private sectors in Malawi, creating an enabling environment for FP use. While the health sector must provide leadership on the delivery of FP services, ensuring that these services are available and accessible to all Malawians requires a coordinated approach across sectors.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Quantifying the boost FP offers to the SDGs helps make the case for multisectoral investments and coordination in contraceptive information, education, and services. Countries have much to gain by further investing in FP, as increasing FP use benefits development across sectors. While socioeconomic reforms will contribute to the achievement of SDG targets and goals, combining such reforms with family planning investments will provide the greatest impact.</p><p>Countries will be better positioned to achieve the SDGs if decision-makers across sectors understand the degree to which FP can accelerate progress toward achieving specific SDGs. This information can then help decision-makers choose to prioritize FP accordingly and emphasize coordination across ministries to promote collaboration at policy, funding, programmatic, and community levels. FP-SDGs Model results help countries make the case for this coordinated approach to improve access to and use of quality FP services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Since mid-2016, Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK) has run a holistic, multi-component intervention including demand- and supply-side elements to encourage adolescent uptake of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services – Future Fab/Choice for Change (FF/C4C). The aspirational lifestyle brand ‘Future Fab’ was developed through a Hewlett Foundation-funded human-centred design process with IDEO.org and implemented by MSK under the Children’s Investment Fund-funded Choice4Change project. FF/C4C includes a holistic three-step process: 1. Activate (community dialogues and events to raise awareness), 2. Engage (smaller parent and teen meet-ups to address concerns and provide in-depth information), and 3. Deliver (youth-friendly service delivery including removal of supply-side barriers such as cost). Adolescent clients are supported throughout their engagement journey by a network of youth-friendly mobilisers. FF/C4C was conducted in two phases: the ‘Implementation’ phase focused on ‘Activating’ and ‘Engaging’. The ‘Refinement’ phase included fewer demand-generation events and more pop-up service ‘Delivery’. The shift of focus aimed to adapt the programme to capitalise on the awareness and acceptance generated under the Implementation phase and support adolescents to move through the behaviour change process towards contraceptive trial and continuation. FF/C4C has delivered highly promising results and lessons learned that could inform other adolescent SRH interventions in the sector.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In August 2017, Marie Stopes Kenya and Marie Stopes International collaborated to conduct an evaluation of the programme using routine Client Information Centre (CLIC) data, triangulated with MSK workplans and marketing trackers, to estimate the impact of the programme on adolescent attendance.</p><p>We aimed to answer the following questions:</p>\t<li>What impact has FF/C4C had on adolescent attendance?</li>\t<li>Has the nature of this impact changed over time as the programme has evolved?</li>\t<li>Who was FF/C4C most effective in reaching and which services were most popular?</li>\t<li>What elements of MSK’s intervention were effective in bringing clients to services?</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>FF/C4C was rolled out to MSK’s 23 clinics across Kenya between July 2016 and March 2017. Routine CLIC client data from January 2016 to August 2017 from 21 of the 23 clinics was analysed to estimate the impact of each of the intervention phases on adolescent client attendance for family planning and sexually transmitted infection services.</p><p>The routine CLIC dataset contained data from 106,076 client visits, including 20,571 visits by clients who were under 20 at the time of their visit. Data was analysed using STATA 14.</p><p>Analysis methods included using descriptive statistics of client profiles, source of marketing/referral, and proportion and number of adolescent clients per clinic over the intervention phases.</p><p>We also conducted an interrupted time-series (ITS) model per clinic, controlling for background trends in attendance, and allowing for a step-change at the Implementation phase starting point and a slope-change at the Refinement phase starting point, based on our hypothesis of how the phases might affect adolescent attendance.</p><p>We then meta-analysed the coefficients from the ITS models to estimate an overall odds ratio for the start of each intervention phase across clinics.

      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Between the start of FF/C4C and August 2017, MSK saw 18,420 client visits by clients under 20 across the 21 clinics. The average number of adolescent client visits per clinic per week increased almost seven-fold between baseline and the Implementation and Refinement phases (from 3 to 13 and 20), and the proportion of client visits by adolescents more than tripled from 7% to 21% and 26%.</p><p>Meta-analysis of ITS coefficients across clinics showed the odds of adolescent attendance at the start of the Implementation phase doubled on average (Overall OR: 2.09, CI:1.42-3.06), despite significant heterogeneity (I-squared= 70.7%, p<p>Future Fab effectively increased access to FP/STI services among adolescents, but not at the expense of MSK’s adult clients (monthly growth rate 12% for under 20s compared to 3% for clients 20 and over).</p><p>Sixty-four per cent of adolescent clients seen through FF/C4C were both unmarried and pre-childbearing. Implants were by far the most popular service. Eighty-eight per cent were new clients to MSK in the Implementation phase and 92% were during the Refinement phase.</p><p>74% and 83% of adolescent clients in the Implementation and Refinement phases had had at least some contact with a Future Fab event or mobiliser. 63% of adolescent clients in both phases reported both attending an event and referral by a mobiliser.</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>FF/C4C shows that adolescents can be effectively reached with SRH services at scale through holistic models addressing both demand- and supply-side barriers.</p><p>The meta-analyses indicate significant heterogeneity between clinics, making a true estimate of the effect difficult. This could be due to the context-tailored and iterative nature of the intervention, meaning that the roll-out and shift in phases of FF/C4C looked different in different clinics, as well as variation in county-level and community buy-in across the country, and, in some clinics, overlaps with other interventions.</p><p>However, on average MSK doubled their odds of adolescent attendance right from the start of the Implementation phase, and sustained their positive trend in adolescent attendance during the Refinement phase, despite the shift to less demand-generation and more pop-up service delivery. MSK is undertaking further analysis to optimise elements of the intervention and identify the most cost-effective way to sustain high adolescent attendance going forward.</p>",

      "title": "More than fun and games - Expansion of community games to address fertility awareness, family planning, and social norms in Nepal",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Increases in Nepal’s contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) have stagnated in the past decade and comparisons between actual and desired fertility rates are complicated by increased use of emergency contraception, abortion, and spousal separation due to labor migration. Unmet need is highest among married women aged 15-19 and 20-24, at 34.9% and 32.6%, respectively (NDHS 2016) and is especially high among the Muslim, Janajati, and Dalit ethnic groups who experience cultural and geographic barriers in accessing health services. Formative research conducted across five districts in Nepal revealed that the high unmet need and low family planning (FP) use were driven by 1) individuals having limited knowledge about fertility and FP; 2) men and women having misconceptions about FP methods side effects; and 3) social norms negatively affecting couples decision-making around birth timing and family size. Existing FP programs and messages traditionally target women as potential FP users, but providing accurate information about fertility and FP to the wider community, through multisector platforms, to dispel misconceptions and build supportive normative environments for women could address some of the barriers to FP use, especially among hard-to-reach (HTR) minority groups.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The USAID-funded Fertility Awareness for Community Transformation project developed a series of nine interactive games, called Pragati, that provide information about fertility and FP, and encourage reflection about social norms. The project trained select community health workers and community members as promoters to play the games with groups of men, women, and youth in HTR communities, introducing them to FP information by initiating discussions about men and women’s fertility and social norms.  Designed as stand-alone tools for easy replication, Pragati can be used by both literate and low-literate promoters to discuss FP topics in group settings.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Working through existing community platforms, the project implemented the Pragati games in five districts of Nepal from January 2017 to March 2018, targeting HTR minority groups. Implemented as both a research and intervention project, FACT investigated a primary hypothesis that increased fertility awareness, defined as actionable information about one’s own fertility, improves FP use. Monitoring data collected by community promoters tracked the demographics of game participants and the types of community platforms where games were played to assess the number of contact points made and the profile of community beneficiaries.</p><p></p><p>In each district, 18 village development committees (VDCs) were selected and randomly assigned to one of three research arms: one intervention group receiving fertility and FP information, a comparison group receiving just FP information, and a control group with no intervention. Baseline and end line household surveys (n= 3645) assessed intervention effectiveness at reaching HTR communities, diffusing information, and improving fertility awareness and FP-use in intervention sites compared to control sites. Qualitative focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with a sample of community members, community leaders, health providers, and promoters were also conducted at end line to assess participant experience and assess feasibility of scale-up.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Final evaluation results about the intervention’s reach and impact will be available in August 2018. Preliminary qualitative and program monitoring data indicate that youth and adults showed active interest and engagement in the Pragati games.  In total, more than 75,000 community contacts were generated through game play. The fertility and social norms games were played most often due to interest in the information and discussions on how FP can support better health and economic outcomes for families.. The games were played across various community platforms, including Health Mothers’ Groups (n=1887 sessions), adolescent groups and youth clubs (n=667), agricultural groups (n=238), and schools (n= 98), showing that the content can be integrated into various platforms and has mass appeal.</p><p></p><p>Implementing the Pragati package does not require significant resources other than printing of game materials, and most individuals with basic literacy can follow the game instructions. While regular coaching was required to properly support low-literate promoters, those who could read instructions needed less coaching to facilitate discussions. To achieve wider reach and impact, the project also trained teachers and staff from local programs to play and incorporate the games into their programs. Facilitators with a basic understanding of health topics easily adopted the games and did not need additional coaching. Subsequently, various implementing organizations in Nepal have committed to integrating and playing the games through their platforms to generate demand for FP. Local municipality bodies have also made budgetary commitments to support promoters to continue playing the games in their communities.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>While forthcoming final evaluation findings will quantify the added value of the Pragati games, experience confirms that men, women, and youth alike are interested in learning about fertility and FP. Discussing these taboo topics through the participatory format of the Pragati games delivers information in a sensible manner, engages participants in learning about their bodies, and helps dispel misconceptions about FP. A key component of the games, which is also a challenging piece, is the facilitation of critical reflection, which is essential to help participants connect the game content to their own lives and desires. This was particularly challenging for low-literate promoters with the social and gender norms-focused games, as they themselves may have the same attitudes and biases that are being re-examined. Adequate training and coaching support for low-literate promoters is required to implement the games properly. Nevertheless, literate facilitators, such as secondary school teachers, are able to lead the games and critical discussions with basic training in the games.</p><p></p><p>Program experience showed that integration of the games into health and non-health programs with literate community facilitators is feasible and mutually beneficial for programs that seek to either improve FP uptake or address social norms related to gender and reproductive health issues, such as gender-based violence, early marriage, and son preference. The practice of community game playing offers a viable solution for interventions that aim to promote fertility awareness and increase discussion around social norms in order to improve family planning use.</p>",

      "title": "Normative Influences on Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health in Rural Madagascar: A Conceptual Model Synthesizing Findings from a Qualitative Study  ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Between 1992 and 2008, Madagascar’s contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) increased from 17 percent to 40 percent and the total fertility rate (TFR) decreased from 6.1 to 4.8 children per woman of reproductive age (WRA). Despite encouraging progress in reproductive health (RH), unmet need for family planning (FP) among Malagasy women remains at 19 percent and urban/rural RH-related disparities exist (DHS, 2008). For example, CPR is 37.2 percent for rural married women and 54.3 percent for their rural counterparts (DHS, 2008). Furthermore, rural adolescents (ages 15 to 19) experience much higher rates of pregnancy than their urban counterparts and have the lowest rate of contraceptive use (18 percent) among all Malagasy WRA (National Statistics Institute, 2013).</p><p>Despite government commitments to reducing maternal mortality, adolescent RH programs currently focus more on urban populations than rural youth. This lack of focus on rural areas indicates a missed opportunity given the reproductive health (RH) and FP-related disparities highlighted above. Bridging this disparity through tailoring FP interventions for rural Malagasy adolescents is required in order to continue increasing the CPR and reducing the TFR. Qualitative research on rural adolescent RH in Madagascar can provide vital insight to inform such interventions.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This qualitative study of adolescents (ages 10 to 19) and health providers sought to explore the social, cultural, and economic factors that influence adolescent RH in rural Madagascar, including factors that facilitate or hinder early pregnancy as well as seeking and accessing RH/FP services Moreover, the study investigated how attitudes, norms, and practices influence rural adolescent RH and identified implications for future research and programs focused on these issues.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data collection (December 2016) occurred in four regions in Madagascar (Sofia, Atsinanana, Analamanga and Menabe), diverse in terms of ethnicity, access to health services, literacy rate, and RH indicators. Methods incorporated in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). The study included two groups of female adolescents: very young (ages 10 to 14) via IDIs and slightly older (ages 15 to 19) via FGDs. To gain additional perspective about other factors that may influence young women’s RH-related behaviors, the study involved adolescent males (ages 15 to 19) via FGDs and health care providers (facility- and non-facility based) via IDIs.</p><p>In order to engage adolescents, the study employed participatory activities, including projective techniques using photographs and individual drawings. These techniques asked individuals to share opinions and attitudes while not asking directly about personal behavior.</p><p>A total of 226 individuals (200 adolescents and 26 providers) participated in the study, including 169 adolescents ages 15 to 19 (female=132; male=37), and 31 adolescent females ages 10-14. Data analysis included deductive coding with predetermined general codes (e.g. FP gender norms) followed by inductive coding applying Grounded Theory.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Findings shed light on normative influences on rural adolescent RH in Madagascar. Adolescents and providers, alike and across all four regions, explained that beliefs and behaviors of adolescent females were heavily influenced by a variety of factors outside their individual control. Specifically, they highlighted the role of fear and shame in sexual initiation, FP use, and unintended pregnancy. Moreover, they described ways in which parents and friends encouraged and discouraged participation in transactional sex, FP use, and decision-making related to unintended pregnancy.</p>\t\t\t<p>Respondents also expressed that for any individual female an ideal FP method existed and that norms around sexuality—centered on a woman’s age/parity—influenced these determinations. Participants expressed the idea that an appropriate FP method existed for everyone, determined by the body’s physical tolerance of a particular method and what fits the lifestyle of that young person. These two different yet reinforcing constructs supported norms around the inappropriateness of young women (especially those without children) to use long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs).</p>\t\t\t<p>Respondents further described the process of obtaining FP as governed by written and unwritten rules, which balanced medical eligibility and normative beliefs that LARCs were a poor fit, and even harmful, for nulliparous adolescents. Moreover, findings indicated that injectables and fertility beads were more popular among adolescents. Expected etiquette and standardized protocol during a visit with a provider included consideration of individual choice, yet ultimately led to prescriptive decisions justified by an existing screening criteria form that served to reinforce existing provider biases and misconceptions.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Overall, study findings fill a gap in the available literature about adolescents in Madagascar, especially those in rural areas, including both adolescent and health care provider perspectives. In addition, by including younger adolescents, this study highlights a group of adolescents often overlooked by research.</p><p>Study findings stress the importance of addressing normative influences within and outside an individual’s control in order to achieve greatest impact on rural adolescent RH in Madagascar. These influences meet in a conceptual model grounded in an ecological perspective, which highlights opportunities for programs at the individual, household, community, and structural levels. For example, strong misconceptions and concerns about LARCs among all groups of respondents suggest that LARC-related interventions need to go beyond activities that solely focus on adolescents as the primary audience. At the individual, household, and community levels, health communication activities or campaigns should incorporate messages that address misconceptions about FP methods, especially LARCs. Similarly, program activities aimed at providing services for adolescents should strategically incorporate the local health center, pharmacy, as well as midwives/birth attendants.</p><p>Furthermore, at the structural level, health care providers should receive training about client-centered counseling in order to increase providers’ self-awareness of their biases as well as about correct application of the standardized screening criteria.</p>",

      "title": "Reproductive autonomy and family planning service use among young women in Ghana",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Adolescence and young adulthood is a period where women are particularly at risk of unintended pregnancy. This is, in part, due to the substantial barriers that young women face in navigating reproductive health decision-making and accessing contraceptive methods from health facilities.  In their sexual partnerships, young women may face discordant fertility intentions with their partners and challenges navigating partner-dependent contraceptive methods. At the health facility, providers are sometimes a barrier to care and provider discrimination against adolescent girls has been well documented. In some cases, providers refuse to provide girls with services and in other cases, they scold or tease them such that the health facility becomes a hostile environment that young women prefer to avoid.</p><p>Reproductive autonomy (RA) is a measure of women’s empowerment specific to reproductive health decisions and outcomes. Upadhyay defines RA as “having the power to decide about and control matters related to contraceptive use, pregnancy, and childbearing.” The RA scale focuses on decision-making and control within a sexual/romantic partnership but has potential implications for a young woman’s ability to navigate the health system and access family planning (FP) services.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>While research in the US and in Ghana demonstrates that RA is associated with modern contraceptive use at last sex, to our knowledge, no prior research has investigated whether RA is associated with FP service use.  We hypothesize that higher levels of RA will be associated with increased odds of young women reporting prior use of FP services.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Survey data was collected from 1,080 women ages 15-24 recruited from health facilities, high schools, and universities in Accra and Kumasi, Ghana. To ensure a diversity of sexual and reproductive health experiences, we randomly selected settings and then surveyed a convenience sample. Following approval from the University of Michigan, University of Ghana, and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, the research team administered the survey on tablets using Qualtrix Mobile.</p><p>Our analytic sample comprised women who were sexually-experienced and in a relationship (n=574). Our RA construct had two sub-scales: communication and decision-making. Each had three items with Likert response options reflecting the degree to which respondents had power (decision-making sub-scale) or communicated with partners about fertility decisions (communication sub-scale). RA scores for each sub-scale range from 3-12. Higher scores indicated higher autonomy. The FP service use variable reflected whether young women reported having ever accessed birth control information or methods from clinics, community outreach workers, or pharmacies.  After understanding the distribution of our variables through descriptive statistics, we tested unadjusted associations between RA and use of FP services using student’s t-tests.  Following backwards stepwise model building and multiple sensitivity analyses, we selected a final multivariable logistic regression model.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In this population, the mean RA decision-making score was 7.74 (SD=2.02) and the mean communication score was 9.54 (SD=1.74).  Forty-three percent of the women reported ever having used FP services.</p><p></p><p>Since results were consistent between models that included the sub-scale separately and together, we present a final model that included both sub-scales in one model.</p><p>In our final multivariable model, the RA decision-making scale was significantly associated with having ever used FP services (OR=1.07, p=0.041, CI: 1.00-1.15) while the RA communication scale was not significantly associated (OR=1.11, p=0.13).  Respondent religion was also associated with FP service use with those reporting practicing an ‘Other Christian’ and ‘Muslim’ faith less likely to have accessed FP services than those who reported being of Pentecostal/Charismatic faith (OR=0.61, p=0.027; OR=0.32, p=0.02 respectively). Respondents with university education had, on average, 2.37 times the odds than those with no education to have used FP services (p=0.05).  Finally, those who reported being in a serious relationship but not cohabiting with their partner had 0.58 times the odds of having used FP services as those who were married or engaged (p=0.002).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results from this study indicate that decision-making autonomy is a key determinant of FP service use among young Ghanaian women. The RA communication scale, which reflects the extent to which the young woman can discuss matters related to sexual and reproductive health, was not associated with previous FP service use. This suggests that a young woman’s intrinsic motivation to use FP rather (not her ability to persuade and discuss this decision with her partner or health provider), may be an important factor in determining her ability to access these services.  Public health interventions need to support and educate young Ghanaian women about various contraceptive options so that they can make independent decisions about the best fertility and contraceptive outcomes for them. </p><p>Additional research utilizing qualitative approaches is needed about the factors associated with RA and the ways in which RA manifest both in partnership dynamics.  Future research should explore RA as a construct that can include influences outside of a sexual partnership.</p><p>Relationships between covariates of interest and FP service use suggest the need for tailored interventions for young women who may be at risk of unwanted pregnancy.  Thus, FP interventions should be tailored by level of educational attainment, religion, and relationship status, in order to address the needs and circumstances of specific groups of young women.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally, almost half of all pregnancies are unintended, placing mothers and newborns at greater risk for adverse health outcomes and preventable maternal and neonatal mortality1. A critical gap exists for family planning (FP) services that are tailored to women’s specific needs, desires, and circumstances. As global efforts to improve quality FP counseling and care increase, research suggests that interventions can be more effective with the integration of a person-centered approach2. Additionally, evidence demonstrates that a person-centered approach may lead to improvements in continuation of FP methods and increased patient satisfaction and knowledge2,3. Despite this increased global focus on improving the quality of person-centered reproductive health care, validated measurement tools have not been used to identify areas for improvement of person-centered care (PCC) quality for FP. To fill this void, we applied a person-centered family planning (PCFP) scale to facilities in Kenya. Findings from application of the scale informed the selection of specific PCC topics to be addressed in a Quality Improvement (QI) intervention. This intervention aims to secure improvements in PCC behaviors among FP practitioners to improve FP care experiences overall and increase adoption and continuation of FP methods.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Four public health facilities were selected to participate in the QI intervention. We used the Model for Improvement (MFI) to frame our intervention design. Under the MFI, we have applied Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) testing cycles to secure improvements in PCC behaviors. Within an improvement collaborative structure, the QI teams work on common PCC topics and meet together every three months to share their learning. The overarching goal of the QI intervention is to understand whether QI teams can improve aspects of PCC in FP services by applying the MFI. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Surveys of 522 women receiving a FP method were conducted across 7 public facilities in Kenya. Of these, four were selected to participate in the QI intervention. PCC scores were analyzed across the four intervention facilities to identify topics requiring improvement. Topics where all four facilities scored </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In the first three month period, improvement teams focused on whether healthcare providers introduce themselves to FP clients and whether healthcare providers call clients by their name. Over this period, the percentage of FP clients who reported that healthcare providers introduced themselves increased from an aggregate median baseline of 31% to 75%. At the facility level, the greatest improvement observed for this topic was from a median baseline of 0% to 100%, and the smallest from 31% to 67%. In addition, the percentage of FP clients who reported that healthcare providers called them by their name increased from an aggregate median baseline of 38% to 75%. At the facility level, the greatest improvement observed was from a median baseline of 0% to 100% and the smallest from 10% to 50%. In the second period, improvement teams will focus on practitioners asking FP clients undergoing more invasive procedures such as injections or IUD insertions about how they are feeling, and whether these clients feel they can ask practitioners any questions. Results will be reported for aggregate and individual facility improvements made on the initial topics, as well as topics for subsequent improvement periods, all of which target an improvement in PCC.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Patient experience is a key determinant in adoption and continuation of FP methods. Assuring  that FP care is respectful, timely, and supportive of a woman’s desires and needs is both a human right and a programmatic imperative. Assuring or improving PCC has been difficult, as established measures of this aspect of quality are limited. Our experience applying a scale for a multi-dimensional measure of PCC has proven successful in identifying relevant topics for improvement in four public facilities in Kenya. Selection of PCC topics that are relevant to clients allows providers to align with real challenges that clients are experiencing.</p><p>The use of a context-specific scale has allowed facility quality-improvement teams to understand specific key concerns of patient care experiences, such as developing rapport through provider introductions and assuring clients’ comfort asking questions. Preliminary results suggest that this approach has empowered and encouraged staff to improve PCC behaviors given the preferences and needs of their family planning clients. We anticipate that adopting the MFI framework in addition to using a validated PCFP scale will allow facilities to be able to measure and track their progress consistently, while also engaging with facilities in a participatory approach to establish lasting change and improve provider motivation. Taken together, we believe this approach may result in sustainable improvements in quality family planning care.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p>1. Sedge, Singh &amp; Hussain, 2014</p><p>2.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Women in extreme poverty are one of the most under-served groups in sexual and reproductive healthcare.  This disparity elevates the need for programmes to track their reach to those living in extreme poverty in order to manage and improve performance, but this tracking presents difficulties.  Unlike age, marital status, or many other indicators assessing our reach to under-served populations, wealth (and thus poverty) cannot readily be assessed with a single question.  Instead, various sets of questions assessing factors associated with wealth are typically used to elucidate client socio-economic status.  These indices provide an easy way for organizations to measure how equitable their programmes are through the proportion of clients in poverty, but are of a length that commonly limits their use to survey-based data collection.  Being able to measure client wealth through routine data collection, such as client records or management information systems, would allow implementers to measure equity with more granularity, both in time and location, while substantially reducing costs in comparison to using surveys.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Can we develop an approach using 1-2 questions per client, that is easy to implement in service delivery settings and incorporate into management information systems, that allows us to assess client wealth, manage performance in reaching couples in extreme poverty, and develop better insights into how to improve service delivery to this critically under-served population?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Two routine poverty data collection approaches were developed and tested.  The first involved using a single static question from the Demographic and Health Survey’s wealth index, selected due to its strength in discriminating households as being in the bottom 2 wealth quintiles or the top 3.  The second approach uses different 1-2 question subsets of an entire wealth index, asked either randomly or sequentially.  Each approach was tested for accuracy in assessing client wealth and for acceptability and ease of implementation.  Pilots of the two approaches in service delivery settings, followed by process evaluations with service delivery staff, were used to assess implementation practicality.  Pilots were conducted in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda from late 2015 through early 2018, collecting routine poverty data on over 276,000 sexual and reproductive health clients.  The accuracy of routine poverty data was tested through three methods: mathematical simulations using existing population and client data, comparisons of pilot data results against full poverty assessments collected using client exit interviews, and assessing the strength of the association between routine poverty data collected in the pilots and existing third-party geospatial data on the population wealth of the catchment areas of each pilot service delivery site.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Both routine poverty data collection approaches were considered easy to implement by service delivery staff.  We found it important to preface the question, as many are not medically relevant; with this preamble, acceptability based on response rates was high (80-97%).  Simulations had suggested high concordance with the single static question approach and national population data, but in an actual client population, the approach had poor positive predictive value (47%) and sensitivity (64%).  Accuracy using random or sequential subsets of an index was found to be much higher.  The resulting measure is not of individual clients, but of the average client, so accuracy was assessed by margin of error from true population averages.  Convergence on true average client wealth was quickly achieved; using 2 Progress out of Poverty Index questions, the margin of error with 95% confidence was under ±10% with 20 respondents, and under ±5% after 75 respondents.  Respondents needed to be doubled for the same accuracy with 1 dynamic question.  No bias was introduced in relative poverty measures.  Mapping poverty scores to absolute PPI or Multidimensional-Poverty Index values, however, potentially results in bias.  Initial work suggests the rotating subset of questions could provide unbiased measures of the proportion of clients under various relative wealth cut-offs (e.g. the bottom 2 wealth quintiles); further analysis will confirm this possibility in the coming months.  Correlation with external data for a single static question was moderate (0.40), but substantially higher using a rotating subset of questions (preliminarily -0.72, with additional data pending).</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>We have developed a new method to assess poverty on a routine basis.  Using a random or rotating subset of 1-2 questions from various wealth indices provides a valid and reliable measure of relative wealth with small client numbers without burdening service delivery staff or clients.  Utilising such an approach readily affords an array of possibilities to programmes to strengthen service delivery to the under-served and better identify what works and what does not in interventions targeted towards those in extreme poverty.  Organizations can assess the relative wealth of clients in each service delivery site every day, identifying which sites perform better in equity and allowing progress to be tracked across time, location, and – with client-level data – sub-group of interest.  We can rapidly evaluate the impact on reaching poorer clients of changes in service delivery, demand generation, voucher targeting, or other activities – allowing us to better identify what works in serving this heavily under-served population.  Women and men in extreme poverty are one of the most under-served populations in sexual and reproductive health care, and Marie Stopes International will be expanding its use of routine poverty data in the coming months to step-change the effectiveness of its programming in addressing this critical need.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning decisions are complex, and often involve several people in the household and beyond. Both contextual factors - such as distance to a clinic or commodity supply - and internal beliefs, emotions, and biases may influence if, when, and which method a couple uses and why (Bongaarts et al. 2012). To capture these drivers, a set of methods is needed. In many programs, research and interventions focus mainly on increasing awareness and access, as there is expertise on how to measure and change them. Yet, these are only a sub-set of the barriers to family planning uptake. Therefore, the sector is in need of a comprehensive methodological framework encompassing the measurement and analysis of beliefs, norms, and intentions around family planning, as well as behaviors and decision dynamics. As standard direct survey methodology is only able to relay what the respondent is able and willing to verbalize, we expanded the methods we used to get a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous pathways from becoming aware to forming an intention and finally acting, and the ‘why’ behind the ‘what’. In addition, we used a novel, evidence-based behavioral model to systematically categorize emerging drivers, so interventions can be targeted.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Is it feasible to expand standard survey methodology to encompass other interdisciplinary qualitative and quantitative, experimental and analytical, techniques, and do those techniques offer added value over direct self-report in determining drivers of behavior around family planning decisions? Can the suite of methods used here be combined into a framework offering a comprehensive way to studying decision-making in a resource-constrained setting?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted research on households (n=35 (immersions), 144 (journey), 240 (decision-making game), frontline workers (n=19(I)/96(J)/244(D)), and facility staff (n=35(I)/46(D)) in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, where use of modern methods has remained extremely low. Phase 1 of our research (2016-17) investigated decision drivers in depth, building on existing research with interdisciplinary qualitative methods adapted from market research and experimental psychology. We used immersion interviews, consumer journey mapping, which tracks people’s experiences and interactions with a product or service over time, and customized decision-making games incorporating behavioral science concepts. The combination of the methods enabled us to go beyond explicit verbalization and the associated social desirability bias, and instead infer latent drivers of behavior. We then used a model of a comprehensive set of behavioral drivers, synthesized from evidence across many sectors, to categorize responses and determine the drivers found. In Phase 2 (in progress), we are extending this research to large-scale quantitative surveys to quantify drivers of behavior, and use psycho-behavioral segmentation (Sgaier et al. 2017) to segment household members and providers. In addition, we use market research-based forecasting to gauge demand for new methods, and assess the feasibility of implicit methods to measure biases around methods and service providers.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, the qualitative research streams in Phase 1 were able to uncover a wide variety of both contextual and internal drivers that differed among household members and providers (see abstract by Sgaier et al.). We showed that rural, partly illiterate, respondents were able to engage in diverse methods such as decision-making games and consumer journey mapping. We also, for the first time, utilized a novel behavioral framework to systematically analyze responses in terms of the behavioral drivers they represent. Decision-making games and immersion uncovered barriers to intention formation including strong social norms, inadequate risk perceptions, and emotional barriers around procuring or discussing commodities. The combination of the methods also helped us map decision dynamics for each method separately, and track which barriers and drivers were most important at which stage of decision-making. For Phase 2, results are still outstanding; however, we predict that we will uncover segments differing along their drivers towards and away from family planning uptake or service provision, and that they will only weakly overlap with segments based purely on demographic factors. We will also be able to estimate market shares for new methods using demand-based forecasting. Finally, we will have demonstrated a proof-of-concept of using implicit attitude experiments in this non-traditional context. Implicit experiments, which uncover attitudes via rapid choices participants make in response to a series of stimuli, rather than stated self-report, have a long history in developed country laboratory research, but are novel in populations such as the ones studied here.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>In Phase 1, we showed that a spectrum of complementary qualitative methods could uncover a full picture of the reasons <em>why</em> various members of a household or health sector workers were (not) using or providing family planning methods. All methods used – immersions, consumer journey mapping, and decision-making games - were feasible for a population very different from the usual audiences for market research and experimental psychology techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a systematic framework outlining fundamental drivers of behavior was generalizable enough that it could be applied to the analysis of a topic area for which it was not explicitly conceived. At the end of this study, quantitative studies will have established the prevalence of the qualitative findings, and the feasibility and added value of implicit over explicit methods will emerge. In addition, psycho-behavioral segmentation will enable even more finely-targeted interventions based on differential drivers of behavior. Overall, we have developed a comprehensive methods framework that we applied in an especially challenging geography and which can now be used to study family planning, and other areas of decision-making, in other contexts. This comprehensive and integrated methodology incorporates observational and experimental, qualitative and quantitative research methods, and allows programs to identify the full set of contextual and internal drivers of and barriers to modern contraceptive use, develop actionable segments to design and deliver targeted interventions, and forecast the market share of each method.</p>",

      "title": "New guidance and indicators for M&amp;E of community based access to injectables",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In response to global efforts to increase task shifting in family planning, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance addressing which cadres of health care workers may provide which family planning services. For injectable contraception, the WHO guidance recommends community health worker (CHW) provision with “targeted monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E).” While WHO did not define \"targeted\" or expand upon specific circumstances under which CHWs could provide injectable contraception, consensus in the global family planning community is that the emphasis on “targeted” M&amp;E should be related to the safety of such programs.  For example, some have questioned whether CHWs can provide injectables in a community setting with proper screening and aseptic techniques.  Without guidance from WHO, programs were left on their own to determine how to design M&amp;E to ensure the safety of their community-based injectable services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To assist countries in following the WHO recommendation, we initiated a project funded by the Pfizer Foundation to develop written guidance on M&amp;E of community-based access to injectable contraception (CBA2I), including recommended M&amp;E indicators. We developed an evidence-based approach by triangulating data from a literature review, a technical consultation of experts in the field, and real-world experiences in several countries already implementing CBA2I programs.  Both the guidance and the indicators can be adapted for clients who self-inject and receive commodities through community distribution.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We used three complementary methodologies.</p><p><strong><em>Literature review</em></strong></p><p>We reviewed published literature, gray papers, and unpublished program and project summaries and program documents to better understand the status of M&amp;E in countries implementing CBA2I, to identify M&amp;E indicators, and to select countries for case studies.</p><p><strong><em>Technical consultation</em></strong></p><p>In June 2016, we convened 10 international technical experts in the fields of M&amp;E and family planning to gain input and buy-in for a set of standardized CBA2I indicators. The group met for two days and used a facilitated consensus-building process to develop a list of essential and expanded indicators.  Meeting participants represented various countries, levels of program implementation, and expertise in injectable contraception and M&amp;E. </p><p><strong><em>Case studies </em></strong></p><p>We conducted case studies in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda). The countries were selected to represent various regions, and a range of programs (national versus international nongovernmental organization (INGO) supported), long-standing and newer programs. </p><p>We conducted interviews with those involved with CBA2I and collected relevant tools and job aids. Interviewees included those in technical and M&amp;E roles such as program managers and administrators, district staff, facility-based staff, community health workers (CHWs) who provide CBA2I, and personnel at INGOs.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Our triangulated evidence-based approach identified program design and M&amp;E practices that will help strengthen the safety and accountability of CBA2I programs. We recommend CBA2I programs implement the following practices:</p><ul>\t<li>Conduct regular supervisions </li>\t<li>Deliver quality training on data collection and use</li>\t<li>Ensure timely submission of accurate data reports</li>\t<li>Analyze and use data at multiple levels</li>\t<li>Conduct data quality assessments</li>\t<li>Offer regular refresher training</li>\t<li>Recognize and support CHWs</li></ul><p>We collaborated with technical consultants to develop 18 recommended indicators in five categories: Training, Supervision, Readiness, Service Delivery and Data Quality.  From the expanded list of 18 indicators, we have designated four as “essential”.  Where resources do not allow for the full set of indicators to be implemented, these can provide an important snapshot into the status of CBA2I programs.</p><ul>\t<li><strong>Number and percent of CHWs certified to inject contraception</strong>—Ensures CHWs are trained to safely provide injections, and assesses whether there are enough CHWs to meet demand.  </li>\t<li><strong>Number and percent of CHWs certified during the previous reporting period who received at least one in-person supportive supervision visit for providing injectable contraception within one month after successful completion of practicum</strong>—Assesses safety and quality of the services provided.  Programs may have different ideas of when the first supervision should take place, but generally within one month.</li>\t<li><strong>Number and percent of CHWs reporting a stock-out of injectables</strong>—Assesses whether commodities are meeting demand.</li>\t<li><strong>Number of injections provided</strong>—Assess whether the project has created enough demand and is meeting its goals.</li></ul>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>In collaboration with our technical consultants, we put forth the new guidance and tools to assist countries to better follow WHO’s recommendation for CBA2I with targeted M&amp;E.  In addition to the 12-page guidance, the package includes adaptable sample M&amp;E tools and country case study summaries. We present recommendations for uptake of the guidance and tools into programs as well as available feedback from early adopters.</p><p>Program implications of the guidance include allowing managers to ensure a program is achieving goals and outcomes, and to identify problems or constraints as well as any unintended consequences. For CBA2I, carefully considered indicators can help managers ensure that adequate numbers of properly trained CHWs have what they need to consistently provide safe, high-quality services, use their skills regularly, and are trained to collect accurate, valid, and timely data. M&amp;E data are vital for guiding the planning, coordination, and implementation of the program at large and specific CBA2I programs; assessing the effectiveness of the program and identifying areas for improvement; and ensuring accountability to clients as well as to those providing resources. With proper time and effort invested at the start, implementing new indicators can be a smooth process, resulting in improved M&amp;E systems, higher quality services, and a healthier group of users.</p>",

      "title": "The retrospective reproductive calendar: a closer look at reliability",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The reproductive calendar is an individual-level survey instrument that collects month-by-month retrospective histories of contraceptive use and details reasons for discontinuation. A handful of prior studies [1-6] suggests calendar data may provide a reasonably reliable picture of previous contraceptive use among older women or women with less complex histories. However, adolescent women and those with shorter episodes of contraceptive use may be less able to provide accurate recall of prior contraceptive behavior. Previous assessments of the reproductive calendar, however, have important limitations and, as Callahan and Becker observed, the reliability of the calendar method used in many large-scale surveys “remains largely unknown.” The largest hindrance to conducting rigorous research on the reliability of calendar data centers on a dearth of appropriate longitudinal datasets with overlapping panels of calendar surveys. Callahan and Becker suggest at least a two-year period of overlap to assess consistency in reports of method type, use duration, and switching; prior studies have had only three to five months of overlap [5]. I address these shortcomings by utilizing overlapping contraceptive calendars from a demographic longitudinal panel survey conducted in three urban areas of Kenya, allowing us to describe the frequency of <em>discordant </em>reports between the two panels.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objective of this study is to describe the frequency of discordant reports of contraceptive method use and duration utilizing overlapping contraceptive calendars from a demographic longitudinal panel survey conducted in three urban areas of Kenya. We aim to understand whether women are able to reliably self-report their prior contraceptive behavior and whether results are modified by age or method type.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data collection took place in three urban areas in Kenya among a representative sample of women of reproductive age. In addition to participating in the retrospective calendar, respondents were asked about current contraceptive use, demographic characteristics, fertility desires, and exposure to family planning messages, among other things. The first retrospective calendar covered a period of three years and was implemented in 2012. A second calendar, covering approximately five years, was implemented in 2014. These two calendar instruments were identical in content and overlapped by a period of 32 months. A total of 2,412 women participated in both rounds of data collection. The two calendar panels are being used to compare within-woman concordance of self-reported calendar data provided at the two different time points.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>More than one-third of the 2,412 women interviewed in 2014 did not accurately recall the method they reported using at the point of interview in 2012 and this discordance was even greater for shorter-acting methods like pills (41%) and condoms (72%). Furthermore, when comparing the entire 32-month period of overlap that occurred from January 2010 to August 2012, more than two-thirds of participants had one or more discrepancies at some point during the 32-month time period, suggesting low reliability of the reproductive calendar instrument in this population. Further data analysis is ongoing and will be used to assess meaningful patterns of difference within the period of calendar overlap, stratified by age and method type.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Large numbers of women – especially adolescent women – discontinue contraceptive use shortly after uptake. Current research calls for a better understanding of contraceptive behavior through a more detailed look at contraceptive discontinuation. A key component of responding to this call is a better understanding of the reliability of data produced by the reproductive calendar instrument – a data collection tool implemented widely among large-scale demographic surveys conducted in low-income countries. Prior studies are sparse and have lacked adequate data to appropriately assess calendar reliability. This analysis addresses this research gap, using novel data to explore the reliability of retrospective reproductive calendar. Preliminary findings suggest poor reliability of the reproductive calendar, particularly among women using short-term methods. The authors will also consider and discuss the benefits and disadvantages of alternative approaches to collecting data on women’s contraceptive behavior over time.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Demographic and Health Surveys Program (DHS) has been a key source of fertility, health, and nutrition data for over 30 years. To meet existing and emerging data needs, every five years, the DHS Program embarks on a revision of its core household, women’s and men’s questionnaires. The most recent revision concluded in 2014 and resulted in the DHS-VII core questionnaire, which has been utilized in all DHSs fielded since late-2015. Changes to the contraception portion of the women’s core questionnaire were minimal, and with the space afforded by two dropped questions, a new question was added to women who were married or in-union and not using contraception: “Would you say that not using contraception is mainly your decision, mainly your husband’s/partner’s decision, or did you both decide together?” This addition is the corollary to an existing question that, since the DHS-IV, has been asked among in-union women who are using contraception, “Would you say that using contraception is mainly your decision, mainly your husband’s/partner’s decision, or did you both decide together?”</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>1. Given that a conscious decision is not always made to “not do [something]”, are women providing answers to this new question? </p><p>2. Does contraceptive decision-making power differ between contraceptive users and non-users? Who is making the decision to use and not to use? Among contraceptive non-users, do decision-making differentials exist by unmet need status?</p><p>3. If decision-making differentials do exist, do they also reflect empowerment differentials as measured by other decision-making variables?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data come from the Demographic and Health Surveys from 8 countries whose surveys conducted between 2015 and 2016 included this question as of September 2018. These are Angola, Armenia, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Tanzania. Since questions on decision-making to/not to use contraception are limited to women in-union, we also restrict our sample to married or in-union women. Among all in-union women, we will assess differentials in decision-making by contraceptive use status (no unmet need, unmet need, using contraception) based on descriptive and multivariate analyses. Among contraceptive non-users, we will examine differentials in decision-making by unmet need status. In order to understand contraceptive use and non-use dynamics, we run separate logistic regression analyses for decision-making to use and not to use contraception (0=respondent/joint decision, 1= partner/other’s decision) and control for background characteristics. Additionally, we also conduct analyses to determine whether these differentials reflect other empowerment differentials measured by the household decision-making scale.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Across the sample, far higher proportions of contraceptive users than non-users are themselves making decisions about using contraception. Focusing on contraceptive non-users, over a third of women in all study countries have unmet need for either spacing or limiting. Our analyses show marked differentials in contraceptive decision-making by unmet need, which are significant (p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our concerns about the ability of the new question to yield meaningful information are assuaged. Women are answering the question and their answers correlate with other aspects of their lives. As expected given previously observed relationships between contraceptive use and women’s empowerment, women who are contraceptive users are significantly more likely to have made the decision to use themselves alone or jointly with their partner as compared to non-users. Moreover, women with unmet need are significantly less likely to have participated in contraceptive use decision- making. Our results shed additional insights. Marital or union duration is important in contraceptive decision-making across all countries, though the direction of that relationship varies by country. Other background characteristics are also highly correlated with contraceptive decision-making with employment being an important factor in Malawi and Tanzania, and wealth being is an important factor in Angola and Armenia. Finally, data from this new question are being considered for use in measuring Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 5.6.1, “Proportion of women aged 15-49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care.”  Our findings lend credence to use of these data for this purpose.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The importance of routine health management information systems (HMIS) has been well-documented. Data from these systems is used to measure and track progress on health objectives at national and sub-national levels. Sub-national and district-level health managers, facility-based in-charges, and other health workers rely on HMIS data for improving service delivery. Standardized collection of data elements across countries supports measurement of progress towards global targets and initiatives.</p><p>Certain countries and the global community have developed renewed interest in HMIS data as a cost-effective way to monitor family planning (FP) trends and as a potential data source for FP2020 projections on country progress towards FP2020 goals. Nonetheless, gaps remain; for instance, postpartum family planning (PPFP) has gained momentum as an evidence-based strategy to reduce unintended pregnancies, yet many countries have little routine service data to assess the success of their interventions. Some countries are adjusting HMIS tools to better track FP indicators related to critical populations such as postpartum women, postabortion women, and youth. There has not been a systematic review of the FP data elements that countries collect as part of national HMIS systems to know how many countries record specific FP data elements and if consistent indicator definitions are being applied.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This review, conducted by the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID’s) flagship Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP), aimed to: 1) identify PPFP data elements recorded in facility registers and reported in monthly summary forms, and 2) document other data elements related to FP services reported monthly by facilities into national HMIS in USAID priority FP countries. The review also aimed to assess how well country data elements align with globally-recommended indicators. In addition, for PPFP, the review sought to identify any potential quick wins where countries could revise HMIS systems to improve availability of PPFP data.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A spreadsheet of FP data elements was developed based on an initial evaluation of HMIS tools collected by Jhpiego/MCSP during 2016-2017 from 36 countries. This list was refined based on expert opinion of data elements key to global tracking and program performance monitoring. The final list included elements such as FP client type, adolescent age disaggregation, commodities distributed, and FP users by method. A data element extraction workbook was developed to capture key data elements.</p><p>A subset of 18 countries out of USAID’s 24 FP priority countries were selected for inclusion in the review, based on MCSP’s ability to obtain facility monthly summary reports and registers for antenatal care (ANC), labor and delivery (L&amp;D), postnatal care (PNC), and FP. Preliminary results are presented for 17 of 18 countries (one pending translation of tools).</p><p>Using the data element extraction workbook, two reviewers completed separate analysis of monthly summary forms from each country to record FP/PPFP data elements, then compared and compiled results into a single workbook to ensure consensus and accuracy. An Excel compiler collated data for analysis. The two reviewers also analyzed facility registers (ANC, L&amp;D, PNC, FP) to identify PPFP data elements, noting the details in a summary table.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Countries reviewed were: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DRC, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia.</p><p>Preliminary results show PPFP and post-abortion FP (PAFP) are rarely reported. Of 17 countries reviewed, three capture PPFP in monthly summary forms (DRC, India, Malawi). DRC is the only country where PAFP is captured in the monthly summary form. While eight countries’ facility registers include PPFP, there is little consistency in which registers are used: L&amp;D, PNC, and FP registers are all used. Three countries (Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda) capture PPFP in at least one register, but do not report it in the summary form. Another three countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria, Rwanda) are modifying registers and reports to include PPFP disaggregated by method. Only six countries report adolescents/youth aged 10-19 receiving FP services.</p><p>FP client types reported commonly reflect differentiation between “new” versus “old” users. Fifteen countries include a “new user” data element and twelve have some measure of revisits/continuing users. Examination of new user definitions, where available, found a high degree of inconsistency: some countries defined it as ‘beginning FP for the first time ever,’ irrespective of method; others defined it as ‘individuals new to an FP method.’ Definitions were often too ambiguous to reach a conclusion about how new users were measured.</p><p>Finally, due to lack of differentiation on type of injectables or implants provided, only five countries have routine data necessary to calculate couple-years of protection (CYP) (note: there are not yet CYP conversion factors for hormonal IUDs).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This review presents analysis of existing opportunities and gaps regarding key FP indicators in current HMIS reports at the facility level. It provides a realistic snapshot of what FP trends and data elements can be identified from current HMIS reports. As shown, PPFP data is infrequently reported in facility monthly summary forms, but the incorporation of new indicators currently in process across multiple countries suggests addressing PPFP measurement is a growing priority. There is also ample room for improvement of reporting on PAFP, adolescents, and youth.</p><p>This review highlights the inherent difficulties in comparing data elements across multiple countries. In particular, the term “new users” needs to be harmonized to better distinguish between the multiple definitions currently in use. Similarly, there is a need for better indicators on continuation/discontinuation, which is also inconsistently captured. As a greater variety of methods become available with differing durations of efficacy, attention is warranted to listing the specific methods provided to clients (type of injectables, implants, IUDs) to enable accurate calculation of CYP.</p><p>HMIS systems must balance the desire to capture detailed data for decision-making with the associated recording burden of such data collection and compilation. Further discussion should be held on what categories of FP users are most important for decision-making at different levels of the system, and to what degree data elements should be disaggregated in summary reporting. Stakeholders can use results of this review to advocate for FP-related adjustments to country-level HMIS tools to align country systems with global recommendations.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The global movement to reach universal health coverage (UHC) presents opportunities to advance family planning (FP) goals. The FP community has a keen interest in whether and how the full range of contraceptive services can be made accessible, particularly to underserved populations such as youth or the poor, within broader initiatives that aim to achieve UHC.</p><p>Governments and their partners use a variety of programs to finance FP. Many are transitioning from vertical programs dedicated to FP and funded by donors, to broader financing initiatives (e.g., national health insurance schemes) that are financed with domestic resources and integrate FP into a more comprehensive set of benefits.</p><p> Financial terms for clients and providers matter. The amount of money paid for services, and who pays that money – the client, or a third party such as an insurance or voucher scheme – can affect coverage, choice of method, and choice of provider.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>USAID’s Sustaining Health Outcomes in the Private Sector (SHOPS) Plus project has distilled common approaches to finance health within the context of UHC and assessed the significance of these financing approaches for FP. The presentation focuses on the role of private FP providers and the mechanisms used to pay them. It explores the characteristics and implications of strategic purchasing mechanisms such as capitation on financing of and access to FP. It targets a FP audience that may be less familiar with health financing concepts.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The presentation is based on a brief published by USAID’s SHOPS Plus project in January 2018 entitled “Integrating Family Planning into Universal Health Coverage Efforts” (I am lead author).</p><p>Link: https://www.shopsplusproject.org/resource-center/integrating-family-planning-universal-health-coverage-efforts</p><p>Location: Findings feature USAID’s 22 priority FP countries, with specific examples highlighted from countries such as Ghana, the Philippines, Kenya and Tanzania that are pursuing UHC through government-sponsored health insurance schemes.</p><p>Setting: Data collected include findings from an October 2016 consultative meeting on FP and UHC, hosted by SHOPS Plus, USAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. These findings were augmented by desk-based research and key informant interviews conducted in person or by telephone.</p><p>Time frame: October 2016 – January 2018</p><p>Intended beneficiaries: The presentation targets FP practitioners who want to better understand principles of health financing mechanisms that support UHC, and how these financing mechanisms enable or inhibit sustainable access to a full range of FP methods. Additionally, it targets health financing program sponsors; and donors and implementing partners interested in UHC, FP, public-private partnerships and private sector health.</p><p>Participant size: not applicable</p><p>Evaluation approach:  described in program intervention section above</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Advancing toward UHC and providing universal access to FP requires surmounting:</p>\t<li>\t<p><strong>Insufficient financial resources:</strong>  Health spending by 20 of USAID’s 22 priority FP countries falls short of the recommended Abuja target of 15% of total spending.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p><strong>Political/social realities</strong>: Governments may prioritize less cost-effective but urgent, and often life-saving, curative services such as cancer treatment instead of preventive/primary services (including FP). FP coverage can be further limited by religious, gender, and cultural preferences and norms.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p><strong>Focus on formal sector</strong>: Health financing programs, particularly insurance schemes, often limit coverage to civil servants or other formally employed households.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p><strong>Focus on curative services</strong>: FP and commodities may be excluded.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p><strong>Limited access to private providers</strong>: Services may be covered only at public providers, whose capacity and quality may fall short. Citizens―even the poor―choose to obtain FP from private providers and pay for them out of pocket.</p>\t</li><p>Fourteen of USAID’s 22 FP priority countries operate government-sponsored health insurance schemes. However, only six cover FP: Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Philippines, and Rwanda.</p><p>Actual practice may differ from stated policy, however. Payment mechanisms and rates influence providers’ willingness to participate in health financing programs, and when they do, whether they have an incentive to provide one method over another. The effect of payment approaches and rates will vary by provider, depending on the provider’s cost structure and business objectives. These factors, and out-of-pocket costs borne by clients can influence the extent to which people can genuinely choose the FP method of their choice.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Just because it’s covered, doesn’t mean it’s covered! Researchers suggest that <em>effective</em> coverage is a holistic metric that considers population need, use, and quality of services, is a feasible and more accurate way to measure progress toward UHC (Ng et al., 2014). Effective coverage of FP in health financing programs depends on the program’s design― for example its provider payment mechanisms, and which providers it contracts to deliver services, along with external factors such as treatment-seeking behavior and preferences of citizens themselves.</p><p>FP advocates have much to learn about the nexus between provider payment approaches, client cost sharing, provider network composition, and other components of health financing programs. The global health community needs more evidence and documented lessons across a greater number of settings to understand how these factors enable or inhibit access to quality FP and other health services.</p><p>Other regions, in particular Africa, may emulate the achievements of Latin America and the Caribbean over time as they make progress toward UHC. Lessons from this more mature region suggest that programs supporting UHC and universal access to FP will increase coverage of FP over time. However, they will continue to have gaps, particularly in reaching vulnerable populations.</p><p>Making progress toward UHC and satisfying unmet need for FP is a long-term process, but one that can be accelerated. Advocates can champion better coverage of FP by building the evidence base, promoting inclusion of private providers, and gaining a better understanding of the concepts and language of health financing.</p>",

      "title": "Is Health Insurance Associated with Improved Family Planning Access? A Review of Household Survey Data from Seven FP2020 Countries",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Many lower-middle-income countries are focusing on increasing health insurance coverage as a conduit to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Whether by national, social, or community-based health insurance schemes, many countries are making significant improvements in expanding access to affordable healthcare. As a result, there is a need to consider how such UHC-oriented schemes ensure appropriate access to and financing of family planning services (FP). Affordable, rights-based FP is a global development priority that forms one part of a broad continuum of essential reproductive, maternal, and child health services. Previous analysis by the USAID-funded Health Policy Plus (HP+) project assessed the degree of FP integration into UHC-oriented insurance schemes in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a focus on the parallel progress of insurance coverage and FP service utilization. In this study, we considered the direct association between coverage under UHC-oriented schemes and levels and characteristics of modern contraceptive use in a set of middle-income countries in Asia and Africa, focusing on issues such as proportional insurance coverage, modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), and the modern method mix. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We conducted an analysis to systematically examine the association between health insurance coverage and key family planning access indicators in seven developing countries. The analysis is structured around the following questions:</p><p>1. What are the characteristics of the health insurance schemes in the sampled countries, and to what extent has family planning been incorporated into each scheme?</p><p>2. Is membership in the health insurance scheme associated with higher mCPR or differences in method mix and source, compared to non-membership?</p><p>3. Does insurance promote health equity in the family planning context (i.e., is insurance status associated with improved family planning access among the poor)?  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>HP+ analyzed seven low- and lower-middle-income countries from the World Bank’s Universal Health Coverage Studies Series that have made significant progress toward instituting and scaling-up UHC-oriented schemes. These countries also committed to expanding access to family planning information, services, and supplies under the global FP2020 initiative. We analyzed the following countries’ demographic health survey (DHS) data: Ethiopia (2016), Ghana (2014), Kenya (2014), Kyrgyzstan (2012), Nigeria (2013), Philippines (2013), and Indonesia’s 2015 Susenas household survey.</p><p>Data on insurance coverage over time and the extent to which family planning has been integrated into health insurance was collected through a desk review of literature on the countries’ health systems and health financing structures. HP+ conducted statistical analysis of key family planning access indicators stratified by insurance coverage status and asset-based wealth quintiles using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and 2015 Indonesia’s national household survey (Susenas) data. We used self-reported insurance coverage and the following FP indicators: modern contraceptive prevalence, method mix among modern contraception users, and the most recent source of modern contraceptive method among users, to assess the association of FP utilization with insurance coverage.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>All of the countries we analyzed include some degree of FP services in their UHC-oriented insurance schemes. We expected that mCPR for women enrolled in these schemes would be higher due to lower financial barriers to access. Overall we found that, among women married or in union, mCPR was higher among the insured in five of the seven countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, and the Philippines. In these countries, mCPR was greater among insured vs. uninsured women by between 16% and 27%. In Ghana and Indonesia, mCPR was lower among insured women but the difference was not statistically significant.    </p><p>Use of permanent methods was higher among insured vs. uninsured women in Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, and the Philippines. The difference in permanent method use between insured and uninsured was highest in the Philippines (at 25.25% vs. 17.7%, respectively). Use of long-acting reversible methods was also higher among insured married women, compared to uninsured women in all countries except Ghana and the Philippines, and highest in Kyrgyzstan (insured: 66%, uninsured: 61.6%). In contrast, short-acting method use was higher among uninsured women than insured women in all countries except Ghana, where it was66.1% among insured and 62% among uninsured women.</p><p>Overall, we found that insurance enrollment is more strongly associated with higher mCPR among the poor, and the ratio of mCPR between insured and uninsured was higher in the poorest quintile than the richest in four of six countries for which data were available: Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, and the Philippines. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our analysis found consistent evidence of a relationship between insurance enrollment and improved FP indicators (i.e. higher mCPR and prevalence of long-acting methods) in Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Philippines. Furthermore, most contraceptive users chose methods specifically included in their countries’ benefit packages. In some countries, the absence of such a relationship may be explained by challenges in insurance implementation, including unauthorized user fees.</p><p>This analysis is not proof of a causal relationship between insurance enrollment and FP uptake, but it provides preliminary evidence that such a relationship may exist. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of understanding how specific characteristics of insurance schemes may impact FP use. The population that a scheme chooses to target has important implications for the program’s effectiveness in achieving UHC goals and improving FP access. Many developing countries have initially focused insurance on covering those in the formal sector, who face lower financial barriers to accessing health services. At the same time, payment mechanisms are a key factor in determining provider incentives. Insurance schemes in the countries we examined primarily paid for primary healthcare through capitation, which may disincentive the provision of FP services as a whole, or of specific methods.  </p><p>Our results demonstrate that these schemes have the potential to improve FP access. Proper targeting of populations with the greatest financial barriers to care and alignment of provider incentives to promote and provide FP services are critical for insurance to facilitate greater FP uptake in countries working toward achieving UHC.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The private sector accounts for a large and growing share of the health sector in Kenya. Linking private providers to pro-poor government financing mechanisms is a means of enabling health markets to work for the poor. However, the barriers to entry for small private providers into such schemes can be onerous, and many providers find the requirements prohibitive. </p><p>Under the African Health Markets for Equity (AHME) project, Marie Stopes Kenya built upon its existing social franchising model to offer private clinics in the AMUA network support to navigate the empanelment process for the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Kenya. The number of AMUA empanelled clinics has increased from 32 in 2013 to 152 in 2018. Another 208 are not currently empanelled. </p><p>It might be expected to see an increase in the number of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) provided in AMUA empanelled facilities, with the premise that insurance coverage would relieve clients from cost concerns and allow more women to choose the more costly LARC methods available. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Abt Associate’s recent publication <em>Integrating Family Planning into Universal Health Coverage Efforts </em>(January 2018) notes that greater evidence about the effect of capitation on provider behaviour and the use of the range of family planning services is needed.</p><p>Marie Stopes International, in collaboration with Marie Stopes Kenya, documented AMUA private providers’ experience and perspectives on providing family planning under capitation in Kenya. Among other questions, we investigate why LARC provision is not increasing at a faster rate in AMUA empanelled facilities compared to non-empanelled facilities, as cost should not be a barrier if covered by insurance.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Using DHIS 2 software, we analysed and compared monthly IUCD and implant service data from 92 AMUA facilities before and after NHIF empanelment (April 2016 to December 2017).</p><p>Also, using a case study approach, we collected data from 29 AMUA providers in five counties through a combination of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to gain an understanding of their experiences and perspectives on providing family planning under capitation. Criteria for inclusion in consultations were: willingness to participate, geographic diversity, and facility type, with an emphasis on small and mid-size facilities.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We found that:</p>\t<li>\t<p>Management information system data shows there is no significant differences in long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) uptake before and after NHIF empanelment/contracting in the AMUA network. Most providers consulted at empanelled clinics do not provide any family planning services under capitation.</p>\t<p>While family planning is included in the capitation outpatient service package, its definition is vague. In many instances providers are unsure about whether specific services and methods are covered under capitation.</p>\t<p>Thus, the majority of family planning services are paid out-of-pocket, even when women are enrolled in NHIF. Providers report that many women choose short-acting methods over more expensive LARCs due to the cost.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Providers did not think it economically feasible to include LARCs – implants, specifically – within the outpatient service package, given the low capitation rate received.</p>\t<p>Clinics received some family planning commodities from county and sub-county stores, but inconsistently, and implants were often unavailable.</p>\t<p>Providers who had been involved in previous national output-based aid schemes indicated that the fee-for-service rates under those schemes were attractive and improved LARC access and utilisation.</p>\t</li>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>In Kenya family planning under NHIF outpatient schemes is caught between purchasers’ (organisation that buys health services)) and provider’s motivations for cost containment. This is leading to a provider bias towards short-acting methods and/or out-of-pocket expenditure for family planning services for NHIF clients in the AMUA social franchise network. While capitation is intended to help contain costs and to create positive incentives in the health delivery system, this is not working for family planning.</p><p>Private providers can and should play a central role in systems that enable equitable access to services such as family planning, to progress toward the realisation of universal health coverage. However, blended payment systems (capitation and case-based payment) and reimbursement tariffs must be considered from the outset to ensure that clients have a choice of contraceptives unbiased by concerns of cost.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Universal health coverage (UHC) cannot be achieved if sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is left behind. Countries wishing to meet UHC targets should ensure that access to SRH is truly universal. It should be comprehensive, by combining a broad range of services including health promotion, preventive and curative services; it should be responsive to specific needs of different population groups; and accessible to all, including to the most vulnerable. In Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) commissioned a review of access to SRH services in the context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 by 2030: “Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.”</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study evaluated the achievement of universal access to SRH in six Asia-Pacific countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Thailand and Viet Nam). These countries have committed to move towards UHC by adopting health financing strategies and policies aimed at increasing access and financial protection. To carry out this analysis, a framework disaggregating UHC into three health system goals was used. It considered a) the effective coverage of services; b) equitable access to services; and c) financial risk protection in Asia and the Pacific. Access to SRH services was scrutinized using 11 services as indicators.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>UNFPA’s Asia Pacific Regional Office commissioned mixed methods reviews in six countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Thailand and Viet Nam. The study design included: (a) extensive reviews of both published and grey literature; and (b) key-informant interviews.</p><p>We conducted interviews with FP and SRH policy makers and advocates in each country. Interview questions focused on the coverage of sexual and reproductive health services, including FP services, under the main UHC schemes in each country. The scope of sexual and reproductive health services reviewed in the study is wide but not fully comprehensive. Some essential SRH services are not included, for instance treatment of breast cancer, infertility treatment, support for exclusive breast feeding, and health services for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI) among populations other than adolescents and pregnant women. This leaves out STI and HIV services for men, transgender and intersex persons.</p><p>We analysed data from the literature review and interviews for each country using an analysis framework based on the three health system goals for UHC (effective coverage of; equitable access to; and financial risk protection for sexual and reproductive health services).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<ul>\t<li><strong>Service coverage</strong>\t<ul>\t\t<li>FP expansion restricted rapid population growth in the region. TFR decreased from 5+ in the 70s to ~2.1 (2015). TFRs below the replacement level in some countries, while access to contraception is a challenge in others including Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, Pacific island states, Pakistan, Philippines and Papua New Guinea.</li>\t\t<li>ABR is low compared to the global average but increasing in some countries. Only 20% of sexually active adolescent girls in Asia-Pacific have access to contraceptives and four study countries show increasing adolescent birth rates since 1991.</li>\t\t<li>Major gaps in coverage of cervical cancer screening and prevention, and HPV vaccination. Services for gender-based violence are lacking and only Thailand has scaled up integrated approaches.</li>\t</ul>\t</li>\t<li><strong>Population coverage</strong>\t<ul>\t\t<li>Socioeconomic inequities for FP and maternal health decreased, esp. contraceptive prevalence and satisfied demand.</li>\t\t<li>Place of residence seems main factor; rural and remote areas most disadvantaged in FP access.</li>\t\t<li>Vulnerable groups systematically left behind (ethnic minorities, migrants and refugees) due to stigma, discrimination, language and transport barriers, lack of information, limited coverage in health financing schemes , and cost and availability of services.</li>\t</ul>\t</li>\t<li><strong>Financial risk protection</strong>\t<ul>\t\t<li>Lack of information on public and private spending.</li>\t\t<li>Some services remain uncovered or patients are charged user fees.</li>\t\t<li>High risk pooling fragmentation. Bangladesh and Cambodia pay services using both national budget and third-party payers. Viet Nam and Mongolia ensure pooling by long-established social insurance with premiums and transfers. Thailand has higher degree of pooling and a single purchasing agency.</li>\t</ul>\t</li></ul>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The study provides guidance for governments and development partners to ensure that SRH and FP are a core component of the journey towards UHC. Our results emphasize the need to prioritize adolescents and young women when designing benefits and extending population coverage. Equity should also be a cornerstone of UHC and sexual and reproductive health reforms, with a specific focus on migrant populations. Finally, tackling fragmentation in health financing landscape will contribute to delivering a greater coverage and to facilitating access to sexual and reproductive health services.</p><p>We recommend a number of specific priority actions to enhance both UHC and SRH/FP access: (i) provide FP services coverage under benefits of health financing schemes; (ii) address the overlap and complementarity between UHC and SRH strategies, as well as the areas that are out-of-scope for UHC; (iii) ensure that adolescents have access to contraception, including emergency contraception, HPV immunisation and sexuality education; (iv) ensure health financing mechanisms provide coverage for SRH preventive services such as cervical cancer prevention, prevention of micronutrient malnutrition among adolescent girls and pregnant women, and prevention of HIV infection; (v) promote financial risk protection, risk pooling and high coverage by avoiding complex eligibility requirements, premium structures and tiered subsidies; (vi) prioritise targeted programming to reach very large populations of ethnic minorities, migrant workers and refugees; (vii) increase the evidence-base for UHC and SRH.</p>",

      "title": "Associations between family planning counselling and contraceptive continuation among women in rural Uttar Pradesh, India: findings from a longitudinal study",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family Planning (FP) 2020 is committed to supporting the rights of women and girls to decide, freely, and for themselves, whether, when, and how many children they want to have. In line with such focus on rights-based approach to contraceptive use, one of the strategies adopted by programs across the globe is provision of appropriate counselling on family planning practices to young women. This is backed by prior research, which shows that women receiving structured and balanced contraceptive counselling are more likely to use an effective contraceptive method. However, most of these studies are cross-sectional in nature and research around contraceptive behaviour of women, in terms of continuation and discontinuation of contraceptive methods using longitudinal studies are rare, especially in low and middle income countries.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objective of this study is to examine the association of receipt of counselling on family planning practices by a health provider with modern contraceptive use behaviour among women in rural UP.Contraceptive behaviour in this study was categorised as 1)consistent non- use of modern contraceptives 2) new users of modern contraceptives 3) continued use of modern contraceptives and 4)discontinued use of modern contraceptives. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This is a longitudinal analysis of data from two rounds of survey conducted in 2014 and 2016 respectively. The study adopted a multistage sampling design and data were gathered from women who were married and of the reproductive age (15-49 years). A total of 2222 woman were interviewed in the first round of the study and of the eligible longitudinal respondents, 1770 (80% participation rate) completed interviews in the second round. Women were identified as one of the four categories of the key outcome variable - contraceptive behaviour (consistent non-users, new users, continued users and discontinued users) based on adoption of any modern contraceptive method in round one and round two. </p><p>Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the relationship between counselling and contraceptive behaviour. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders including participant age at marriage, wealth status, literacy, spouse literacy, religion, parity, and presence of a living son. Women who were sterilised during the first round of survey, became pregnant during the second round or were not using contraceptive because they wanted to become pregnant were excluded for these categories.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Modern contraceptive prevalence rate among those interviewed was 36% and 38% during the first round and second round of the survey respectively. The overall modern contraceptive method mix did not change during the course of the study, with female sterilisation constituting around 30% of the contraceptive users in both rounds. Around 21.9% women reported to have received any counselling on family planning practices from a health service provider during the time period between the two rounds of survey. Among women who received any counselling, 14.1% were continued users of modern contraceptive methods whereas 9.9% of women who did not receive any counselling were continued users. Chi-square tests show statistically significant difference in contraceptive use behaviour by receipt of counselling on family planning by health service providers, literacy and caste.</p><p>Women who received family planning counselling had a greater likelihood of being a continued user as opposed to being a consistent non-user (adjusted Risk ratio {aRR}: 1.85 CI: 1.04-3.31). Women receiving counselling were also more likely to be new users of modern methods as opposed to being a consistent non-user (aRR: 2.87 CI: 1.77-4.68), as were women with a living son (aRR: 1.70 CI: 1.00-4.15). Similar results were observed for literate women (aRR:1.57 CI: 1.00-2.92) and non-muslim women (aRR:1.62 CI:1.00-1.87), who were more likely to be continued users of contraceptives.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Receipt of counselling on family planning practices has a significant bearing on contraceptive continuation and discontinuation rates. However, the coverage of family planning counselling is quite low; only one in every five women is receiving the same in rural UP. This supports the need for a need for a focus on counselling programs for improved family planning outcomes. Additionally, socio-demographic characteristics such as religion and literacy also have a significant association with contraceptive usage behaviour. Equity effects should also be taken into consideration while building the counselling programs.</p>",

      "title": "Does health workers’ home to home visit influence women’s modern contraceptive use in Ethiopia? Analysis of PMA2020 Survey ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa with a population of 100 plus million. Ethiopia’s population was growing at a rate of 3.5% per year in 1990 which slowly declined overtime to about 2.5% per year in 2016. Two decades ago the national contraceptive prevalence rate was one of the lowest in the sub-Saharan Africa. Only 3% of women of reproductive age used contraceptive at the time. Over the past one and half decade, the Government of Ethiopia and all the development partners worked extensively to reach more people with comprehensive family planning services. Consequently, contraceptive use, particularly use of modern methods, by married women of reproductive age has significantly increased over the past few years. According to the 2017 PMA2020 estimate, the national modern contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) stands at 36%. Various social, economic and health related factors are known to affect contraceptive utilization. Many researchers believe that increased contraceptive use is achieved through provision of relevant information and proper counseling of users about the available methods including the pros and cons of each method but there was little evidence in Ethiopia whether health workers’ visit of women at home could positively affect their use of contraceptives.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main research question was “Does a home to home visit by health workers increase use of modern contraceptives by married women of reproductive age in Ethiopia?” We hypothesized that women who have received visits from health workers are more likely to be exposed to appropriate information and counseling services about the benefits of contraceptives and hence are more likely to use contraceptives than their counterparts.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The current analysis used a household data from the first three rounds of PMA2020/Ethiopia. PMA2020 is a five-year multi country project that uses innovative mobile technology to monitor key indicators for family planning. The survey used a two-stage cluster design with urban-rural regions as strata. A sample of 200 enumeration areas were drawn by the Central Statistical Agency from its master list. For each EA, 35 households were selected. Households were systematically sampled using a random selection method and those households with eligible females of reproductive age were contacted and those females who consented to participate in the survey were interviewed.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the proportion of married women of reproductive age reporting contraceptive use by the time of the survey. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated to examine the existence and strengths of association between main independent (visit by health workers) and the dependent (modern contraceptive use) variable. The cut-off point for significance level was set at P≤ 0.05. All variables with significant association in the bivariate analysis were loaded into a multivariable logistic regression model to determine independent factor associated with modern contraceptive use. All analyses were done by STATA version 14 software.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Slightly higher proportion of poor women were included in round three <strong>(43%)</strong> compared to the first <strong>(39%)</strong> and second <strong>(40%)</strong> round. Four-fifths of participants were from Oromia followed by participants from Amhara region which account for a quarter of the participants.</p><p></p><p>Modern contraceptive use among married women increased over the survey rounds. Contraceptive prevalence rate among married women has grown from <strong>33.8%</strong> in 2014 to <strong>35.8%</strong> in 2016. This growth has been consistent with a 2% annual increase of CPR shown between 2011 and 2014. The PMA2020’s CPR of <strong>33.8%</strong> in 2014 has shown about 6%-point increase over three years, <strong>27.3%</strong> in 2011 to <strong>33.8%</strong> in 2014. Our finding also showed that short term methods are the most dominant methods being used by married women. Though there is a relative increase in the use of long-term and reversible contraceptive and permanent modern contraceptive methods with corresponding decrease of short-term methods use in Ethiopia, the proportion of long-term and reversible contraceptives users are very limited compared to the short-term methods users. Overall, about a quarter of married women of reproductive age <strong>(24.8%)</strong> have been visited by health workers at home during the last three rounds of the PMA2020 survey. The finding showed that married women of reproductive age who were visited by health workers were about <strong>40%</strong> more likely to use modern contraceptive methods, <strong>[AOR 1.39, 95%CI (1.22, 1.58)],</strong> compared to those who were not visited after controlling for other variables such as age, education, marital status and wealth.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The current analysis showed that there is a growing trend in the prevalence of modern contraceptive use among married women of reproductive age in Ethiopia with 2%-point increase annually. The 2%-point annual increase is a sign of a well-functioning family planning program that must be encouraged. Visit by health workers were associated with higher odds of modern contraceptive use by married women of reproductive age after controlling for important confounding variable including age, education, wealth status and parity of the respondents. Health workers who made a visit to a household may take more time to provide information and counseling services about existing contraceptive methods and explain the pros and cons of each method to the women and would probably do this in a way that convince women to adopt the method. Health workers may not spend adequate time with clients’ counseling services in health facilities because of client load and the possibility of being engaged with other additional clinical activities. Ethiopia must strengthen the existing practices of a house-to-house visit of women and their families with a tailored and targeted family planning information and services to strengthen its primary health care service delivery and particularly to positively influence modern contraceptive use by married women of reproductive age.</p>",

      "title": "Fertility of the elite in Sub-Saharan Africa: Do country fertility and family planning contexts matter?",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Lower fertility has long been identified in both economic and historical demography literature as a defining characteristic of “middle class” behaviour (Banerjee and Duflo 2008). In SSA today, the only class having attained this universal so-called “middle class” status is arguably its elite – i.e. those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy (wealth and education). The strong relationship between educational attainment (the main contributor to our proxy for social hierarchy status) and lower fertility is well documented (Bongaarts 2003). Many theories have been proposed to explain this relationship, including increased women’s empowerment among more educated women, their increased ability to break social norms promoting high fertility, and better access to and use of contraception. Low fertility, by sub-Saharan African (SSA) standards a TFR </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Do middle class/elite women in SSA have similar fertility levels, regardless of the national fertility and family planning contexts in which they find themselves? Or is low fertility found only among elite women in wealthier countries with lower overall fertility and stronger family planning (FP) programs? We hypothesize that, following theories from the historical/economic literature, elites have attained low fertility in every country of SSA, regardless of the stage of fertility and contraceptive transitions in their country.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We use the most recent DHS data from countries in West, East, and Central Africa that had a survey carried out since 2008, for a sample of 409,402 women of reproductive age from 30 countries. From this sample, we create two categories of women: 1) “elites”: those with completed secondary education (or higher) who are also in the wealthiest quintile and 2) “non-elites”: all other women. We first present descriptive characteristics of the elite and non-elite, then calculate TFR for both groups by country, and then show the relationships between elite TFR (at the country level) and several characteristics related to fertility outcomes in these countries (e.g., overall TFR, desired family sizes, overall modern contraceptive prevalence rate (MCPR), unmet need, and median age at first birth). We then examine the relationship between elite TFR and two country-level socio-economic indicators: women's educational achievement and GDP. Last, we preform multivariate regression analysis with an outcome variable of number of children born in the past three years, and include both individual and contextual variables to assess whether and to what extent elite fertility outcomes depend on country-level characteristics, with a focus on MCPR, method mix, and unmet need.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We find 9% of women across SSA fit our “elite” category, corresponding closely to the share of the African population estimated to live on more than $10 a day (ABD 2014). Elite women are found predominately but not exclusively in urban areas. Among married/in union women, educational attainment of secondary schooling or higher is nearly universal among their partners, implying that elite women are generally part of elite couples. </p><p>On average, elite TFR is 2.9 children less than that of non-elites, though there is noticeable variation in the elite TFR levels across countries. While two-thirds of the analysis countries have elite TFR 6), elite fertility is much lower than the country TFR but still relatively high compared to elites in other countries. However, in countries that have started the transition (TFR </p><p>The next stage of the analysis will use both multi-level regression models and the Bongaarts proximate determinants model to examine differences in proximate determinants of fertility, with a focus on contraceptive use, between elites and non-elites.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The finding that TFR across SSA countries is consistently and substantially lower among the elite points to similarities in the profile of elite women throughout the region that results in their lower fertility, regardless of local fertility and family planning contexts. This in turn suggests that as elite or middle-class populations grow, so will family planning use and desires for smaller families. However, the substantial variation across countries in the elite TFR, from a below-replacement level of 1.33 to a high of 3.82, indicates there are still be significant differences fertility desires or access to FP (and abortion) among the elite in different countries. This finding that country-level socio-economic factors appear to impact overall elite fertility levels may have relevance for country-specific FP programs approaches and strategies, especially in the highest fertility countries. Since “elite” women tend to be the vanguards of family planning use and fertility decline in a country, understanding similarities and differences in elite fertility across SSA, and their potential impact on country-level family planning use and fertility decline, could have important implications for future uptake of FP and declines in family size throughout the region. When it comes to understanding aggregate fertility declines, it may be as important to investigate and understand fertility of the elite, a group often overlooked by FP research, as it is to focus on the more disadvantaged groups within a country.</p>",

      "title": "How Health Extension Workers Increased Uptake of Modern Contraception in one Ethiopian Community: A Case Study",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In the last decade, the proportion of married Ethiopian women using contraceptive methods has increased substantially from 14% in 2005 to 35% in 2016. Numerous factors have contributed to the increased uptake, including the implementation of the Health Extension Program (HEP), a public-sector health service delivery strategy that has deployed approximately 39,000 health extension workers (HEWs) throughout the country. Operationalized in 2004, the community-based Health Extension Program  delivers health education and a range of primary health care services, including family planning, to rural areas. HEWs are recruited from within their own community to ensure delivery of locally needed care and to facilitate trust between the community and the HEWs. In contrast to the prevailing practice in other low-income countries, HEWs in Ethiopia are salaried and receive one full year of training based on a curriculum developed by a team of national and international experts. The program adopts a diffusion model, which posits that community change occurs incrementally, by training early adopters first and then moving to the next group that may be ready to change. Although the Health Extension Program has had impact evaluations, several calls have been made to document the process as a successful family planning service delivery platform. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Using a case study approach, this research characterizes how the family planning component in Ethiopia’s Health Extension Program contributes to increasing contraceptive use in one rural community. Specifically, we provide rich insights into the content of the family planning messages, whom they are being delivered to, and how they are received by the community.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In July and August 2016, we conducted qualitative research in the Oromiya region in Ethiopia. We conducted five focus groups and thirteen individual in-depth interviews with men, women, adolescents, and key informants (including health extension workers) in a rural area in Oromia, Ethiopia (n=59). Oromia is one of the nine (and the largest) ethnically-based regions of Ethiopia where over 90% of residents live in rural areas. We chose Oromia because it exemplifies an increase in family planning use and drop in fertility. We used a random sampling protocol to recruit all participants except key informants, who were selected through purposive sampling techniques to ensure high knowledge about family planning in the community. Interviews were audio recorded, translated, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo v.11 qualitative research software. We adopted a thematic analysis, an inductive set of procedures designed to identify and examine emerging themes from conceptual data.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We identified four main themes that help explain uptake of modern contraception. Theme 1 - High levels of acceptance of the family planning services provided by HEWs in the study setting. One participant from a men’s focus group iterated this sentiment, “<em>Previously people consulted traditional midwifery. Now they even discuss the secrets that they don’t tell their husbands with the health extension workers</em>.” Theme 2 - HEWs focused on changing behaviors to increase spacing between births rather than limiting family size or delaying first births. A mothers’ focus group participant commented, “<em>You know, it was great problem in the past when we didn’t know. But, now we are spacing our births and most women are doing so in our community</em>.” Theme 3 - HEWs framed the spacing message as “healthy” for mother and baby but only targeted married women who have already given birth. One adolescent girl’s statement during a focus group illustrates this point, “<em>Giving birth frequently without gaps affects the mothers’ physical health and their health in general</em>.” And Theme 4 - HEWs effectively delivered family planning messages to everyone in the community, including men, women, adolescents, and religious leaders. A participant in a mother’s focus group said, “<em>Husbands were not positive at initial period, but as time goes on, those health professionals are also giving advice to males as well</em>.” According to a HEW, “<em>Religious leaders were also given repeated training and awareness. After that, they never complained about using contraceptives to space births at all</em>.”</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>While the HEWs have been effective in changing attitudes and behaviors related to family planning, as observed in our data, their success may be attributable to two important factors. First, they adopt a strategy of incremental change. Our data show that the HEP focuses on less controversial approaches to increasing family planning uptake, for example, among married women, advising use of contraception after birth of their first child to plan and space future births). Second, they cast a wide net of influencers. For example, the HEWs engage men and religious leaders, who comprise a seemingly less traditional group to bring into conversations about contraception use. Although religious leaders, adolescents, and unmarried women are all included in community dialogue about family planning, unmarried women and female adolescents may not be included as primary contraception users themselves, if social norms do not approve of their sexual activity. Our study shows that the HEW family planning program as administered in this community benefitted from these approaches. As shown by prior impact evaluations and corroborated by this study, HEWs are an effective vehicle to transfer information and ideas. Changing social norms is a difficult endeavor and understanding where to begin and which subsequent steps to take is critical. Focusing efforts on acceptance of family planning for spacing among married women can be an effective initial approach. Understanding these granular aspects of the HEW family planning program in one local context may help explain how use of contraception has increased in Ethiopia as a whole.</p>",

      "title": "Improved contraceptive use among women and men in Uganda: A repeated cross-sectional population study for the years 1995-2016",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In 2015, Uganda had a maternal mortality ratio of 343 deaths per 100,000 live births. Many of these deaths arise from unsafe abortions that are the result of unintended or unwanted pregnancies. These deaths would be largely preventable, if women are better able to use and access effective contraceptive options.</p><p>Though Uganda has seen improvements in the uptake of contraception over the last decade, unmet need remains at 34.3% among all women of reproductive age. Almost 60% of women surveyed in Uganda have ‘short’ spacing of less than 24 months between births. Among post-partum women, 25% currently used contraception; significantly more experienced unmet need for contraception with 41% seeking longer spacing between births and a 27% wishing to limit the number of births. </p><p>Research on changes in contraceptive behaviour over time in Uganda is scarce; one study has previously looked at this for women, and it has not been done before for men. Understanding contraceptive behaviours of both women and men and the motivations that drive these are key to tackling unmet need, by way of better designing, implementing and improving family planning programs and messages to effectively address the reproductive health needs of different population groups.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This epidemiological study sets out to address the above gap in the literature, by analysing changes in contraceptive use over time, among both women and men of reproductive age in Uganda. Five Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) datasets for Uganda, for the 21 years between 1995 and 2016, were used in for the analysis. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The DHS datasets are nationally representative population-based surveys that employ a stratified two-stage cluster design. Clusters are selected from the most recent population census sample frame and households are subsequently and systematically selected from the clusters. Participants eligible for interview include all women aged 15–49 years and men aged 15–54 years who are residents of the selected household. </p><p>Individual data from 7070 women in 1995, 7246 women in 2000/2001, 8531 women in 2006, 8674 women in 2011, and 19000 women in 2016 were collected. Similarly, individual data were collected from 1996 men in 1995, 1962 men in 2000/2001, 2503 men in 2006, 2295 men in 2011, and 5000 men in 2016. The surveys use standardized questionnaires specifically for women, men and households; these are administered during face-to-face interviews. </p><p>Contraceptive use in this study was classified as no method, any modern method (including male and female condoms, contraceptive pills, injectables, intrauterine devices (IUDs), male and female sterilisation, emergency contraception pills, the lactational amenorrhoea method and the standard days method) or any method (including traditional, folkloric and modern methods).</p><p>Weighted quadratic regression analyses were used to determine if there were significant changes in the use of contraception among women and men across the years 1995-2016.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In 2016, 30.3% of all women, and 39.9% of all men of reproductive age in Uganda, were using a contraceptive method, an increase from 13.4% of women and 20.3% of men, respectively, in 1995. Furthermore, 27.3% of all women and 35.9% of all men were using a modern method of contraception in 2016, an increase from 7.4% of women and 10.4% of men respectively, in 1995.</p><p>For the weighted regression analyses, both linear and quadratic models were explored to investigate both linear and non-linear patterns in the rate of change in contraception usage over the study period. For women using any method of contraception, both linear and quadratic terms were statistically significant (p2 for each year after 1995. Similarly, for women using a modern method of contraception, both linear and quadratic terms were also statistically significant (p2.</p><p>For men using any method of contraception, the quadratic term was statistically significant (p2. For men using a modern method of contraception, both terms were statistically significant (p2.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This is the first epidemiological study of its kind that has looked at changes in contraceptive use over the last 21 years, particularly among men, who have been a largely understudied population. The findings from this study provide evidence that the rate of change of contraceptive use is relatively higher in later years than in earlier years, pointing to the greater impact of  family planning programs and interventions, and the resulting behaviour change of populations. The results could further inform and improve reproductive health programs and policies moving forward; aligning with the Ugandan Government’s Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan 2015-2020, which seeks to reduce “unmet need for family planning to 10% and to increase the modern contraceptive prevalence rate to 50% by 2020”.</p><p>The findings from this study will also be used to provide feedback and guide program development and implementation for the District Health teams that oversee reproductive health services in the Iganga and Luuka districts of the Busoga region of East Uganda, which is the study site for a related implementation-based study. The findings will be shared with public and private health centres, as well as NGOs and community health workers that offer family planning services to communities with high unmet need for contraception.</p><p>The results above also motivate the need for further work in this area, particularly a predictive model based on the most recent data from the 2016 DHS, to identify demographic predictors for contraceptive use among women and men in Uganda.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>India’s demographics are of global significance. With more than 1.3 billion people, India accounts for a sixth of the world’s population, and will become the world’s most populous nation by 2024. These numbers however, conceal remarkable temporal and spatial variation. Since 1990, India’s fertility rate has fallen from 3.8 to 2.3 (Government of India, 2017).  12 Indian states have reached replacement level fertility, and others have also experienced steep fertility decline.  Contraceptive prevalence rates have also increased, but not always where fertility has fallen: in 8 states of India, declines in fertility has occurred despite a decline in modern contraception prevalence (IIPS 2016). </p><p></p><p>Understanding the drivers of these trends requires considering India’s spatial variations. This paper aims to examine the geographical pattern of change in the contraceptive use at the level of 640 Indian districts. Indian districts are typically quite large, including a population of an average of 2 million people. Districts are also of significant administrative importance. Linking together several datasets, aggregated at the district level, provides new insights into the spatial variations in demographic and socio-economic changes. We examine how changes in contraceptive prevalence are associated with the socioeconomic development during the past two decades.</p>",

      "methodology": "<p>The data from three rounds of DLHS (1998-99, 2002-04 and 2007-08) and NFHS-4 (2015-16)  is used to generate the district level estimates. Additionally, Census, 2001 and 2011 is also used to obtain district level values of population density, average household size, sex ratio and female work participation.</p><p><em>Outcomes:</em> CPR and mCPR are used as the measures of current contraceptive use.</p><p><em>Predictors: </em></p>\t<li>Socioeconomic: Population density, % SC/ST, %Muslim, female literacy, mean consumer expenditure, female workforce participation</li>\t<li>demographic: sex ratio, mean age at marriage, average household size</li>\t<li>Health care utilization: ANC visits</li><p>Our analysis proceeds in several stages.

      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, the contraceptive use have increased substantially in India between 1998-99 and 2015-16. However, the findings reveal notable intra-district variations in the change in contraceptive use as measured by CPR and mCPR across districts over time, where some districts have registered positive changes whereas many have shown a decline in the contraceptive prevalence rates. The correlation between change in contraceptive prevalence rates and respective initial values was negative which lends support to the hypothesis that districts with lower contraceptive prevalence have recorded higher change in the contraceptive prevalence. Furthermore, it is worth noting there that the strength of this correlation varied across time points.</p><p>The multivariate regression analysis to examine the factors leading to change in the contraceptive prevalence between DLHS-1 (1998-99) and DLHS-2 (2002-04) show that change in the %urban, female literacy, % muslim, mean age at marriage, ANC visits (3+) and sex ratio had significant association with the change in CPR. Also, after controlling for state level fixed effects and initial level of CPR and levels socioeconomic and demographic indicators in model 3, the effect of female literacy, %muslim, ANC visit (3+) and sex ratio remained significant. These results provide strong support for the robustness of the results. Moreover, these factors highly significant for our analysis of change between DLHS-1 to DLHS-3 and DLHS-1 to DLHS-4.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Given, the fact that contraceptive use in India has improved substantially, there exists a vast literature exploring factors associated with contraceptive use in India. However, most of the analyses have used unit level data to explore associated factors and there has not been a systematic analysis of variations at district level contraceptive use and the changes in it over time. Therefore, the findings from this maiden attempt contribute to the literature on district-level variations and spatial inequalities in the demographic changes in India. The findings further highlight the role of socioeconomic and demographic development in bringing about long-term change in the overall contraceptive use. In the light of FP2020 goal of reaching 48 million new users in India, the findings from this study have important implications for policy to improve contraceptive uptake by highlighting the key regions/districts to target and factors which have been most important in bringing about macro level changes.</p>",

      "title": "Analyse du choix de contraception moderne en Afrique. Une approche par l'indice de contraception mixte",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>La pratique de la contraception moderne, bien qu’elle se soit nettement améliorée en Afrique, reste sujette à d’énormes disparités entre les pays du continent. En effet, la prévalence contraceptive moderne dans la région varie d’un minimum de 1,7% au Sud Soudan à un maximum de 65,8% au Zimbabwe (ONU, 2018). Toutefois, cette distribution inégale des taux de prévalence contraceptive moderne masque une autre problématique non moins importante : la possibilité pour les femmes, même dans une situation de faible utilisation, de choisir parmi une diversité de méthodes de contraception moderne mises à leur disposition. Cette possibilité, qui peut être comprise à travers le concept de contraception moderne mixte, a ceci d’intéressant qu’elle introduit la notion de choix, et donc de liberté, et peut conduire à terme les utilisatrices des contraceptifs à choisir parmi une gamme de méthodes et sur la base des informations liées à chacune d’elles, la méthode de contraception moderne qui répond le mieux à leurs besoins et à leurs objectifs de planification familiale.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Cet article répond à la question suivante : comment se présentent en Afrique les disparités de la contraception moderne mixte au regard de celles observées dans les taux de prévalence contraceptive moderne ? Nous supposons que ce ne sont pas toujours les pays pour lesquels le taux de prévalence contraceptive est élevé qui enregistrent les meilleurs scores dans la distribution des choix de contraception modernes.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>L’étude porte sur les 54 pays du continent africain. Elle utilise les données du « world contraceptive use 2018 » compilées par la Division de la Population du Département des Affaires Economiques et Sociales des Nations-Unies. Les données les plus récentes sur la prévalence contraceptive moderne et les prévalences par type de méthodes ont été extraites. Il s’agit des données des dernières enquêtes démographiques et de santé (EDS) ou par grappes à indicateurs multiples (MICS) réalisées dans les différents pays. Pour mesurer le degré avec lequel les femmes utilisent une gamme de méthodes au niveau de chaque pays, le DELIVER PROJECT de l’USAID a élaboré en 2010 un indice de contraception mixte. Ce dernier est obtenu en rapportant la différence entre le taux de prévalence de la méthode la plus utilisée et celui de la troisième méthode la plus utilisée, au taux global de prévalence contraceptive moderne. Une valeur élevée de l’indice signifie que le choix est concentré sur une faible gamme de méthodes, et inversement lorsque la valeur est basse, de sorte que dans un pays, si toutes les femmes utilisaient une seule méthode, l’indice serait de 100, et de 0 si elles utilisaient toutes les méthodes.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Les pays ont été classés selon leur degré plus ou moins élevé du choix de contraception moderne. Ce classement a été rendu possible par une catégorisation issue du continuum de valeurs de l’indice de contraception mixte. Ainsi, les pays ayant un indice supérieur à 60 sont ceux dont le choix de contraception moderne est le plus faible, avec une concentration forte du choix sur une méthode. Les pays dont l’indice est compris entre 30 et 60 sont ceux où le choix de contraception moderne est moyen, avec une concentration moyenne du choix sur une méthode. Enfin, les pays dont l’indice est inférieur à 30 sont ceux où le choix de contraception est élevé, avec une concentration faible du choix sur une méthode.</p><p>Globalement, les résultats montrent que la contraception moderne mixte n’est pas encore encrée dans les habitudes des utilisatrices en Afrique, puisque la majorité des pays ont un indice supérieur à 30. Par ailleurs et ce qui est le plus frappant, on se serait attendu à ce que les pays qui ont fait le plus de progrès en matière de pratique contraceptive moderne soient également ceux dont le choix contraceptif est le plus diversifié. Mais cette relation ne se vérifie pas en Afrique. Dans bien des cas, les pays ont des taux de prévalence contraceptive moderne élevés sans pour autant que leur indice de contraception mixte soit faible, et donc une forte pratique contraceptive moderne ne garantit pas toujours un choix contraceptif diversifié en Afrique.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Cette étude permet de constater qu’en Afrique, la notion de choix fait encore largement défaut dans la pratique contraceptive moderne. Ce résultat suscite des interrogations à deux niveaux :</p><ul>\t<li>D’un côté, sur la qualité des informations fournies aux utilisatrices par les prestataires des services de planification familiale, relatives aux avantages et inconvénients de chacune des options de contraception disponible ;</li>\t<li>De l’autre, sur les contraintes culturelles et socioéconomiques du déploiement optimal d’un choix contraceptif mixte dans les pays africains.</li></ul><p>Or, il est de plus en plus admis que la diversité du choix de contraception moderne est un mécanisme d’accélération de la pratique contraceptive moderne en Afrique, car c’est par lui que les femmes ayant une demande de planification familiale sont en mesure de savoir quelle est la méthode contraceptive qui réalise le mieux leurs objectifs de procréation, et qui cadre le mieux avec les impératifs contextuels dans lesquels elles sont immergées. Des réflexions devraient donc être engagées ou approfondies sur cette problématique.</p>",

      "title": "Implementing Voluntary, Rights-based Family Planning: Experience from Nigeria and Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>This presentation describes two first of their kind interventions that operationalized voluntary, rights-based family planning (VRBFP) approaches at the service delivery level.  Implementation research associated with the interventions measured all dimensions of VRBFP (acceptability; accessibility; availability, quality; accountability; agency, autonomy and empowerment, equity/non-discrimination; informed choice; participation; and privacy/confidentiality).  Interventions were implemented by Reproductive Health Uganda (RHU) in Uganda and by Palladium in Kaduna State, Nigeria. In 2016, RHU implemented a project in four districts of Uganda to operationalize the Government’s commitment to VRBFP, operating at policy, service delivery and community levels.  Starting in 2016, Palladium implemented a package of VRBFP interventions across Kaduna state, targeting four levels of programming, with a dominant focus on service delivery. Evaluations of the interventions used a common tool - the VRBFP service delivery measurement tool.  The presentation includes lessons learned about implementing and measuring VRBFP programming.   </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Implementation of the interventions were assessed using a case study approach in Uganda, with a baseline and midline conducted in four public sector health facilities in three districts to assess the effects of the service delivery component of the VRBFP intervention.  The facility audit, provider interviews and client exit interviews from the VRBFP Service Delivery Measurement Tool were used. In Nigeria, implications for future VRBFP programming were identified through: pre- and post- tests for all training events; mentorship logbooks; and, FGD with treatment facility health providers. For the evaluation in Kaduna, using the VRBFP Service Delivery Measurement Tool, data were collected from the 15 intervention facilities and from seven control sites at baseline and at endline. The quantitative tool comprised four modules: a facility assessment; interviews with facility health providers (baseline n=37, endline n=40); exit interviews with facility clients (baseline n=429, endline n=444); and simulated client visits (four visits in each facility at baseline, and again at endline). </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In Uganda, at health facility-level, RHU trained healthcare providers on FP counselling and rights literacy; conducted supervision with providers; oriented facility management committees to their roles and to VRBFP; and helped facility staff to implement action plans for strengthening VRBFP.   In Kaduna State, three service-level interventions were executed across 15 primary healthcare treatment facilities: trained providers and supervisors on the VRBFP approach and built their rights literacy; developed year-long facility-level action plans in pursuit of VRBFP principles; and, supported implementation of facility action plans through a 12-month mentorship program.  Treatment facilities observed an increase in contraceptive uptake during the intervention period, with no corresponding increase in control facilities. Moreover, statistically significant improvements were observed in treatment sites across several rights indicators. For example, there was significantly less provider bias against adolescents, unmarried women, and women who wish to use contraception without their husband’s permission. Clients’ confidentiality was increasingly protected, they were more actively engaged in their own care, and providers increasingly sought their opinions about the facility and services. Importantly, providers and clients were more aware of the conditions that constitute rights vulnerabilities or abuses, and what to do if these behaviors occur; they were also more willing to report violations.   </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These interventions demonstrate how rights can be mainstreamed within services.  Six learning points to strengthen VRBFP programming at the service delivery level were identified from Uganda: Expertise and knowledge of multiple actors during planning/project design are essential to success; Change starts at the implementing organization; Targeted training on rights, as part of an existing curriculum, can effectively generate attitudinal and behavioural change;  Supervision tailored to VRBFP has the potential to strengthen basic quality; Working at the service level is necessary but not sufficient for implementing VRBFP; and, To successfully operationalize VRBFP, basic health systems standards need to be in place.  The Kaduna experience adds:  Successful absorption of the approach requires translating theory into practice; A weak health system imposes a ceiling on the extent to which rights can be realized within facilities; The importance of identifying creative solutions in a weak health system; and, Supervision is essential for reinforcing rights in facilities.</p><p>The results show that taking a voluntary, rights-based approach to FP can improve clients’ experiences with services and increase contraceptive uptake.  Operationalizing the VRBFP model in other contexts requires careful consideration of the broader health system, and simultaneous efforts across policy-, service delivery-, community-, and individual levels in order to creatively tackle deficiencies and externalities. The measurement tool, modified based on experience using it, will be useful for programs to monitor adherence to VRBFP. Tools used in the interventions, e.g. training manuals, BCC materials, etc. will be useful for other programs. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Unintended pregnancy is a significant health issue, with recent estimates of 44% of pregnancies worldwide being unintended.

      "methodology": "<p>ACCORd is a cluster randomised controlled trial involving family physicians (FPs) in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, and their female patients with FPs randomised to either intervention or control.

      "title": "Exploring the relationship between contraceptive use and violence during pregnancy from a continuum perspective in India.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Previous research in South Asia has documented the serious, but heterogeneous, relationship between marital violence and contraceptive use.  Violence during pregnancy compromises not only the health and human rights of a woman, but also of her unborn child. An estimated 7.8 women million and their children in India are affected by this targeted form of abuse.  Contraception is a tool that some women use to regulate their desired fertility in circumstances of abuse, an approach in which women may tend to use more covert forms of contraception to retain decision-making control in a context of spousal disempowerment.  While contraception in India has been dominated by female sterilization, the most common form of spacing contraception is condom use (9%), a method dependent on cooperation from the male partner. There is thus a need for deeper understanding of the relationship between abuse during pregnancy and contraceptive use from a life course continuum perspective, to better support access to appropriate contraceptive options for women in India.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aims to examine the relationship between abuse during pregnancy and contraceptive use prior and subsequent to that pregnancy, as well as with pregnancy outcomes in India, a country with low spacing contraceptive use and moderate levels of intimate partner violence.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This analysis used data from India’s National Family Health Survey’s 2015-16 wave, a nationally representative survey assessing demographic, economic, health and social indicators from women of reproductive age (15-49).  Variables were drawn from the contraceptive calendar and violence module, to assess contraceptive use and abuse during pregnancy.  As abuse during pregnancy, measured as physical violence, was assessed as an “ever/never” measure, only women with one lifetime pregnancy were included, to pinpoint the pregnancy being referred to with the abuse during pregnancy response.  The subsample was further restricted to women for whom that single pregnancy began at least six months subsequent to the beginning of the contraceptive calendar, and ended at least six months prior to the end of the contraceptive calendar, to allow time for pre-pregnancy and postpartum contraception (n=4,567).  Variables assessed included experiences of physical violence during the index pregnancy (yes/no), contraceptive use within the contraceptive calendar window but prior to that pregnancy (pre-pregnancy contraception), contraceptive use subsequent to the index pregnancy (postpartum contraception), whether or not there was an ultrasound associated with the index pregnancy (yes/no), and outcome of the index pregnancy (birth, miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion).  Descriptive and regression analyses adjusted for survey design and weights.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, 2.5% of women in the sample reported abuse during their index pregnancy.  Index pregnancies largely resulted in births, with 1.4% miscarriages among women reporting abuse during pregnancy and 3.7% miscarriages in counterparts not reporting abuse; the latter group also reported 1% or fewer stillbirths and abortions.  The majority of women did not report pre-pregnancy contraception (90.5% and 90.9%, for no / any abuse during pregnancy, respectively).  Postpartum contraception was more common, with 44.9% of women not reporting abuse during pregnancy using postpartum contraception (31.7% modern and 12.3% traditional) and 36.1% of women reporting any abuse during pregnancy reporting postpartum contraception (31.1% modern and 5.0% traditional).  Postpartum contraception among women not reporting abuse was primarily condom (35.9%), followed by pill (24.4%), periodic abstinence/rhythm method (13.7%) and withdrawal (13.4%).  Among women who reported abuse during pregnancy, postpartum contraception was majority pill (48.0%) and IUD (23.4%), followed by condom (14.7%) and withdrawal (10.7%). </p><p></p><p>Multivariate analyses, adjusting for age and household wealth, indicate no association between pre-pregnancy contraception and abuse during pregnancy.  Women who experienced abuse during pregnancy had a four times higher odds of live birth vs. termination (aOR=4.1, p=0.03), accounting for ultrasounds, which also had four times higher odds of birth than termination (aOR=4.0, p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Women reporting abuse during pregnancy had heavier use of non-partner dependent, possibly covert, postpartum contraception than women who did not report violence.  This abuse was not associated with contraception in the window surrounding pregnancy; as this was assessed as “physical hurt”, this is consistent with previous research showing a relationship between sexual, but not physical violence, and subsequent contraception.1 The association between abuse during pregnancy and live births is echoed in other findings indicating that in some contexts, the effects of abuse during pregnancy may be greater following birth, rather than on birth itself.5</p><p></p><p>Pre-pregnancy and postpartum contraception were strongly associated with one another, consistent with other research in South Asia,6,7 and indicating a possible life-course benefit to early contraceptive access and engagement. Women with live births were more likely to use postpartum contraception; as this analysis focused on women’s first pregnancies, this may be in part be because women who miscarried or had stillbirths thus had no children in a country where the wanted fertility rate stands at 1.8 (abortions were reported in 3  The positive association between ultrasound and live births is consistent with other research on son preference indicating that first births are largely random and less vulnerable to gender bias than subsequent births.8,9 Postpartum contraception, a critical component of empowering women to achieve their desired fertility, is informed by the reproductive and personal history of women.  Taking this continuum into consideration is an important step in improving appropriate, effective contraceptive access and availability.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Violence based on sex and gender impacts reproductive autonomy, including sexual behaviours, fertility intentions, and family planning (FP) use. </p><p> </p><p>Although FP is an element of SGBV guidelines and vice versa, linkages are not always prioritized where women seek services. Following unprotected sex, including rape, women and girls do not routinely have access to EC: it is not offered at the same rate as HIV prophylaxis; it may be dispensed in an FP clinic that is closed late at night and on weekends. With high levels of violence, including among children, and unmet need for FP, improving the integration of FP and SGBV services will have better outcomes for women and girls. </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In April 2016, a regional technical meeting was held to help six African countries meet their obligations under the Maputo Protocol to protect and promote the reproductive rights of women and girls, with emphasis on survivors of sexual violence and IPV, including prevention of pregnancy.  For the Kenya delegation’s Plan of Action, one goal was to increase access to EC by producing a Ministerial Circular to raise stakeholder awareness of the issue. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The main objective of the circular was to target high-level health stakeholders in order to reorganize the distribution of EC pills within public health facilities and clinics to improve access and uptake by sexual violence survivors, 24 hours/7 days a week, free of charge, and as quickly as possible. </p><p>Methods included the regional technical meeting, with 5 other participating countries, technical assistance and on-site work planning to develop country approaches. The regional experience, with WHO and other global guidance, provided a robust foundation for proposing the national approach of disseminating an EC circular, working within the decentralized context to target the 47 county level ministers of health, county directors of health and all health facility management committees, with the endorsement of the Council of Governors.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In February 2018, the Director of Medical Services in Kenya sent out a Ministerial Circular on “Improving access to emergency contraception by survivors of sexual violence.” </p><p> </p><p>According to this guidance, EC pills should be made accessible and available from additional sites within health facilities, including outpatient, inpatient and comprehensive care centres. This broadens availability from the usual channel of family planning clinics--usually in a separate location from outpatient clinics and emergency rooms, and only operating during daytime business hours. The circular also highlights the importance of capacity building and continuing medical education for EC.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>The implications following the regional technical technical meeting and following the Kenyan experience highlight the broader question of strengthening the integration between FP and SGBV services, across the points where women and girls seek services, whether they are seeking one or the other service.</p><p></p><p>Improved systems of interlinkages between these two areas will strengthen both FP and SGBV programming. More comprehensive and integrated services to clients can improve coordination, training, screening for SGBV, FP uptake, data collection, policies, procedures, supply chain, use of resources, and ultimately outcomes for women and girls. </p><p> </p><p>The Kenyan experience of creating a Ministerial Circular for improved EC access highlights one approach to high-level stakeholder advocacy and making them aware of the key barriers which are faced by survivors and solutions to those. Further advocacy and programming efforts are needed to improve FP providers’ training to screen for SGBV and post-rape care responders to address unmet FP needs, including EC and possibilities for quick-starting to ongoing methods of contraception, thereby improving contraceptive uptake overall. It also highlights one approach to FP advocacy in a decentralized state and and across the range of settings under the health jurisdiction where women and girls are, including rural areas, and camps for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs).</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Deceit or inducement into sexual activities without the victim having a clue of the intended action is common in tertiary institutions as the environment promote activities which makes students vulnerable especially females, young and new students. The resulting physical, psychological and social consequences like; harassment, sexual assault, non-consensual sex, injury, psychological trauma and even suicide attempt have affected many young people. The vulnerability of young persons and the grooming process employed by the perpetrators who present themselves as empathetic and compassionate friends that offer help in difficult or straining situations renders them powerless to recognize the exploitative nature of the relationship and inability to give informed consent. This study therefore aimed at exploring the knowledge, perception and experience of sexual entrapment among undergraduate students of the University of Ibadan Nigeria to determine the commonality of the problem, identify the contributing factors and suggest interventions to reduce this practice in higher institutions.</p>",

      "methodology": "<p>This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey that utilized mix-method. A three-stage sampling technique which involved random, proportionate and systematic technique was used to select 422 undergraduate students residing in halls of residence between August 2017 and February, 2018. Quantitative data was collected using a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire with five (5) sections; socio-demographics, Knowledge, perception, experience and outcome/coping with sexual entrapment. Knowledge was measured on a 24-point scale; score of &gt;19 was classified as good, 12-18 as fair and &gt;10 was classified as good. Coping mechanism was measured on 11-point scale; score of &gt;7was classified as effective. Qualitative data was collected using an In-depth interview (IDI) guide from 18 consented participants identified to have experienced sexual entrapment from the questionnaire to explore their experience. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi square at p=0.05 on SPSS while Qualitative data was analyzed thematically.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Mean age of respondents was 20.5+3.0 years and 52.6% were males. More than half (58.8%) had a good knowledge on sexual entrapment with 72.5% having a good knowledge of the modes of sexual entrapment, 71.6% of the tactics of sexual entrapment and 54.4% on the causes, victims, perpetrator, experience and consequences of sexual entrapment. Eighty-one percent had a good perception on sexual entrapment with 40.8% and 83.4% perceiving it as serious and a threat respectively, 44.1% perceived some categories of persons as being susceptible, 89.3% perceived sexual entrapment as being beneficial in satisfying sexual desires and 83.2% agreed to the suggested perceived ways of preventing sexual entrapment. Prevalence of sexual entrapment was 18% with more males than females though not statistically significant (p=0.700) with 47.4% experiencing more than one form of sexual entrapment. Students were entrapped on campus through; emotional support (42.1%), money (34.2%), accommodation assistance (7.9%), material things/gifts (21.1%), assignment assistance (10.5%), help with registration (4.0%), religious activities (6.6%), debt repayment (11.8%) and counseling (9.2%). Majority (59.2%) were entrapped by friends, first year students experience sexual entrapment more on campus (39.5%). It resulted to; unwanted sex (34%), rape (4%), pregnancy (1.3%), STDs (4%), Injury (13%), psychological trauma (27.6%), loss of trust (52.6%) and attempted suicide (23.7%) among victims. Effective and ineffective coping mechanisms were adopted by 55.3% and 44.7% respectively. The findings from the In-depth interview supported the quantitative but revealed care, tutoring, political positions, pretense to need help as other tactics and victims and society should be blamed;</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Sexual entrapment was found to be common on campus affecting more males than females which could be attributed to the changing times implying that both have their sexual needs but employing different strategies. Age, level of study, knowledge and perception were the major contributing factors influencing sexual entrapment on campus as younger age group, first year students, those of poor knowledge and perception were mostly affected. Child exploitation is also common among study participants. These findings propound evidence to channel interventions to  individual, society, institution such as; educating young people, parents and leaders on sexuality highlighting the causes of sexual entrapment, strategies employed, the perpetrators, resulting consequences and ways of prevention through specifying their roles in the prevention; advocacy i.e. talking  the school authority, community government on behalf of young people and tendering the possible challenges they face within  to enable a safe environment through creation of friendly policies and providing punitive consequences for perpetrators that will prevent occurrence of sexual entrapment; creating website where students can tender complaints and opinions; capacity building i.e. equipping young people with life-building skills that will prevent them from being vulnerable like detecting exploitative motives; creating awareness using Behavioural Change Communication (BCC) materials like bill boards, campus magazines, campus radio station, handbills for  students especially new students on campus.</p>",

      "title": "Understanding the unintended consequences of mHealth: experience of intimate partner violence within an intervention to increase contraceptive use in Bangladesh ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Bangladesh, 85% of married women of reproductive age who are using modern contraception are using a short-term method (the pill, condoms or injectable) and just 4% use a long-acting reversible contraceptive or ‘LARC’ (the IUD or implant). LARCs are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have high user satisfaction. Provision of information on LARCs has been shown to increase uptake. Abortion is restricted in Bangladesh but menstrual regulation (MR) is an approved method for ‘regulating the menstrual cycle when menstruation is absent’, offering women an alternative. Women using MR often want to prevent or delay subsequent pregnancy so are a key group to target with family planning interventions. Mobile phones have potential to support women with contraceptive decision making and use after they have left the clinic, they have successfully improved other health behaviours and outcomes but evidence on their effectiveness for contraception is limited results are mixed. This trial aimed to evaluate an mHealth intervention delivered by mobile phone which was designed to promote contraceptive use among public and private sector MR clients in three Divisions of Bangladesh. Intimate partner violence is associated with family planning use and it is important to monitor this possible adverse outcome.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The primary outcome was self-reported LARC use at four months post-MR; secondary outcomes included use of any effective modern method of contraception (LARC, sterilisation, injectable or pill), and intimate partner violence (IPV). We hypothesised women receiving a health communication promoting contraception delivered to their phone as interactive voice response messages would have a higher level of LARC use at four months post-procedure compared to women who did not receive the intervention. We also conducted a process evaluation which aimed to explore the causal mechanisms behind the trial effects or non-effect.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2015/2016, 972 women were recruited after their MR procedure across 41 sampled facilities and randomised to intervention or control groups. The intervention group were sent 11 automated, interactive voice messages with optional call centre counselling designed to promote contraceptive use over the 4-months post-MR. Participants agreed to receive messages about contraception on their phone and were played an example message during recruitment. For privacy reasons the messages did not mention MR. Participants were interviewed in person at baseline and via phone at two weeks and four months. IPV was measured using a closed question asking about specific acts of violence as well as via a more commonly used open style question asking about any positive or negative effects from study participation. Logistic regression modelling was used to adjust for small baseline differences between the groups. In 2017, in-person, in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 purposively selected trial participants. Themes included how the intervention was used, whether and how it was shared, fertility preferences and how these are negotiated in the family, reasons for use or non-use of contraception, how phones are used and shared in the family and whether any of these have led to conflict or violence.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>485 participants were allocated to the intervention group and 484 to the control group. 773 participants (80%) were interviewed at 4-months. The intervention had no effect on LARC use: 59/383 (15.4%) of control participants and 48/389 (12.3%) of intervention participants reported using a LARC at 4-months p=0.218, OR 0.924 (95%CI: 0.477-1.792) or use of any modern method of contraception p=0.726, OR 1.037 (95%CI: 0.751-1.432). However, women in the intervention group were more likely to report that they experienced physical IPV during the 4-month intervention period than women in the control group 42/386 (10.9%) vs 25/382 (6.5%), p=0.033; odds ratio (adjusted for baseline experience of physical IPV in the past year, age and socio economic status) 1.972 (95%CI: 1.125-3.456). Only four participants gave negative responses to the open question asking whether anything had happened to them as a result of their study participation and none included argument or violence. Preliminary results from the in-depth interviews showed that phone sharing in the family is common and some women also reported their phone use is monitored and controlled by their husband. In some cases participants reported that calls with men and longer calls raise suspicion from their husband or in-laws however none of the 30 participants interviewed reported having a problem resulting from the intervention or from study participation. The majority of participants had told their husbands about the study and some reported that he answered some of the study calls. Many respondents had concealed study participants from their in-laws.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>While some studies have indicated the potential for negative consequences of mHealth on gender relations, to our knowledge this is the first trial to both adequately measure and to demonstrate a negative impact of a sexual reproductive health mHealth intervention on gender-based violence. We have hypothesised a number of causal mechanisms for the violence: 1. It may have been related to the content of the messages (contraception) or the context (post-abortion). For example, the content may have led to disclosure of reproductive behaviours. 2. Conflict may have resulted from changes in the way the phone was used. 3. The intervention may have empowered women to behave differently, in turn challenging existing power dynamics within the couple or household. 4. The intervention could have led to an increase in self-efficacy or trust in the study team enabling intervention participants to report violence. No in-depth interview respondent reported that study participation had led to conflict; it’s possible that those who had faced a problem from study participation may not have agreed to an in-person interview. This trial emphasises the importance of carefully considering how to minimise risk to women when delivering messages on sensitive topics such as contraception or abortion. In contexts where phone sharing is common, non-automated calls may be safer than automated content as the caller can conceal their identity. The findings also demonstrate the need to use specific measures to monitor adverse effects on familial relationships when conducting intervention research.</p>",

      "title": "Applying evidence-based approaches to improve the sustainability of local social marketing organizations",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Social marketing aims to build equitable markets for health products while increasing use among target populations to achieve health impact. It’s widely used to increase adoption of modern family planning (FP) methods (SHOPS Plus 2017). Local social marketing organizations (SMO) often lead these activities, significantly contributing to national FP use. In Nepal, 38% of short-term modern method users rely on Nepal CRS Company brands (Nepal DHS 2016).The Afghan Social Marketing Organization (ASMO) contributes 22% of Afghanistan’s mCPR (AfDHS 2015).</p><p>Most local SMOs are donor dependent and are inadequately prepared for eventual graduation. They often struggle finding balance between social mission and sustainability and require support to build the capacity, resources, and independence needed to remain competitive, support continued contraceptive supplies, and maintain national-level achievements in FP access and use after donors withdraw funds.</p><p>Sustaining Health Outcomes through the Private Sector (SHOPS) Plus is USAID’s flagship initiative in private sector health. SHOPS Plus applies evidence-based, total market approaches (TMA) to support the effective, efficient, and sustainable delivery of quality health products and services across all consumer segments. This includes building local ownership of social marketing programs by providing SMOs with TA to improve their growth and sustainability. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>SHOPS Plus developed a Social Marketing Organization Development Assessment Tool (SMODAT) to objectively assess a local SMO’s strengthens and weaknesses across three key areas of sustainability: technical, institutional, and financial. Once conducted, SHOPS Plus works with SMO leadership to validate findings and prioritize TA that takes the whole market into consideration when designing intervention that improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency and move the SMO toward greater financial sustainability.  SHOPS Plus repeats the assessment and prioritization process annually to monitor progress and adjust priorities as appropriate. SHOPS Plus has implemented the process in Nepal (CRS) and Afghanistan (ASMO).</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>SHOPS Plus developed the SMODAT, an Excel-based tool with objective indicators to measure strength across key areas of organizational sustainability: institutional, technical, financial. Each indicator has a definition, means of verification, and rating scale, with a maximum score of 3.7. SMODAT allows SHOPS Plus to rapidly answer critical questions, including:</p><p>Technical: Does the SMO adequately assure the quality of health products and services? Do they have the capacity to assess the market and effectively apply the four P’s of SM - product, pricing, place, and promotion?</p><p>Institutional:  Does the SMO develop, implement, and monitor policies/strategies for effective corporate communications, organizational governance, human resources management, asset management, and monitoring and evaluation?</p><p>Financial: Does the SMO exhibit strong financial performance by spending within budget, minimizing bad debt, and diversifying funding sources? Do they develop, implement, and monitor effective cost recovery and business development strategies?</p><p>SHOPS Plus facilitates a workshop with SMO leadership and donors to summarize findings, facilitate a SWOT analysis, and prioritize interventions. The workshop culminates in a tailored TA strategy to help the SMO better serve target populations while improving long-term growth and sustainability. SHOPS Plus and the SMO implement the strategy and reassess annually to measure progress, validate priorities, and update the strategy.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Key findings from CRS and ASMO suggest that local SMOs face unique challenges that require tailored solutions. Specifically, findings suggested that local SMOs:</p>\t<li>Lack the financial independence required for sustainability. Many start as projects funded by a single donor (USAID) and evolve into organizations dependent on that donor. They lack the discretionary funds required to invest in business development and diversify their funding streams.</li>\t<li>Face stringent polices around program income (PI) earned with donor funds. They are required to use all PI during and for the program in which it was earned. They are unable to use PI to diversify and generate working capital required to operate without donor funds.</li>\t<li>Lack the platforms afforded to organizations linked with large, international SMOs. This often leads to local SMOs having strong systems for product procurement and quality assurance because they have no fallback. However, it also means they are weaker in technical capacities, like marketing and research, monitoring and evaluation (RME), required to properly target populations with evidence-based interventions.</li><p>Recognizing these common themes, SHOPS Plus tailored TA strategies with CRS and ASMO that focused on two key areas:</p>\t<li>Strengthening financial sustainability through improved organizational processes, including business development, revenue generation strategies, and corporate communications</li>\t<li>Strengthening technical capacity in marketing and RME</li><p>Following one year of interventions, CRS’s SMODAT score increased from 2.3 to 2.84 and ASMO’s increased from 2.12 to 2.7. Both saw greatest improvement in cost recovery, company communications, and RME.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>An ideal, sustainable SMO can identify its specific role in developing the total market, carry out its role effectively and efficiently, and continually adapt as the market evolves – without over-reliance on donor funding. Moving toward the ideal helps grow the total market for products and services while increasing cost recovery of socially marketed products and improving overall organizational sustainability. It supports a TMA by paving the way for commercial actors to service established markets while limiting overlap with government initiatives to reach the poorest populations.</p><p>Supporting SMOs achieve the ideal requires tailored approaches that address unique obstacles and consider the total market for family planning products. In nascent markets, like Afghanistan, there is low mCPR and significant supply- and demand-side gaps. Organizations in these market should prioritize addressing gaps and strengthening the effectiveness of behavior change approaches to strengthen effectiveness and increase FP usage rates. Organizations in more developed markets, like Nepal, should focus on generating and using evidence to improve the effectiveness and efficiencies of product delivery and to better understand and target niche populations to address inequities. They should also explore opportunities to introduce new products and partner with the commercial sector.</p><p>The SMODAT tool allows users to rapidly assess a local SMOs technical, institutional, and financial capacity weaknesses and develop strategies to mitigate them with appropriate interventions taking the total market into consideration. The overall result are stronger organizations with greater capacity, resources, and independence to remain competitive contributors to national health outcomes.</p>",

      "title": "Assessing the Feasibility of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMV) to Provide Injectable Contraceptives",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Drug shops in Nigeria are an important source of contraception, providing more than half of the modern contraceptive services from the private sector (NDHS, 2013). These drug shops are owned by Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs). PPMVs are a source of medicine in many Nigerian communities, especially in those with limited access to essential health commodities. Several studies have shown PPMVs are often the first point of care, especially in rural and low-income communities, due to their flexibility, geographical accessibility and pricing, among other reasons (Beyeler, 2015). Despite their popularity, the law in Nigeria restricts PPMVs from selling and administering injectable contraceptives.</p><p>The modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) is very low in Nigeria at 10.8%. The mCPR is even lower in rural Nigeria – 7.7% - as opposed to 17.9% in the urban area (MICS 2017). This can be attributed to several factors including unavailability of skilled providers. With Nigeria’s commitment to increase the mCPR to 27% by 2020, more innovative approaches to expanding access, including leveraging existing opportunities like PPMVs, is necessary now more than ever.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Although several studies have explored the role of PPMVs in the provision of contraceptive services, few have specifically assessed PPMV’s ability to provide counseling for and administer injectable contraceptives. This analysis looks at whether trained PPMVs can competently administer and counsel clients on injectable contraceptives. Results will provide policy makers in Nigeria, and in similar settings, the response to whether drugs shops are a feasible source for injectable contraceptive services</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data were collected from with 225 PPMVs and 294 PPMV injectable clients in four states (Bauchi, Cross-River, Ebonyi and Kaduna) in Nigeria. PPMVs received a five-day training on family planning (FP) counselling, administration of Depo-Provera, Noristerat and Sayana® Press, and disposal of sharps. An observation checklist was used to assess administration skills using models immediately after the training, and six months post training. Client data were collected within five days after receiving an injectable contraceptive from a trained PPMV and at three months. </p><p>The analysis included two outcome variables: competency in administering injectable contraceptives and counseling received by clients.  A composite score for competency in administration was computed using results from the observation checklist while counselling was computed using responses from the client exit and three-month follow-up interviews.</p><p>There were ten steps for Depo-Provera and Sayana Press respectively and seven counselling messages evaluated. All variables scored “1” except key steps for Depo-Provera (expel air, aspirate needle), for Sayana Press (activate, pinch skin), and key counselling messages (information on side effect and return date) that were valued as “2”. Scores ranged from 0-12 for administration (high competence = 9 or higher) and 0-9 for counselling (good counseling = 7 or higher).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 232 PPMVs were trained but seven got excluded from the study – four for inability to demonstrate competency at post-test and three for missing some training sessions. All PPMVs were literate and more than half (58.2%) had post-secondary education. About 55.4% of injectable contraceptive clients were between the ages of 25 and 34, 64.6% had at least a secondary education.</p><p>Prior training, 96.9% sold at least one modern contraceptive method. When asked the type of injectable services provided, 69.3% of the PPMVs referred clients, 58.7% sold injectable contraceptives, and 41.3% administered in their shop. Because less than half reported administering any injectable and only 10% had heard of Sayana Press, observation data were not collected at baseline.</p><p>After the training, PPMVs demonstrated competence in administering both intramuscular and subcutaneous forms of the injectable contraceptives on models. A majority (85.3%), demonstrated high competence in the administration of Depo-Provera and a slightly higher percentage (88.0%) in administering Sayana Press. Six months after the training, 164 PPMVs were observed and more than two-thirds (71.3%) demonstrated high competence in administering Depo-Provera and 80.5% in administering Sayana Press.</p><p>To assess counseling provided by PPMV after the training, clients were asked a series of questions about the FP consultation received. At the exit interview, 88.4% of clients reported their PPMVs provided “good” counseling during their most recent visit. Furthermore, three months after their initial visit to a trained PPMV (4 – 7 months post-training), 80.0% of clients reported their PPMV provided “good” counseling.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Several studies have called for evidence on whether PPMVs can safely provide injectable contraceptive services (Ajuwon, 2016). The preliminary results suggest that PPMV can competently demonstrate the administration steps with proper training. This adds to the wealth of evidence showing PPMVs can effectively provide a range of injectable contraceptive services, including administration.</p><p>Women irrespective of their level of education and age receive services from PPMVs. A high proportion of clients reported they received good or sufficient counseling when seeking injectable contraceptives, which suggests that PPMVs can counsel clients even four to seven months after their training.</p><p>The results suggest that PPMVs can be trained to provide counseling and administer injectable contraceptives to standard. If formally integrated into the health system, PPMVs could increase access to contraceptive services, especially to clients living in rural and semi-urban areas.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>More than 70% of health care services are received by communities in India from private sector agnostic of wealth quintile and social economic status. But when it comes to family planning, the contribution of private sector is negligible. Government policies and procedures are required in India to get accredited to provide higher order family planning services and the profit earned from FP services does not attract private sector providers. Government frontline workers are not allowed to refer clients to private sector and private sector does not invest in community mobilization due to less profit and risks involve. Considering FP2020 in mind, it’s essential to open the market for communities to choose a method of their choice at facility of their choice as well. </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Advocacy with government to make a policy change to allow urban accredited social health activists (ASHA) for referring clients to facility of their choice including private facilities. With government orders, the intervention is initiated in 5 cities of Uttar Pradesh. Intervention includes ASHA training, private facility accreditation, comprehensive community mobilization plan for total existing market and quality assurance support.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In five cities of Uttar Pradesh in India, the urban ASHA model for private sector was initiated. Accredited private facilities were identified in these selected cities and an interface meeting with city government official was conducted to remove initial bottlenecks and confusions. Quality assurance committees were activated in these cities to improve and certify quality at facilities. ASHA were trained on informed choice counselling and process of getting engaged with private sector. Online existing web-portal was used to record and analyse data for further planning and scaling up. Intervention has completed three months and urban slum was targeted for community mobilization and communication plan. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>94 private accredited facilities got enrolled in this program and initiated family planning services for urban poor. 130 ASHAs received training from the program on process flow, informed choice and counselling skills. Out of 94, 32 facilities started fixed day static service and more than 1000 women received the method of their choice from these accredited facilities. ASHAs got opportunity of working with private sector and communities got access to quality family planning services. Defunct private facilities get activated and started providing FP services. First time in India government started playing a role of market manager and not only a market player. First time in Uttar Pradesh the government has invested for government led community mobilization for private sector. </p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Government led community mobilization for private sector increases the access of poor urban communities to quality family planning services. It also helps government to reduce over workload on government primary and secondary service delivery point. Moreover it opens the entire market and put family planning in priority of private sector too. It has great scalability potential and many of the states in India is looking for support to initiate such interventions. Private sector can contribute significantly to achieve FP 2020 goals. The approach helps to increase the facility base by many folds as private facilities are numerous in numbers.    Government led community mobilization for private sector increases the access of poor urban communities to quality family planning services.

      "significanceBackground": "<p><strong>1. Significance/background</strong></p><p>In Ethiopia, an estimated 24% of women had an unmet need for modern contraception in 2017[i], and it is higher among rural young wormen.  There has been a large increase in the number of private health facilities in Ethiopia, but only a small proportion provide reproductive health services.  Social franchising (whereby private sector health providers deliver quality-assured health services under a common franchise brand) has been shown to engage private providers with public health goals[ii] – including increasing access to FP.</p><p>Since 1966, Family Health Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE – a member association of IPPF) has operated primarily through a network of static and mobile clinics.  To expand access to quality FP services for underserved communities, FGAE established a network of socially franchised clinics in 2013 called Family Health Network (FHN).  The network has grown substantially since 2013, and in 2016, nearly 1.5million voluntary FP services were provided by FHN franchisees. </p><p>To make the best use of limited resources of FGAE, like other service delivery organisations, needs to consider how cost-effective social franchising is as a service delivery model.  FGAE have, therefore conducted a cost-effectiveness evaluation of the FHN network as compared to the static clinics.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p><strong>2. Program intervention/activity tested</strong> </p><p>FHN franchisees offer services including voluntary FP, STIs care, comprehensive safe abortion care, and HIV counselling and testing. In exchange for a small annual franchise fee paid by franchisees, FGAE trains franchisee service providers; provide contraceptive commodities and equipment for infection prevention; conducts regular quality assurance; and allows franchisees to operate under the FHN brand.  Affordable service prices are set across the network. In 2017, 326 primary and medium FNH clinics were operating in rural and semi-urban areas. The program is mainly focusing in ensuring access to FP particularly for low-income populations by providing quality and</p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>3. Methodology</strong></p><p>A study was conducted to identify lessons from the implementation of the FGAE social franchise model and to compare the cost effectiveness of service provision through FHN clinics versus delivery through static and mobile clinics. The methodology used was both a retrospective longitudinal study and a quasi-experimental study with quantitative and qualitative components.</p><p>The qualitative component included a desk review of program documents, and key informant interviews with FGAE and franchisee staff. Information was collected on franchisee selection and management, incentive systems, quality and incident management, sustainability, organizational structure, and data management.</p><p>To calculate the comparative cost-effectiveness of service delivery through franchisees vs FGAE static, a step-wise retrospective analysis of cost and of SRH service delivery data was conducted.  Cost data was extracted from FGAE’s financial accounts to identify costs borne by FGAE in operating it's own clinics, and managing the FHN between 2014 and 2017.  Service statistics were extracted for the same three-year period and entered into the PSI Impact Calculator[i] to calculate the number of CYPs provided and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. This enabled us to calculate the cost to FGAE per DALY averted and per CYP provided in FHN sites, and in FGAE’s own clinics.</p><p></p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>4. Results/key findings*</strong></p><p>FGAE started with 40 social franchisee clinics in 2013 and through a phased approach, the network had grown to 326 clinics in 2017. The number of voluntary FP services provided by the FHN clinics increased from 231,358 in 2014 to 1,484,397 in 2016.FNH clinics contributed about 50% of all FP services and 30% of all CYPs generated by FGAE in 2016. The evaluation identified several factors which enabled this growth, including (1) the use of a devolved management structure whereby franchisees are clustered and managed by ‘model’ FGAE clinics with minimal oversight from FGAE headquarters (2) efforts to ensure a balance between national regulatory frameworks and the FHN operation manual (3) success in clearly defining franchisee and franchisor obligations and quality standards, which enabled FGAE to de-franchise non-compliant clinics and expand the network whilst maintaining a clear focus on quality.</p><p>The cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that delivering SRH services via the FHN (SF model) is more cost-effective to FGAE compared to delivering the same services via the static clinics. Between 2014 and 2016, the average cost to FGAE per DALY-averted for FHN clinics ranged from USD 1.38-3.30, compared with a range of USD 37.38-51.79 per DALY-averted for FGAE clinics. In the same period, the cost to FGAE per CYP-provided was estimated to be between USD 0.73-1.77 for FHN clinics, and between USD 25.61-37.35 for FGAE clinics.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p><strong> 5. Program implications/lessons </strong></p><p>FGAE has made great progress in establishing and growing a thriving social franchising program that continues to expand access to voluntary FP services for underserved, low-income people. The FGAE experience can serve to provide lessons to other service delivery organisations which are either establishing or managing a franchise program.</p><p>The costings analysis demonstrates that, for service delivery organisations, social franchising can offer a cost-effective model for expanding reach to underserved populations. This evaluation showed that it is more cost-effective for FGAE to deliver SRH services via the social franchise model compared to the FGAE-owned (static) clinics. The cost difference can be explained by the fact that the majority of the financial burden associated with establishing and managing services is passed down to individual private providers in exchange for training, supervision and ‘membership’ of a reputable network, increasing footfall and income. For FGAE and other organisations, this finding will be of value in making strategic decisions about the comparative investment of funds to expand services to the underserved Population.   </p><p>To keep the program more cost-effective and sustainable, FGAE, and other service delivery organisation must keep overhead costs as low as possible while ensuring that support for the SF program is not compromised. This has been enabled partly through the decentralizing of franchisee management from headquarters to regional level. Other service delivery organisations are encouraged to consider this management model.</p>",

      "title": "Assessing Provision of the Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System in Nigeria",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is one of the most effective forms of contraception available and has important non-contraceptive health benefits due to its effects on menstrual bleeding.  Use of LNG-IUS has increased rapidly in high-income countries over the past decade, but access to and use of the method in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been restricted by its high price.</p><p>16% of married women in Nigeria currently use a modern contraceptive method, while 25% of married women have an unmet need for family planning (FP), the majority for spacing (PMA 2017). Despite recent efforts to increase availability and uptake of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), the copper intrauterine device (IUD) comprises a small portion (7%) of Nigeria’s contraceptive method mix, and growth in IUD use has remained low while implant use has increased rapidly in recent years. Introducing additional contraceptive technologies into a country’s national method mix can help address unmet need for FP by offering methods with different benefits or side-effect profiles.</p><p>In 2016 Marie Stopes International Nigeria (MSION) began piloting introduction of an affordable LNG-IUS product, donated for free by the International Contraceptive Access (ICA) Foundation, a public-private partnership between Bayer Healthcare and the Population Council.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Between September 2016 and December 2017, MSION offered the LNG-IUS alongside other FP methods through private socially franchised providers, mobile outreach teams and public sector facilities supported by MSION. This intervention included training 148 providers and 12 MSION supervisors on LNG-IUS provision, awareness raising among potential users, and monitoring of service provision. MSI partnered with FHI 360 to document experiences with provision and use of the LNG-IUS in these settings, and to assess the potential for further scale-up of the method more broadly.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This was a mixed method study conducted between September 2016 and December 2017 in 18 states across Nigeria.</p><p>We used routine MSION service data from participating facilities/ teams, including the number of services delivered, age of client, and previous FP use. During the intervention, providers collected ‘augmented routine data’ from LNG-IUS clients, including reasons for choosing the LNG-IUS, how they heard about the method, and what method they would have chosen if the LNG-IUS had not been available that day.</p><p></p><p>In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with 33 LNG-IUS users and 32 LNG-IUS providers between March and October 2017. Women and providers were selected through convenience sampling. The interviews focused on women’s experiences with the LNG-IUS, especially around potential contraceptive and non-contraceptive benefits of the method, and providers’ experiences with provision of the LNG-IUS, attitudes toward the method, and implications for expanding access to the method.</p><p></p><p>Finally, interviews were conducted with 17 Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) to document perceptions regarding opportunities and challenges associated with further introduction and scale-up of the method more broadly within Nigeria. KOLs were identified by local FHI 360 and MSION staff and included representatives from government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academic instituations, donor groups, and procurement organizations.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Seventy-six private providers, nine outreach teams, and 30 public sector facilities delivered 1052 LNG-IUS between September 2016 and December 2017. The majority (92%) were delivered in private social franchise clinics or on outreach, and five private providers and four outreach teams delivered half (49%) of all LNG-IUS services. LNG-IUS made up less than 1% of all LARCs provided by the participating providers during the intervention. Services were free on outreach and at public facilities, while private providers charged up to US$10.</p><p>The mean age for LNG-IUS clients was 34 years and they had on average 4.4 children. 70% of LNG-IUS clients had secondary education or higher.</p><p>The most commonly mentioned reason for choosing LNG-IUS by women was reduced menstrual bleeding (64%), mentioned by 93% of outreach and 53% of private clients. If LNG-IUS had not been available, 79% of women would have chosen another LARC. Most clients heard about the LNG-IUS from clinic staff (70%).</p><p>According to IDIs with LNG-IUS users, most women reported positive experiences with using the method and all said they intended to continue it. LNG-IUS users, providers and KOLs mentioned reduced menstrual bleeding as a key advantage of the LNG-IUS, though some users stated that they would be unhappy if bleeding stopped entirely.</p><p>Barriers to wider use of the method reported by KOLs included high commodity costs, a shortage of trained providers, and the invasiveness of the insertion procedure. Most KOLs felt that demand for the method would increase if new, more affordable products were introduced.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>LNG-IUS users, providers and KOLs expressed enthusiasm for the product, including the method’s non-contraceptive benefits. However, uptake was low, perhaps due to the short time frame of the intervention, and the challenges of introducing a new method through a service delivery infrastructure already at full capacity and focused on expanding access to existing available methods. No LNG-IUS specific awareness raising activities were undertaken, partly due to staff concerns about appearing to ‘promote’ one method over another.</p><p>Whilst KOLs and providers felt that cost of existing LNG-IUS products was a barrier to uptake, the MSION intervention did not see a notable difference in LNG-IUS demand even when price was varied, or services were free.</p><p>A small pool of providers were responsible for delivering almost half of all LNG-IUS delivered during the intervention.  More research is needed to understand the demand, supply and environment factors behind this but it suggests that lessons can be learned from these successful providers to inform a more effective launch in future. The important role played by the provider in LNG-IUS uptake is also indicated by qualitative findings that women’s main reason for choosing the LNG-IUS was provider recommendation, and by the high proportion of clients (70%) who heard about the LNG-IUS from the provider.</p><p>MSION’s experience suggests that a holistic, intensive and multi-stakeholder approach with coordinated demand and supply-side elements may be required in order for the benefits of LNG-IUS access to be fully realized in Nigeria and other similar contexts.</p>",

      "title": "Knowledge and Factors Influencing Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive Use Among Women of Reproductive Age in Nigeria.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) including intra-uterine device and implant contraceptives is highly effective and has the additional advantages of being long-lasting, convenient, require little or no maintenance. Once inserted, long-acting devices provide at least three years of continuous pregnancy protection and are more than 99% effective because they are not subject to errors in use that may reduce the effectiveness of short-acting methods. Approximately 48% of unintended pregnancies occur in the month when contraception is used. Poor adherence, incorrect use, and/or technology failures are to blame. This can be avoided with the use of LARC methods because they are not dependent on compliance with a pill-taking regimen, remembering to change a patch or ring.</p><p>Nigeria has one of the highest total fertility rates (5.5) globally and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Her high fertility is mainly attributed to low use of contraception (17.1%) and this also reflected in the number of women that subscribed to LARC despite being the most cost-effective contraceptives. In Nigeria, knowledge about LARC shows that 36.8% of women have knowledge of IUD and 49.5% implant.</p><p></p><p>Despite the level of awareness about the efficacy and safety of LARC, the use is not widespread. Hence, this study.</p><p></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The question of interest is to know the relationship between knowledge of LARC and its current use. Hence, this paper sought to examine the relationship between knowledge of LARC, characteristics of the women and the current use of LARC among women of reproductive age in Nigeria.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study employed secondary data which was extracted from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) 2016 dataset. PMA 2016 was a survey carried out in 7 states of Nigeria, Anambra, Kaduna, Kano, Lagos Nasarawa, Rivers and Taraba States between May and June, 2016. The survey used aboriginal enumerators who were familiar with the enumeration areas and also had a good command of the local language. A multistage sampling technique was employed, first to select EAs in each LG of the state, and also to randomly select households for an interview in each selected EAs. All females of reproductive age (15-49 years) living within the selected household were administered a female questionnaire by the enumerators. Information recorded on the questionnaires included the eligible female’s background information, birth history, fertility preference, use of family planning methods and their reproductive health information among others. A total of 11, 177 female were interviewed. The target population for this study was women who are currently using any method of contraception prior to the survey. Women who met the inclusion criteria was 1927. The data was analyzed adopting univariate (frequency distribution), bivariate (chi-square test) and logistic regression measures.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results shows that 76.6% were currently married, 52.6% had 1-4 children at the first use of contraceptive, 76.5% female that are currently using any method of contraceptive were using modern contraceptive and respondent using LARC were only 14.8%. The study revealed that LARC use increases as the respondent’s reproductive age increases. More female who resides in urban areas were using LARC compared to those in rural areas. More female with secondary education subscribed to LARC methods compared to female with no education, primary and higher education. Marital status shows that married women prefer LARC compared to divorced/separated, widow and never married. With respect to household wealth index, the table shows that more women from poor household subscribed to LARC method compared to women from middle and rich household.   Lastly, number of children at the time respondent started using contraceptive shows that more women that had 1-4 children subscribed to LARC methods compare to women with no child and women with more than four (4) children.</p><p>The bivariate result revealed that there is a significant relationship (p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>LARCs were largely under used among women that are currently using any method of contraceptives. Low use of highly effective LARC is an important failure to meet women's reproductive needs in a context where women are redefining their reproductive life style by delaying and spacing childbearing to adapt to socioeconomic opportunities. Therefore, women with lower educational level, poor wealth index, and higher number of living children should be targeted by programme strategies to control childbearing. Also, there is need for a communication strategy that would provide correct information about LARC safety and effectiveness among women of reproductive age. Lastly, when discussing contraception with women, health care practitioners should discuss the risks and benefits of LARCs with women of all ages and recommend them as a first line method.</p><p></p>",

      "title": "Predicting the future needs of contraceptive users",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The development of truly new and innovative contraceptive technologies is a process with an extended time horizon. Given the timeline of produce development, innovative products not already under development would likely not be available at scale until at least 2040. Therefore, identifying potential investments and considering product features requires an understanding the world of 2040 into which a transformative contraceptive technology would be introduced. Projecting the future needs and preferences of women can help ensure that the new technologies that are developed have attributes that are relevant to what those women are most interested to have. A novel technology would also need a market beyond the developing world in order to be commercially viable, so any modeling should take into account potential markets of women in both developed and developing countries, with consideration both for a method that non-users may adopt, as well as a method that current users may switch to if it offers preferable attributes.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What contraceptive attributes will align most closely with the demography, lifestyles, fertility intentions and use patterns of women in 2040?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The modelling required multiple phases: 1) analytical segmentation of the global population of women of reproductive age (WRA) in 2017 and 2040 based on marital status, fertility preferences, and sexual activity among unmarried women; 2) scoring of potential attribute interest for each of the segments; 3) estimating the numbers of women interested in particular method attributes; 4) translating attribute interest into method uptake; and 5) quantifying impact in ‘unintended pregnancies averted.’</p><p>The first phase utilized existing projections of WRA, fertility rates, contraceptive prevalence, and marriage rates from the UNPD. Additionally, survey data, regression models, and expert option were used to develop segments in 2017 and build a deterministic model to project changes to 2040.   </p><p>A matrix was developed to score each attribute’s potential interest among users and non-users within each segment. Examples of attribute groups include duration, invasiveness, and reversibility. The matrix was applied to the segments layered with a range of uptake rates to estimate potential numbers of adopters and switchers. </p><p>Finally, unintended pregnancies averted were calculated based on specified effectiveness levels of the new method compared to a counterfactual. This allowed for comparability of impact among both adopters of and switchers to a method with the specified attribute.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Both in 2017 and 2040 the single largest segment globally is married women who want no more children; this group is projected to reach nearly 900 million by 2040. Around half of these women are projected to be using a short-term method, traditional method, or no method. The segment showing the largest absolute growth from 2017 to 2040 was never married women who have had sex (but not recently); increasing from 79 million to nearly 175 million. Regional differences can be seen in these changes and the distributions of women across the segments.</p><p>Results show that by 2040 there is still expected to be a large burden of unintended pregnancies globally; with more than 118 million unintended pregnancies experienced. The majority (62%) will be experienced by non-users.  This result highlights the potential role of a new contraceptive technology for users who could switch to a more effective method and non-users who could adopt a method.</p><p>Initial modelling quantified the potential impact of a new method with the following attributes (independently): very long duration, side effects not associated with a hormonal method, and a non-invasive method. Large potential for switching was found among women wanting no more children (particularly in South Asia). Results show potential adopters are largely concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to lower levels of contraceptive use, and South Asia, due to large population size.     </p><p>Disaggregated results show how the attractiveness of attributes vary by region and segment (e.g., unmarried sexually active women vs. married spaces). </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Demographic and secular trends will lead to a contraceptive market that is significantly different than what we observe today. Africa will see the most change, both in terms of increases in number of WRA and changes in the distribution of women across segments. In Asia, many segments will see large decreases given projected declines in fertility rates; however, despite these declines, this region will still be home the largest numbers of potential users.</p><p>Despite projected gains in contraceptive use over the coming decades, women in 2040 will still face a large burden of unintended pregnancy, both from women not using a method when pregnancy is unwanted and from women using methods with a higher failure rate. The introduction of a new contraceptive technology has the potential to address this burden, if the method is accessible and holds attributes that women will find appealing. This modelling work has helped to quantify what these attributes might be and what type of impact a new contraceptive technology could have in both developed and developing country markets.    </p><p>This work links the changing distributions of women with method attributes that will make contraceptive choices better for the women of 2040. This can guide the blue sky envisioning and early stage development of transformational contraceptive technologies.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Kenya’s private sector plays a key role in expanding family planning (FP) access and use. Pharmacies and retail outlets largely sell subsidised socially marketed FP products (typically condoms, pills and injectables) compared to non-subsidised FP products from the for-profit or commercial sector.</p><p>As a result, subsidised socially marketed products have dominated the private market for many years, despite Kenya’s growing middle and upper socio-economic classes that can afford to pay for non-subsidised products. </p><p>This has resulted in social marketing products which are subsidised by donors being used by those that do not need a subsidy.  Unregulated subsidies have distorted the market.  Enormous donor funds and subsidies have also crowded out the commercial sector products, even though evidence shows that increasing numbers of Kenyans are willing to pay more for high-quality products.  For many years, the dominance of social marketing also reduced the choices available to consumers as typically there has only been one brand of condom, pill and injectable available. </p><p>The ESHE’s programme has successfully supported the introduction of five new, non-subsidised products into Kenya’s private market using a Making Markets Work for the Poor (M4P) approach. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The UKAid supported ESHE programme is the largest single FP programme in Kenya. Since 2013, the ESHE programme has expanded access to FP in 41 out of 47 counties, including the most marginalised.</p><p>With a major focus on expanding FP access in the private sector through a Total Market Approach (TMA), ESHE introduced four new FP products into the market through facilitating and supporting the commercial sector.  Products were not subsidised with donor funds.  Products introduced include: a third generation combined oral contraceptive; a progestin-only pill; a WHO-pre-qualified one pill EC, and DMPA-SC also known as Sayana Press injectable.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The location for the abstract is Kenya, including the main urban cities and towns including Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Nakuru and several large counties.   The abstract covers programming work from 2015 – 2018. </p><p>The programme studies and analyses that informed the programming included:</p>\t<li><strong>Market segmentation analysis </strong>was carried out to demonstrate how the different FP segments across the wealth quintiles in rural and urban populations use services and products between the public and private sectors.</li><p>Market segmentation was carried out in early 2016 through a secondary analysis of the raw data from Kenya’s 2014 Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS).  The analysis was carried out between Palladium staff in Nairobi, Kenya, and Washington D.C.  <em>SPSS Statistics</em> was used to carry out the quantitative analysis.</p>\t<li><strong>FP market gap analysis</strong> included a secondary analysis of available sales and distribution data by brand and product type to inform which products were not available in the private market</li>\t<li><strong>FP market diagnostic study </strong>was carried out through key informant interviews with more than 20 key stakeholder, secondary analysis of published FP literature and followed an M4P methodology</li>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Studies highlighted the reasons why commercial players were incentivsed or disincentivised to enter in Kenya FP market.  Studies also indicated the extent to which subsidised services and products reached those that can afford to pay.  Market analysis indicated which products were not available to consumers in the private market.</p><p>From April 2015 and December 2017, four new and additional FP products were introduced into the Kenyan market.  These products include Julee (a combined oral contraceptive), Hyan (a high-quality but affordable progestin only pill for breastfeeding mothers), Revoke (a World Health Organisation (WHO) prequalified, one-tablet emergency contraceptive), IUCD which were not available in the private market previously; created a market for and helped to introduce Sayana Press (injectable contraceptive) into Kenya for the first time ever.</p><p>In total, 394,353 additional products being brought into the market.   Sales of the first two products, Julee COC and Hyan POP, sold slower than expected and this was largely due to the retail price being too high.  Sales improved with lower prices.  Revoke EC sold quickly and competed well in an already very busy EC market.  More than two years of negotiations with Pfizer resulted in 30,000 cycles being brought into the market.  Sales of the product were slower than expected, primarily because of lack of support and endorsement for the product from the national MoH.  Sales of IUCDs are good and more data and findings will be ready by the time of ICFP.  </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The role of the commercial sector in expanding FP access is growing and significant despite the market challenges with leakages of the subsidised commodities into the private market.   However, the commercial sector are often overlooked in favour of NGOs and social marketing which provide subsidised products.</p><p>The commercial sector can be incentive to join an FP market without significant funds or support.  Smart incentives and good market analysis, with small but catalytic support, can be enough of an incentive to support market entry. </p><p>However, to compete in highly subsidised markets, the commercial sector may need greater support for marketing to be able to survive against large-scale marketing budgets of donor funded social marketing programmes.  Coordination of donor programmes under a Total Market Approach is important in this regard, and also to counter the excessive leakage of free products into the private sector while reduces the ability of the commercial sector products to survive. </p><p>While the programme intended to fill gaps in the market by introducing new FP products, instead of competing with other brands and products, it is challenging to fill gaps if products are not in high demand. </p><p>Starting small, piloting, learning before scaling-up. It is important to introduce smaller trial batches of new products to test the market, to determine its appetite and determine whether it can thrive before full scale-up. This approach avoids wastage in the form of expiry of products and spending a lot of money promoting a product that will not work in a particular market.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>While popular throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, injectable contraception is notable for high rates of discontinuation. Women using intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM) must return to the clinic every three months for reinjection and challenges with adherence to the reinjection schedule may impede continuous, uninterrupted injectable use. Discontinuation is a significant cause of unmet need, with a recent analysis suggesting that one-third of unintended births may be attributable to discontinuation. Thus, methods or delivery modalities that facilitate method continuation are an essential part of reducing unmet need.</p><p>A new formulation and presentation of DMPA administered subcutaneously (DMPA-SC), is now approved and available in at least 25 countries worldwide (Sayana® Press, Pfizer Inc.). This product, which is packaged in an all-in-one injection system and designed to be easy to use, can be administered by women themselves through self-injection. A number of studies have demonstrated that self-administration of injectable contraception is feasible and acceptable, including studies in Senegal, Uganda, and Malawi. While women in these countries consider self-injection to be an attractive option, the question remains of whether offering self-injection may improve outcomes for family planning programs and, specifically, facilitate uninterrupted use of injectable contraception.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study compares 12-month continuation rates for women who self-inject DMPA-SC and women receiving DMPA-IM from a provider. It addresses the question of whether self-injection may improve injectable continuation by reducing the burden of time and travel for women who must otherwise return to clinics for quarterly reinjection visits. Results will inform Ministry of Health conversations surrounding the future scale-up of self-injection in Senegal.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Women seeking injectable contraception at 13 health facilities in 8 districts were offered the choice of self-injecting DMPA-SC or receiving DMPA-IM from a health worker. Those opting for self-injection were trained by a study nurse, self-injected under supervision, and if competent at self-injection, were given three DMPA-SC units, a client instruction guide, and a reinjection calendar to take home. Women who did not demonstrate competent technique returned for re-training when due for their next injection. Those opting for DMPA-IM were administered their injection and given an appointment card for their next clinic visit in three months. Participants were interviewed at baseline (first injection) and after three (second injection), six (third injection), and nine (fourth injection) months, or upon discontinuation. Women who did not self-inject or return to the clinic for reinjection within four weeks of their reinjection date (within 120 days of their previous injection) were considered to have discontinued. Differences in the characteristics of the two groups were measured using ttests and chi-square statistics, using a two-sided test with alpha .05. Kaplan-Meier methods were employed to estimate continuation probabilities, with a log-rank test to compare differences between the two groups. The multivariate analysis was performed using Cox regression analysis.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 1,298 women were enrolled in the study—649 in the self-injection group and 649 in the DMPA-IM group. The 12-month continuation rate for women self-injecting DMPA-SC was .80.2 (95% CI .77–.83) and the rate for women receiving DMPA-IM from a health worker was .70.4 (95% CI .66–.74). There was a single suspected pregnancy that occurred in the DMPA-IM group. Significantly fewer women who self-injected reported experiencing side effects after each injection during the follow-up interviews. Self-injectors had significantly more education and household assets, were more likely to have paid to travel to the clinic, and were more likely to have used DMPA-SC (administered by a provider) in the past. Women in the DMPA-IM group had significantly higher parity and a higher percentage reported feeling injection anxiety. Controlling for differences between the two groups, a Cox multivariate regression analysis revealed that women who were self-injecting had a significantly lower hazard for discontinuation.</p><p>In both groups, the most common reason given for discontinuing was being late or forgetting the injection date (45 percent of discontinuers in both groups). Among self-injectors, other common reasons for discontinuing included husband disapproval (24 percent) and the desire to have a child (21 percent), and among DMPA-IM users, desire for a child (18 percent) and side effects (14 percent).</p>",

The significantly higher 12-month continuation for women self-injecting DMPA-SC compared with women given DMPA-IM—which remained significant in a multivariate analysis—suggests this delivery modality may improve injectable continuation, and do so without increasing the risk of pregnancy or adverse events. These results, the first of their kind from a Francophone West African country, align with recent studies from Malawi, Uganda, and the United States that found similarly elevated one-year continuation rates for self-injectors relative to those receiving DMPA injections from health workers. Collectively, these studies suggest that women from very different contexts can benefit from this delivery strategy.</p><p>This is also the first study to show a significant difference in side effects between women using DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM. Side effects are a major contributor to contraceptive discontinuation among women using injectable contraception; while previous studies have not found significantly reduced side effects for the lower-dose DMPA-SC, providers in both Uganda and Senegal anecdotally report that their clients have fewer side effects complaints. While this study was not designed to measure side effects, these results raise the possibility of a small difference in side effects between these two products that merits further investigation. </p><p>Results from this study and an associated cost-effectiveness analysis will inform discussions with the Ministry of Health and implementation partners as they move forward with plans to scale-up the practice of self-injection in Senegal.</p>",

      "title": "Sociodemographic Characteristics, Contraceptive Choice and FP Method Switch Pattern of Women in a DMPA-SC Community-Based Project in Nigeria",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Nigeria’s ambitious goal of increasing its contraceptive prevalence to 36% by 2030 is daunting yet achievable through culturally sensitive innovative programs and improved access to quality contraceptive services. This informed the support provided by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to the Association for Reproductive and Family Health (ARFH) and other partners to introduce the next generation method, Subcutaneous Depo Medroxyl Acetate (DMPA-SC) in Nigeria. Following the initial pilot in 2 Nigerian states and the overwhelming acceptance by women, the project ‘Sayana Press Scale Up project’ provided access to over 55,914 women in four states in Nigeria. The project trained and equipped community health extension workers (CHEWS) and non-health community-based distributors/resource persons (to administer a cocktail of non-prescriptive methods). The non-heath community based distributors (CBDs) were linked with community health extension workers (CHEWs) who through their community/facility functions supported them in administering the DMPA-SC. The study highlights the sociodemographic variables, contraceptive choice of women and their relative preference for the different community-based approaches used to introduce this method.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study is a descriptive retrospective examination of women’s sociodemographic variables, choice of FP and relative preference for the next generation DMPA-SC using a community-based program approach. The study seeks to answer the following questions: 1) What are the sociodemographic characteristics of women who access FP services in a community-based FP project? 2) What are the women’s FP method choices? 3) Does the type of community-based approach affect commodity uptake? 4) What are the service-related pattern of modern FP methods uptake on the project?  5) What population of women switched from any modern method to DMPA-SC on the project.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study is a retrospective secondary data analysis using the seven-month records of clients who accessed FP services from trained providers on a community-based project to introduce DMPA-SC in 4 Nigerian states (Sokoto, Kebbi, Ebonyi and Gombe states), between November 2016 to June 2017. Data from primary data sheet (PDS) containing information of 55,914 women entered in the UNFPA Magpi platform was enumerated. Data was collected using a standardized tool: the PDS. The tool was administered by community-based service providers trained by the ARFH in forty-four implementation local government areas across four states in Nigeria. The tool included both clients’ and providers’ demographics, contraceptive choice and category of location. Data entry clerks then extracted the information and entered them into the Magpi platform. The Magpi platform is a cloud-based mobile collection, communication, and data visualization tool that allows survey information to be entered into a mobile or computer-based platform, improving the effectiveness of mobile workforce and field operations. It allows data to be visualized real-time, suggestions made, errors flagged and cleaned up, so as to have a reliable data. Data was exported first to an excel format and then SPSS 23.0. The SPSS 23.0 was used to produce frequency distribution,</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Majority (84.7%) of clients that accessed services were females, and most (74.0%) were 25 years and above. While some (17.7%) were within the age range of 20 to 24 years, the others (4.2%) were less than 20 years. The clients were distributed across four states: Ebonyi (22.2%), Gombe (28.0%), Kebbi (37.4%), and Sokoto (12.4%) states. Following a balanced counselling, most (74.1%) of the clients opted for DMPA-SC among the cocktail of available non-prescriptive FP methods provided by the community-based agents. Most (82.9%) of the clients were new acceptors of a FP method, while 9.2% were returning revisit cases for all forms of contraception. Most (86.5%) of the new acceptors of an FP method were females. The client’s FP method choice ranged from DMPA-SC (90.1%), male condoms (20.9%), female condoms (5.0%), Pills (3.1%), DMPA-IM (0.9%), and LARC (.002%). A significant percentage (23.5%) of females received male condoms for their partners, compared to 11.6% of their male counterparts who received female condoms from providers. Large percentages (39.9%) of the women showed preference for CHEWs, compared to 18.1%, 26.1%, and 15.9% of the women who were more comfortable receiving services from household-to-household volunteers (mostly unemployed CHEWs), trained market-based agents (who were paired with facility-based CHEWs), or CBDs with no health background. The study found that only a small percentage (5.1%) of the women decided to switch from another form of modern contraception to DMPA-SC.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The findings highlights the existence of a large pool of women who are FP method-naive and the relative contribution that introducing DMPA-SC will make to increasing women’s access to FP in Nigeria. The study shows the relative preference of women for each of the different community-based approaches/structures that ARFH used in delivering services on this project. It equally underscores the relative appeal and choice of women for DMPA-SC, when using community-based approaches, compared to other contraceptive methods. Although the switch pattern observed from other modern methods to DMPA-SC in this study may not be generalizable, it should guide the country towards co-positioning plans and forecasting for both IM and SC in its accelerated plan. As Nigeria prepares to roll out its DMPA-SC accelerated introduction plan, it is hopeful that the finding will not only provide information, but be a useful resource for planning and policy formulation on DMPA-SC.</p>",

      "title": "Tell us how you really feel: Mixed-method assessment of user preferences for six new contraceptive methods in Burkina Faso and Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Many women in developing countries who want to avoid pregnancy do not use modern contraceptives for reasons that could be addressed by adapting current methods or developing new technologies. With growing interest in long-acting contraception, the development of new methods that would protect from pregnancy for six months or longer while better meeting women’s needs could enhance contraceptive uptake and continuation. Six new longer-acting contraceptive methods are currently under development or only available in limited markets, including a longer-acting injectable, a single-rod implant, a biodegradable implant, a copper IUD with a different size and shape, a more affordable hormone-releasing IUD, and a non-surgical permanent contraceptive.</p><p> </p><p>Acceptability research provides insight into potential users’ needs and preferences and helps to guide research and development investment. We conducted a study in Burkina Faso and Uganda to gauge potential acceptance of the six products. When the study began in 2016, 22% of Burkinabe women used modern contraceptives. Implants dominated the method mix among married women, while male condoms were most common among unmarried users. In Uganda, 28% of women used a modern method and injectables were the most widely used contraceptive across user groups.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Specific objectives were to estimate potential interest in the six new contraceptive technologies among potential users, explore socio-demographic and contraceptive use characteristics associated with interest in the six new methods, and identify the advantages and disadvantages of the six methods from the perspectives of women, men, providers, and policy-makers.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-method study in Burkina Faso and Uganda between April 2016 and January 2017. We added a contraceptive acceptability module to the female questionnaire in Round 4 of the nationally representative PMA2020 survey, collecting data from 2,743 Burkinabe women of reproductive age and 2,403 Ugandan women. After describing methods, we asked women about interest in using each method and about their preferred method, inclusive of the six new methods and of their current or most recent method used in the last 12 months, as applicable. </p><p> </p><p>Qualitative data were collected in five PMA2020 enumeration areas spanning the capital and four other regions per country. We conducted 50 focus group discussions (FGDs) with women (including separate FGDs with current contraceptive users and non-users), 10 FGDs with men, 37 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with providers, and 15 key informant interviews across the two countries. </p><p> </p><p>We analyzed survey data to estimate the proportion of women expressing interest in using each method and the distribution of responses regarding their preferred method. Logistic regression analyses examined correlates of interest in using each method. Qualitative transcripts were uploaded into NVivo for coding and thematic analysis focused on each method’s perceived advantages and disadvantages. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The proportion of women interested in using the new methods in the future was highest for the longer-acting injectable and the single-rod implant. Over a third of women in both countries showed interest in the non-surgical permanent contraceptive. When asked about their preferred method, around 75% of current/recent method users in both countries chose one of the new methods and 25% their current/recent method. Among women who were not current/recent users, about 90% chose one of the new methods and 10% no method. The longer-acting injectable was the most commonly chosen preferred method in both groups in both countries. Finding amenorrhea acceptable and preferring methods lasting over one year were each significantly associated with interest in using most new methods.</p><p> </p><p>Qualitative interviews highlighted the convenience of a longer-acting injectable curbing return for resupply. Participants also liked the injectable’s familiar, discreet, and minimally invasive nature. The five-year duration was a key advantage noted for the single-rod implant, while providers and key informants also stated that a single-rod system eased insertion and removal. Negative perceptions of bleeding side effects were a recurring theme across methods, including heavy bleeding from the copper IUD and bleeding irregularities associated with the injectable or implants. Conversely, reduced dysmenorrhea symptoms and lighter periods after insertion of the hormone-releasing IUD were widely perceived as a benefit, though opinions on amenorrhea were divided. Biodegradability raised fears about side effects. Eliminating surgery for permanent contraception was perceived positively, but some participants remained uncomfortable with irreversible contraception.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>While the potential for courtesy bias and poor predictive validity must be considered in interpreting results, findings bring support for continued development and introduction efforts of longer-acting methods, including the six methods in the study. Results also provide valuable end-user feedback for designing and introducing products that will eventually be used. </p><p> </p><p>Interest in injectables and implants was substantially higher compared with IUDs. Interest in a non-surgical permanent contraceptive option was also relatively high, but identifying the right target group will be key for method success. Additionally, our findings point at some areas warranting attention when new products are ready for initial or expanded market introduction. One such area is the development of well-crafted messages that capitalize on the perceived advantages of the new methods, or conversely seek to address potential concerns. For example, marketing should draw attention to the potential of the hormone-releasing IUD to reduce bleeding and dysmenorrhea symptoms, while messages will need to focus on alleviating fears around the dissolving nature of the biodegradable implant. More broadly, findings provide an important reminder of the importance of appropriate counseling and messaging around bleeding changes for improved method acceptability and for increasing satisfaction and continuation rates. Support for longer-acting methods and perspectives on side effects and delivery systems should inform research and development decision-making to ensure product success.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In 2017, three quarters of the 89 million unintended pregnancies in developing regions occurred among women not using contraception, while an additional 10% occurred among women using traditional contraceptive methods. Developing new contraceptive methods that women want to use and can easily access has the potential to reduce unmet contraceptive need. A recent phase I clinical trial found that skin patches with dissolving microneedles are a safe, effective, and patient-preferred alternative to hypodermic needles for flu vaccination, and that they can be painlessly self-administered. Researchers from the Georgia Tech Institute of Technology are exploring the application of microneedle patch technology as a platform for contraceptive delivery for women. We conducted this study in India and Nigeria to obtain input from potential end-users on this new method, with a view to inform design decisions.</p><p>​India and Nigeria represent two distinct geographic and contraceptive contexts. Modern contraceptive prevalence among married women is 47.8% in India, and female sterilization is the most commonly used method. In Nigeria, 11% of all women use modern contraception. Male condoms are most common among unmarried women, and injectables among married women. Unmet need is 12.9% among married women in India and 12.7% among all women in Nigeria.</p><p></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objectives of this study are to explore initial acceptability of a microneedle contraceptive patch (MNP) among prospective end-users, define desired attributes of the MNP, and quantify the relative importance of selected MNP attributes.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p></p><p>We conducted this study in New Delhi, India, and Ibadan, Nigeria, using a sequential, exploratory design. The qualitative phase included 8 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 10 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with women, and 10 IDIs with providers per country. This was followed by a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey with 528 women in India in November 2017 and 920 women in Nigeria in March-April 2018 to elicit preferences for specified MNP attributes. Eligible women in 10 enumeration areas per country were listed and randomly selected. The DCE sample was stratified according to ever/never use of contraception and, in Nigeria, marital status. In India, all women were married; those sterilized were eligible based on pre-sterilization contraceptive use. </p><p> </p><p>In each country, the selection of MNP attributes and their levels for the DCE was informed by qualitative results and technical specifications. Cognitive interviewing with 10 women in India and eight women in Nigeria served to refine final survey versions. We used Sawtooth’s Choice-Based conjoint with Hierarchical Bayes procedure to estimate coefficients for the individual utilities of each attribute level. We also used Sawtooth’s market simulator to estimate the proportion of respondents who would prefer specific MNP profiles to a base profile. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p></p><p>Qualitative findings indicate that overall acceptability of a contraceptive MNP was high. Women and providers found it easy-to-use. Many women liked the potential for self-application, although they commonly said the first application should be by a provider, largely to learn correct use. One common concern, keeping use secret from others, manifested through discussions on where to apply the MNP and the potential for a skin rash. </p><p> </p><p>Six attributes were retained for the India DCE. In examining their relative importance, effect on period was four times more important than any of the other attributes, which included, in order of importance, duration of effectiveness, location, pain at application, skin reaction, and MNP size. For effect on period, regular menstruation had the highest part-worth utility, followed by irregular menstruation and amenorrhea. Market simulations show that the ideal MNP featuring preferred levels of all attributes would result in a higher relative preference of 45% compared to a realistic base medium-sized option placed on the wrist causing light-prick pain and a one-day rash and providing three-month protection with irregular periods. </p><p> </p><p>Because of the dominance of bleeding changes on women’s choices in India, women in Nigeria were randomly allocated to one of two versions of the survey – one that included effect on period, and one without. Other attributes and levels were similar. The Nigeria data offer a comparison point to India findings, and for the version without effect on period, reveal more nuances on stated preferences for other MNP attributes.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study provides important data on potential end user acceptability of a contraceptive MNP. We found that such a product holds appeal among women and providers in both India and Nigeria. While attribute levels included in the DCE must be considered when interpreting findings related to attribute importance (i.e., women’s choices were constrained to those available to them in the survey), the combined reliance on qualitative findings and feasibility considerations helps build confidence that the list of attributes featured in this study is both realistic and relevant. Notably, our approach yielded the same list in both countries, which suggests important key design considerations may hold across contexts.</p><p> </p><p>A contraceptive MNP represents an innovative approach to address critical access barriers to contraceptive uptake and continuation through self-administration. The level of pain that can realistically be expected from the microneedles, if any, appears to be acceptable. While these were not major concerns in DCE results from India, interference of skin reaction, patch size, and location of application with women’s desire for discreet use warrants attention.  Finally, while the MNP’s novel delivery system for contraceptive steroids may overcome perennial barriers to use, our findings reinforce the critical need to reduce side effects associated with existing methods, most notably, menstrual bleeding changes. </p><p> </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Avec un PIB par habitant largement au-dessus de la moyenne de ses voisins, le Gabon est classé comme pays à revenu intermédiaire. Mais à cause de sa faible population, environ 1,8 millions d’habitants, comparativement à ses potentialités économiques, le pays est resté officiellement pro nataliste avec des mesures tendant à encourager les ménages à faire plus d’enfants au cours des quatre dernières décennies, Selon l’EDSG-II 2012 une femme gabonaise a en moyenne 4,1 enfants à la fin de sa vie féconde (3,9 en milieu urbain et 6,1 en milieu rural). La fécondité des adolescentes est élevée avec 28% des jeunes filles âgées de 15-19 ans qui ont déjà commencé leur vie féconde. D’ailleurs, 23% étaient déjà mères au moment de l’enquête susmentionnée, dont 5% enceintes pour la première fois. L'accès à la Planification Familiale (PF) demeure encore faible avec une prévalence contraceptive qui est passée de 12% (EDSG, 2000) à 19% en 2012 (EDSG-II 2012). Actuellement 27% des femmes de 15-49 ans en union ont des besoins non satisfaits en matière de PF. En effet, 47% des femmes souhaitent retarder leur grossesse de deux ans ou plus, et 23% ne désirent plus avoir d'enfants. Cette situation est liée aux taux élevés de mortalité maternelle (avec 316 décès pour 100 000 naissances vivantes) et infantile (26 décès pour 1 000 naissances vivantes) (EDSG-II 2012).</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Un programme national de planification familiale performant procure à un pays de nombreux avantages tant du point de vue sanitaire que socio-économique (OMS, 2009, 2012). La PF permet aux femmes d'avoir le nombre d'enfants qu'elles désirent tout en améliorant leur santé  et la qualité de vie de leur famille. Cette étude a évalué les coûts et les avantages de l'augmentation des investissements en PF par le gouvernement gabonais pour la période 2014-2050. Plus spécifiquement, il a s’agit de :</p><ul>\t<li>Estimer et analyser les coûts de financement du programme PF;</li>\t<li>Analyser les bénéfices au plan socioéconomique de la PF au Gabon</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>L’outil Onehealth est utilisé pour mener cette analyse, car il offre une excellente solution intégrée pour la compréhension et du lien entre les coûts et les bénéfices de la PF. Son association avec l’outil Rapid permet de produire : (i) une analyse des coûts de différentes options de mise à l’échelle pour la PF, (ii) une analyse démographique des changements de la taille de la population et de sa structure, (iii) une analyse des impacts sur la santé et l’éducation, (iv) une analyse sectorielle des autres avantages sociaux et économiques de la PF, et enfin (v) une analyse de la faisabilité financière de l'extension des services de PF.</p><p>Afin de mieux apprécier les bienfaits d’un programme performant de PF, deux scénarii de mise à l’échelle ont été comparés avec la situation de référence : 1) une évolution tendancielle du taux de prévalence contraceptive (TPC) pour atteindre 56% en 2050, et 2) une augmentation substantielle du TPC pour atteindre un niveau de 50,6% en 2025 puis 75 % en 2050. Les données utilisées dans l’analyse proviennent de plusieurs sources dont les rapports d’enquêtes et une collecte de données quantitatives auprès des différents secteurs concernés par l’étude.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>En 2050, la population totale sera de 3,4 millions pour le scénario 2 contre 4,4 millions scenario 1. Selon des preuves internationales, la PF peut réduire la mortalité maternelle de près d’un tiers. Au Gabon, la mise en œuvre du scenario 2 pourra diminuer de moitié les décès maternels. Cela reflète bien un niveau appréciable de l’espacement des naissances conjugué à une baisse des grossesses précoces et de maternités tardives qui constituent des facteurs de risque importants. La PF aura contribué à éviter 16 748 décès néonataux et infantiles et 1024 décès de mères en union.</p><p>La PF permettra de faire des économies de ressources soit un gain de 8,1 millions $ équivalent à 4,050 milliards de CFA en 2050. Une nette amélioration de la productivité et des conditions de vie des populations.</p><p>Le coût en 2014 de la PF est estimé à 1,37 millions de dollars avec 54% accordé aux coûts de programme. Les charges en ressources ressources humaines occupent 21% et les produits contraceptifs 25%.</p><p>L’investissement dans la PF est porteur pour un pays en ce sens qu’elle garantit un retour sur investissement. Jusqu’en 2040, pour chaque dollar dépensé sur la PF, le Gabon pourra économiser 4 $ dans les deux secteurs (éducation primaire, la santé); et ce gain peut atteindre $ 8 en 2050.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>L’analyse montre que les coûts associés à la mise à l'échelle de la couverture de la PF au Gabon sont largement profitables et supportables par l’économie du pays. Un certain nombre d’implications politiques concrètes sont présentées afin d’accroître l'utilisation des méthodes contraceptives au Gabon:</p><ul>\t<li>L’atteinte des résultats visés pour un Gabon émergent exige de faire de l'accès universel à la contraception une des priorités du Gouvernement.

Dès lors, d’importants investissements sont à faire au sein de l’espace UEMOA, notamment dans le capital humain, l’emploi  et  la bonne gouvernance.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Le développement de l’éducation rencontre d’énormes difficultés dans de nombreux pays en développement surtout ceux d’Afrique subsaharienne. L’accès à une éducation de base de qualité pour tous les enfants constitue une préoccupation majeure pour tous les acteurs du système éducatif et les planificateurs. Pourtant, la problématique de l’accès universel et équitable à une éducation de qualité est comprise et partagée par tous. Elle s’inscrit dans les défis de l’humanité depuis la Conférence Mondiale sur l’Éducation Pour Tous (EPT) à JOMTIEN (1990) jusqu’à la définition des Objectifs du Développement Durable (ODD) à NEW YORK en 2015. De ce fait, de nombreux  pays en Afrique subsaharienne ont entrepris des efforts de développement des capacités éducatives depuis le primaire jusqu’au supérieur. Malgré cette volonté, des pays tels que la Côte d’Ivoire n’arrive pas à scolariser tous les enfants. Une  étude de l’UNICEF et ENSEA (2015) indique que 38% des enfants de 6 -11 ans et 47% des enfants de 12 -15 ans, soit 2 enfants sur 3 sont hors du système scolaire. L’un des facteurs de cette situation est la croissance rapide de la population résultant du solde naturel et migratoire qui  semble être une préoccupation pour les chercheurs et les autorités.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>La  Côte d’Ivoire est entrée dans la phase de transition démographique et sa population croît un rythme de 2,5% par an. Estimée à 23 millions d’habitants, la population ivoirienne va atteindre 43 millions d’habitants dans les 23 prochaines années. Cette croissance rapide de la population génère une demande sociale d’éducation importante dans certaines régions du pays. Ce qui suscite l’intérêt de la recherche sur les enjeux de la planification familiale dans la scolarisation des enfants. La question centrale de cette étude est : en quoi la planification familiale peut-elle avoir des effets positifs sur la scolarisation des enfants?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>La partie septentrionale de la Côte d’Ivoire a été retenue pour cette étude du fait qu’elle reste à la traine et tient toujours la dernière place en matière de la scolarisation des enfants. Aussi, la plupart des ménages des régions du Nord sont à faible revenu et enregistrent un nombre important d’enfants scolarisables. Cette étude s’inscrit dans une approche d’action publique combinée avec celle des acteurs locaux de l’éducation. Les données utilisées dans cette étude proviennent des annuaires statistiques de l’enseignement primaire et secondaire du Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale et de l’Enseignement Technique. Aussi, les Rapports d’État du Système Éducatif ivoirien (RESEN) de 2011, les données de l’Enquête sur le Niveau de Vie des ménages (ENV) de 2015, l’Enquête Démographique de Santé (EDS) de 2011-2012 et l’Enquête à Indicateurs Multiples 2016 ont été exploités.  Par ailleurs, les données qualitatives ont été recueillies grâce à des entretiens approfondis auprès de 50 acteurs de gestion de l’éducation  d’une part et d’autre part 100 parents d’élève dont 50 ont moins de 6 enfants et 50 ont plus de 10 enfants. Les données recueillies ont été traitées à l’aide de l’analyse statistique descriptive et explicative ainsi que le contenu des discours.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Les résultats démontrent une contribution significative de la planification familiale sur les deux facteurs explicatifs de la problématique de la scolarisation des enfants à savoir l’offre et la demande scolaire. Elle se positionne comme une stratégie efficace dans la politique éducative à travers ses implications positives sur les variables de résistances associées à la scolarisation. La baisse de la fécondité induit la diminution de la proportion des enfants au profit de la population active. Cette population qui devient de plus en plus nombreuse avec moins d’enfants à charge, constitue pour les autorités compétentes une opportunité d’économiser sur les services éducatifs. Cette économie va permettre l’amélioration de la qualité de l’éducation, l’application effective de la gratuité de l’école, le renforcement des infrastructures scolaires et du personnel enseignant, l’acquisition du matériel didactique et l’assainissement de l’environnement scolaire. Car la population scolaire est maitrisée grâce à la maitrise de la croissance naturelle. Cela va permettre également à l’État de renforcer la productivité économique, les investissements dans la technologie et les compétences à l’appui du développement économique dans cette partie septentrionale. Par ailleurs, les changements dans les modèles de fécondité et la composition des ménages ont des conséquences importantes sur les résultats de la scolarisation des enfants et, par conséquent, sur le bien-être et le développement économique. Car le coût de la scolarité fait que plusieurs enfants scolarisables se retrouvent hors du système éducatif. La planification des  naissances a pour but d’offrir une meilleure vie à la population.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>La présente étude se propose d’analyser les effets de la planification familiale sur la scolarisation des enfants dans les régions septentrionales du pays. Elle permet de mettre en évidence le lien entre la planification familiale et la scolarisation des enfants. La mise en place d’une véritable politique de planification familiale pourrait avoir des effets positifs sur l’accès et la rétention des élèves. Cette étude est d’un grand intérêt scientifique et d’une actualité sociale et politique forte, pour les pays en développement tels que la Côte d’Ivoire engagée dans différents plans et programmes pour le développement de son système éducatif.  Elle contribue à la recherche des stratégies et des mesures législatives pouvant permettre une meilleure adaptation des interventions, tant en ce qui concerne l’offre que la demande, dans la perspective de rendre celles-ci davantage efficaces.  Comme les variables de résistances associées à la scolarisation des enfants varient en nombre et en intensité selon la région, l’aide et la collaboration de la communauté s’avèrent indispensables à la réussite scolaire des enfants. L’étude réalisée peut être bénéfique aux décideurs et aux responsables des politiques scolaires ivoiriens car elle fournit des éléments d’information permettant de bâtir des projets et d’élaborer des programmes d’interventions auprès des communautés urbaines et rurales plus conformes à la réalité locale. Elle permet de renforcer les stratégies de sensibilisation de mass de façon permanente par le biais des activités l’Information-Éducation-Communication (IEC) pour toucher toutes les couches sociales vulnérables.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Tanzania has experienced an impeccably steady economic growth rate of over 7 percent, with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increasing from US$ 304.3 in 2001 to US$ 950.4 in 2014, and to US$ 979.1 in 2016. The services sector contributes the greatest share to GDP (52.2%), followed by Industry/ construction (25.4 %) and lastly agriculture and fishing (22.4%). The Population Census in 2012 shows that age dependency ratio was 92 implying that every 100 people between ages 15 – 64 supports 92 persons in 0 -14 and 65 years and above age groups. The emerging economic opportunities, including the discovery of gas and mineral resources, increasing foreign direct investment imply that the country’s development aspirations articulated in Vision 2025 can be achieved. The transformation in the age structure of the population can accelerate economic growth through a concept of demographic dividend (DD); as fertility rate and child dependency burden decline and the working-age population increase, the economy’s productivity will be enhanced.  Pathfinder International/Evidence to Action (E2A) is advocating leveraging the country population dynamics and the emerging economic opportunities as valuable drivers for socioeconomic transformation.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In response to growing enthusiasm among policymakers for the potential economic benefits of the current Tanzania’s population, Pathfinder International in Tanzania was funded by USAID to support the Government in conducting Demographic Dividend modelling activity using the DemDiv tool.  The model helps in designing multiple scenarios to show projected outcomes under each scenario. The scenarios are business as usual, economic emphasis scenario, economic and education scenario and combined scenario.</p>",

The scenarios are business as usual, economic emphasis scenario, economic and education scenario and combined scenario.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study was based on the review of the general literature on the demographic dividend, population dynamics and economic change in Tanzania.  The study also reviewed trends in national demographic and socioeconomic indicators derived from population censuses, Household Budget Survey, Demographic and Health Survey, macroeconomic and planning data from the National Bureau of Statistics and Ministry of Health and Social Welfare; and the UN Population Division.  The study used the modelling tool called DemDiv. Local participants engaged throughout the study included universities, economists, planners, and statisticians from 7 ministries. The modelling was based on four policy scenarios:</p>\t<li><strong>Business as Usual,</strong> where the prevailing lackluster performance in both the economic and demographic environments continues</li>\t<li><strong>Economic Emphasis</strong> where the country prioritizes economic reforms and investments to the level articulated in Vision 2025</li>\t<li><strong>Economic Emphasis and Moderate Family Planning</strong> where the country makes moderate investments in family planning and education while maintaining economic indicators at the Economic Emphasis Model </li>\t<li><strong>Combined Economic and Demographic Emphasis </strong>where the country simultaneously prioritizes investments in economic reforms as well as in family planning, education, health care, and governance.</li>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>This report shows Tanzania can achieve the envisioned upper middle-income status by 2055 if she adopts an integrated approach to investments that prioritises economic reforms and job creation as well as investing in human capital development. The country will need to facilitate rapid fertility rate decline to reduce the dependency burden and create a bulge in the working-age population. With the decline in fertility rate and other investments in human capital development and economic reforms, Tanzania’s income per capita will almost be at the level of a high-income country by 2055. Having a Social Emphasis strategy in combination with Economic Emphasis leads to a smaller population size and a smaller child dependency burden that increases savings that can be ploughed into investments while reducing the costs of social services. The report shows that if Tanzania invests consistently in the earmarked sectors as per the combined scenario, it is likely that by 2055, the country will have reduced its dependency ratio from 0.91 in 2015 to 0.58; Under-Five Mortality Rate will decline from 67 to 13; Human Development Index will grow from 0.442 to 0.775; per capita GDP will grow from US$967 to US$11,656.6; the gap between jobs created and the demand for jobs by the working age population will grow from 7.4m to 51.4m; and investment per capita will grow from US$261 to US$3,059.2,  while the Total Fertility Rate will drop from 5.2 to 2.5 and life expectancy at birth (female) will grow from 63.8 to 74.28.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "\t<li><strong>Improving Health and Wellbeing</strong></li><p>For a healthy and productive workforce and reduction of the high dependency burden, there is a need to address the current public health challenges which will also contribute towards fertility rate reduction. To ensure the next generation of the labor force will bear minimal disease burden, Tanzania must invest in improving public health and general health care services for its populace.</p>\t<li><strong>Enhancing access and quality of education and skill development</strong></li><p>To have a well-educated, skilled and competitive labor force in the global market, the country should focus on promoting progress to secondary and tertiary education, increasing access to technical and vocational institutions for skills development, and improving quality of education at all levels.</p>\t<li><strong>Accelerating Economic Growth, Employment and Entrepreneurship</strong></li><p>To achieve inclusive economic growth that creates enough decent jobs for the growing working-age population and achieve long-term development aspirations, there is need to create a conducive and attractive business environment for the private sector through improving the economic infrastructure (including energy, transport and communication), and addressing the shortage of high-level skills.</p>\t<li><strong>Strengthening Governance, Efficiency and Accountability</strong></li><p>Governance and accountability is a key, cross-cutting pillar in Tanzania Vision 2025 and is central to the success of the other pillars of the DD.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Despite the mounting interest in improving access to and utilization of family planning (FP), universally known among the working tools for population growth control with numerous benefits, contraceptives prevalence rates remain low in the Republic of Benin. The number of births per woman fell from 7 in 1980 to about 5 (4.8) in 2013 where modern contraceptive prevalence rate was estimated at 6.8% and 8.8% in 2001 and 2011/2012 respectively. FP’s underlying real benefits for maternal health and child survival to galvanize actions and advocate are scarce.</p><p>Recently, the benefits of family planning use have become a core component of the new concept, demographic dividend, developed to highlight supports that changes in age structure of a population could provide for the economic development of that country. The concept has, then, become a key component drawing attention of policy makers where potential economic benefits of the demographic dividend and the policies required to achieve it are well-documented at the global level. An empirically sound projection model that can be readily applied in any high- fertility country to project demographic dividend (Moreland et al., 2014) is now available. This study projected FP use’s benefits for maternal health and child survival over Sustainable</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Even though the demographic dividend model used is conceived for multisector impact evaluation, it also allows to examine the impact of single sector policies. This study applied the model (DemDiv), to explore the benefits of family planning policy options for Benin Republic for maternal health and child survival over the Sustainable Development Goals time, vision 2030. More specifically, it explored maternal and child deaths that could be averted between 2015 and 2030 based on three family planning policy options in the Republic of Benin.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The DemDiv created by the Health Policy Project (Moreland et al., 2014) using a large range of data was applied based exclusively on assumptions on FP policy options.</p><p>To assess the impacts of FP use, two scenarios were developed. The two scenarios made were:</p>\t<li>First scenario: a base case scenario of no changes in FP, education and economic policies variables,</li>\t<li>Second scenario: an FP – only scenarios of improvements in contraceptive variables alone. Prospects on changes in FP use were made based on recent changes in FP use through previous commitments and on plan of actions for future FP prospects namely changes in FP use according to Benin previous DHS and the government’s Family Planning 2020 (FP2020). The present study envisaged an increase in contraceptive use according to three hypotheses:</li><ul>\t<li>Low hypothesis: modern contraceptive will increase following the previous rate of increase (2.07% annually) to reach the level of 17.9% by 2050;</li>\t<li>Moderate hypothesis: Modern contraceptive use will, increase to reach the level of 38.9% by 2050;</li>\t<li>Most optimistic hypothesis: this is based on current family planning 2020 commitments. Modern contraceptive use will reach the top level of 60% by 2050. </li></ul>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Even with the focus of FP sector alone, the modelling exercise showed potentials benefits of FP use as those underlying more sectors highlighted in other settings (NCPD &amp; HPP, 2014; Uganda National Planning Authority, 2014; Vlassoff et al., 2014). The modelling exercise shows that under the base scenario, however unrealistic, with no improvements in FP, education and economic variables, the fertility rate would remain the same in 2030 as it was 2015 – about 4.5 children per woman. In contrast, the benefits of FP use for maternal health and child survival vary drastically in proportion of the level of achievement in access to and use of contraceptives – the greater the achievement, the greater the dividends in term of gains in maternal and child deaths averted. Under the optimistic scenario, increasing access to and use of FP alone from 7.9% (in 2015) to 33.95% (2030) will save lives of about 200,000 under five year children and 10,000 mothers by 2030. In addition, the average number of children per woman will fall to 3.5 increasing the current female life expectancy by 5 years. Benin’s age structure will be balanced with more working age people. The country will also record an increase in its human development indicator.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Family planning is the heart of the demographic dividend concept even if all three components (family planning, education, and economy) of the concept are dependents and requiring working across sectors. High demand for children, consequence of the low family planning uptake and high maternal and child mortality were among the main challenges that Benin faces in its efforts for socioeconomic development of the country by reducing fertility. The current study examined the benefits of FP use focusing on its benefits for both mothers and children below the age of five years using Demographic Dividend Model (DemDiv) created by the Health Policy Project. To avert thousands of maternal and children deaths and undergo a steady fertility decline to reach an age structure concentrated into the working ages, Benin must strengthen policies toward voluntary family planning programmes enabling couples to realise their reproductive preferences while simultaneously improving education and economic environments. Under an unrealistic scenario of no improvement in education and economic, family planning use alone which was the focus of the current investigation will save lives of thousands of mothers and children and contribute to the economic environment improvement and population well-being. Under the most optimistic scenario based on Benin government’s Family Fanning 2020 (FP2020) commitments increasing modern contraceptive rate to just 33.95% by 2030, Benin will save lives of about 10,000 mothers from dying maternal deaths and about 200,000 children from dying preventable deaths before their fifth birthday.</p>",

      "title": "Unlocking Youth Potential to Harness the Demographic Dividend (DD): Evidence from National Demographic Dividend profile in Rwanda  ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Rwanda’s demographic profile is characterised by rapid population growth, youthful age structure, and rapidly growing urban population. Rwanda’s population is heavily youthful, with 40.1 percent being under age 15; 20 percent between 15 and 24, and 68.7 below age 30 (NISR 4th PHC 2012, Thematic report, Population projections, 2014). This translates to a total dependency burden of 76 per 100 people of working age in 2015. The rapidly growing population and consequent high population density (415 inhabitants per kms in 2012), will continually pose huge economic and environmental constraints.</p><p>The high child dependency burden has important ramifications for economic productivity. Parents with many children tend to struggle to provide for the health, education and other needs of their children, which undermines the quality of human capital in the next generation of the workforce. High fertility rate is also associated with low levels of female education and limited participation of women in the formal labour market. Rwanda’s economy has grown at a steady average rate of 7.9 % between 2001 and 2016, resulting in an increase in per capita GDP from $211 to $729.</p><p>This paper depicts Rwanda’s possibilities to unlock youth potential to harness the Demographic Dividend. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Main research assumptions for this study were:</p><ul>\t<li><strong>Business as usual:</strong> Characterised by slow progress in economic reforms, human capital development and reduction in fertility by 2050;</li>\t<li><strong>Economic emphasis:</strong> Optimises Rwanda’s global competitiveness, productive efficiency and governance as outlined in Vision 2020;</li>\t<li><strong>Social emphasis:</strong> Maximises investments in education and investments aimed at reducing fertility level including FP, while maintaining investments in the economic sector at a moderate level;</li>\t<li><strong>Combined emphasis:</strong> Concurrent maximising investments and reforms in the economic sector, FP and education to prevent unplanned births, build high-quality human capital and increase productive population.</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study, conducted in Rwanda in 2017, combined methodologies including desk reviews to collate and interpret secondary data and indicators. Further analysis of existing data to fill particular evidence gaps was conducted; policy scenario modelling to demonstrate potential DD that the country can harness under different policy scenarios developed; and assessment of policy responses that Rwanda can adopt to optimize its chances of harnessing the DD was done.</p><p>Secondary data and indicators were collated and further analyses of existing data carried out to establish past trends and the current status of various development indicators. These data, along with the analysis of the policy framework, were used to set target indicators for the modelling exercise. National data sets were used and supplemented with international data sets, where national data were not available. The national data were mainly derived from Population and Housing Censuses (PHCs), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), integrated household living conditions surveys, economic reports and national accounts reports. The DD modelling tool created by the Health Policy Project (HPP) at Futures Group with support from USAID (Moreland <em>et al</em>., 2014) was used at national level to demonstrate the potential DD that the country can harness under different policy scenarios.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The results of the study show that Rwanda will achieve a favourable age structure change under the Social and Combined scenarios that lead to a working-age bulge and reduced child dependency. Under the Combined scenario, which is the best recommended, the fertility rate will decline to 2.3 children per woman by 2050, the population will increase to 22.1 million people and the proportion of children below 15 years will constitute 28 percent of the population. As a result, the dependency ratio will decline to 0.53. The low child dependency both at household and national level, will free up resources for greater investments in education and health and enable greater savings. However, a key first step for Rwanda to reduce the child dependency ratio and open the window of opportunity for harnessing the DD is to facilitate rapid voluntary fertility decline by ensuring universal access to family planning, enhancing female education, and reinforcing efforts in reducing child mortality.</p><p>According to the model, the level of economic growth that Rwanda envisages towards Vision 2050 will only be achieved under Combined scenario, which would generate a GDP per capita of US$4,015 by 2035, US$12,555 by 2050 and a dividend of US$ 3,457 per capita.</p><p>The primary message of the modelling results is that to achieve its transformation aspirations, Rwanda should embrace an integrated development model that simultaneously prioritises economic reforms to accelerate growth and create jobs and investments in the social sectors to have an empowered, healthy, and globally competitive workforce.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study seeks to contribute to filling particular evidence gaps in our knowledge of the demographic dividend with special emphasis on young people. More specifically, the study sheds light on the channels through which a country in a given demographic disparity and depending on the choice of investment can or cannot benefit from its increasing human capital. This paper contributes to the knowledge of demographic dividend and extends its analysis by looking at the potential that Rwanda has, to harness its demographic dividend and highlights policy recommendations specific to the country in line with its aspirations to graduate from a low income to an upper middle-income country by 2050.</p><p>The biggest puzzle facing African leaders today, Rwanda included, is how to turn its population into agents of sustainable development. This study has shown that investment in family planning would reduce fertility rates therefore changing the population age structure. The shift in population age structure can yield economic benefits if only the change is accompanied by sustained investments in education, skills development, health, job creation and good governance. This change can boost economic growth through increased productivity of the comparatively large proportion of working-age population. Investment in young people is therefore inevitable to harnessing demographic dividend.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the demographic dividend is not automatic nor guaranteed; the country will have to wisely invest in interventions that will simultaneous accelerate fertility decline improve education and creates decent jobs for sustainable economic development.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The contribution of demographic intelligence to the discourse on sustainable development can be demonstrated by the demographic transition theory. The theory identifies different stages of demographic transition based on fertility and mortality levels.</p><p>As countries experience the different stages of demographic transition in their process of development, a window of demographic opportunity opens resulting from the ‘youth bulge’. This bulge is indicative of a large working age population with potential to yield a demographic dividend if appropriate investments are made. The dividend, however, is a limited window of opportunity and, thus, countries need to ensure timely implementation of effective policies to realize the dividend and sustain the gains in a sustainable manner.</p><p>Zambia’s youthful population of young people aged 15-35 (36.7% of Zambia’s population), the largest population of young people in its history, present an enormous opportunity to transform the future. </p><p>Despite Zambia experiencing sustained economic growth over the past decade, the country is also experiencing growing inequalities (Gini Coefficient 0.69) with multi-dimensional poverty and high unemployment rate of 7.9% (17% women and 25% youth), demonstrating that more needed to be done if the country is to realise its Vision 20130 of becoming a prosperous middle income country.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>This paper demonstrates how vital evidence on Zambia’s population dynamics derived from the demographic dividend study of 2015 and subsequent related national and sub-national diagnostics, was critical in shaping Zambia’s Development Agenda for the next five years, as demonstrated by the Seventh National Development Plan (2017-2021).</p><p>The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the demographic dividend study was relevant to development of priority policy and programme options in the country’s medium term economic development plan. The paper shares how best to use research evidence to information policy and development planning in the country.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>An analysis of Zambia’s 7th National Development Plan (7NDP) was undertaken against the critical evidence and recommendations from the demographic dividend study conducted in Zambia in 2014 and 2015 using the DemDiv model, as well as subsequent national and sub-national diagnostics of macro-economic and social parameters required to trigger the needed socio-economic changes.</p><p>The paper critically analyses to what extent the 7NDP incorporates key elements of the combined scenario of attaining the socioeconomic transformation by prioritization of family planning and education in addition to economic competitiveness and good governance reforms, which was considered to be the best option from the demographic dividend study. The authors review critical recommendations from the demographic dividend study that informed Zambia’s national development plan and highlights specific policy decisions in the national development plan that are likely to enable the country harness the demographic dividend.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The 7NDP indicates that the formulation of the plan was informed by the need to harness the demographic dividend in view of Zambia’s youthful population as highlighted in the demographic dividend study. Critical sections of the 7NDP that drew specific lessons from the Demographic Dividend Study include section 1, section, 3, and section 4.</p><p></p><p>Family Planning in the 7NDP:</p><p>The 7NDP acknowledges the country’s rapid population growth fuelled by persistently high fertility rate despite increasing contraceptive prevalence rate over a 20-year period from 9% in 1992 to 45% in 2013. Under the Human Development Pillar, Zambia plans to strengthen health systems and services using the primary health care approach, including family planning promotion.</p><p>Education in the 7NDP</p><p>Informed by findings from the demographic dividend study, the 7NDP acknowledges that one of the key challenges in Zambia’s education system is the reduction in progression rates across education levels as measured by the Net Enrolment Rates. The country plans to enhance access to quality, and inclusive education and enhanced access to skills training. The plan further highlights the need to keep girls in school and preventing child marriages and teenage pregnancies.</p><p>Economic competitiveness and good governance reforms in the 7NDP </p><p>Informed by lessons from the “Asian tigers” highlighted in the demographic dividend study, the 7NDP envisions that Zambia can reposition herself as a developmental state by addressing imbalances between economic growth and social development, through various policy instruments to expand economic opportunities, efficient application of resources to address poverty, and improved governance.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Considering the three overarching pillars of Zambia’s Vision 2030 namely (a) Economic growth and wealth creation; (b) Social investment and Human Development, and (c) Creating an enabling environment for sustainable socioeconomic development; Zambia’s demographic dividend study generated policy and programme relevant evidence that contributed to the knowledge base for the development agenda. In particular, it provided new knowledge on the potential impact of combined investments in social and economic dimensions as compared to the model previously used which was biased towards only economic reforms. The social dimensions of investments especially FP, health, education and governance have been shown in this study to be beneficial to harnessing the demographic dividend. The study provided direction on what the Zambian government needed to do to harness the demographic dividend through different policy and investment scenarios. The modelling approach employed provided a powerful tool to engage Zambian policy and decision makers in conversations, considering the potential socioeconomic transformation and transition into a prosperous middle income country by 2030. The study also triggered further undertaking of national and sub-national diagnostics of key macro-economic and social parameters, which enabled the country have in-depth understanding of the national development outlook.</p>",

      "title": " What Works to Engage Men as Contraceptive Users, Partners and Health Advocates",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning has traditionally been viewed as a woman’s responsibility and most family planning programs and services are directed at women.  However, there is growing recognition that positive male engagement in family planning has the potential to improve sexual and reproductive health for both men and women.  Evidence suggests that male involvement programs can influence spousal communication, gender-equitable attitudes, and demand for family planning.  Despite a long history of research and programming on male involvement, there is little evidence on what qualifies as promising practices for engaging men in family planning.  Moreover, there is a gap in knowledge among researchers and program implementers on how to scale-up successful male involvement programs, how scale-up of these programs is measured and what the evidence for impact is.  Over the last two decades, the Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) and partners have tested diverse approaches to engage men across the life cycle, including early adolescents, new parents and community elders. This presentation will draw upon results of implementation science initiatives across the globe to cull lessons learned regarding what works and what does not in engaging men as contraceptive users, supportive partners and health advocates.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Work engaging men at IRH began in 1997 with operations research on couple approaches to integrating the Standard Days Method into family planning programs. Since then programs including Tekponon Jekuagou, GREAT, Choices, REAL Fathers, FACT, Transforming Masculinities and Bien Grandir have yielded evidence and lessons learned on what does and does not work to positively engage men in sexual and reproductive health and to meet their own needs. Implemented together with partners – in particular Save the Children, Plan International, CARE and TearFund, program outcomes spanned the spectrum from gender equitable relationships to intimate partner violence, positive parenting and contraceptive</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Results are presented from a range of research methods used in these implementation science initiatives  including formative research (ethnographic approaches, focus groups and in-depth interviews with men, women, couples, program implementers and stakeholders, life histories);  summative research (quasi-experimental and RCT designs using pre and  post interviews and ego-centric social mapping with women, men, couples, girls and boys. Learning drawn from monitoring data and scale up assessments using LQAS, systematic observation, benchmarking and data on fidelity and coverage will also be shared</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Synthesis of research and program learning revealed eight lessons spanning the program cycle from formative research and program design to evaluation and scale-up. These include: 1) Learn what boys and men want, need and prefer and design programs accordingly; 2) Recognize and address gender power dynamics and the consequential influence of masculinities; 3) Remember that men are not static or one-dimensional (multiple masculinities, concerns, roles); 4) Meet men where they are emotionally and physically; 5) Consider men’s needs across the life course and apply a socio-ecological lens; 6) Check and address assumptions about boys and men; 7) Address men as clients and users in their own right; and 8) Avoid pilots to nowhere- design and implement with scalability and integration in mind. Results revealed that men receive much of their information and influence through male networks. Baseline survey data from Transforming Masculinities in Kinshasa showed that while women look to partners and mothers-in-law for FP advice, men relied on fathers-in-law and faith leaders. Identifying and engaging men's reference groups proved effective; in Benin men who believed their network members used FP were 2.5 times more likely to use contraception. Reducing unmet need is an important goal, however, as customarily defined it is female-centric and biologically-driven. Research in Benin showed that men and women’s actual and perceived unmet need varied substantially- suggesting the need to understand and address unmet need from men’s perspectives, as well as women’s.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>These lessons highlight the importance of learning about men's motivations, needs and preferences and recognizing the consequential influence of masculinities. Successful programs meet men where they are –emotionally and physically; consider their needs across the life course and apply a socio-ecological lens. Our research demonstrates that there is often dissonance between the perceptions of program implementers and providers and men and women on the importance of engaging men. Good quality formative/diagnostic research is needed to help us look beyond our own, often unexplored, assumptions and biases. Formative research is often an essential starting point, for example revealing motivations for newly married men/parents to reduce alcohol use, use non-violent conflict resolution approaches, communicate with partners and use contraception. Men, like women, have diverse needs and perspectives, and are also affected by their class, race, age, ethnicity and other social factors. Thoughtful research can help us unpeel these multiple masculinities. Once we better understand of the diversity of men, we can segment and approach them appropriately. It is also important to remember that it is not enough to address gendered attitudes and roles, we must also apply an understanding of gender dynamics to program implementation. Finally, the underlying question we struggle with has not yet been answered and merits continued reflection. Who are we trying to benefit? Are we primarily interested as men as a means to empowering women, or do men matter in their own right?</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Male participation in family planning is always a challenge in India and it becomes more challenging in urban health context. Family Planning method use in India is dominated by limiting method used by women. Recent National Family Health Survey reveals that the modern contraceptive prevalence rate in India is 47.8% which includes 36.0% of female sterilization and only 0.3% of male sterilization. Considering huge commitments under FP2020, male participation in urban areas can contribute significantly to achieve desired results. Urban Health Initiative project and Expanded Access and quality project in Uttar Pradesh – India implemented male engagement strategies to generate evidences as high impact interventions to be scaled up in other geographies</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Program intervention were mostly based on removing myths and working with those male groups where these myths esist. The four key interventions were implemented i.e. a) Chouraha approach (male gathering points, b) Rickshow pullar intervention, c) workplace interventions and d) night meeting in slums. These are the points where men are available in group to be counselled and for discussion on FP and male engagement.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>both the project implemented almost same strategies at different point of time. Urban Health Initiative implemented the same in 11 cities followed by EAQ in 10 cities. Male engagement team was hired and trained on informed choice counselling to men with a focus on Non Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV). Activities were designed to address the myths and targeting of audience were done accordingly. Chouraha Approach, rickshaw puller intervention, evening meeting and work place interventions were implemented in urban slums of 11 and 10 cities by UHI and EAQ respectively. Data systematically collected, recorded and analyzed to guide program implementation. Data was also uploaded by government on existing government HMIS and online portal. Private surgeons were also trained on NSV to ensure significant coverage of NSV services and to expand the choice for urban poor to quality NSV services. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>between 2012 to 2015, the UHI 11 cities (16% of the total cities) contributed 70 % of NSV clients of the state. Similarly, in EAQ, in project geographies NSV contributed 15% of total sterilization which is much higher than state (</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Male engagement in family planning requires a dedicated, trained and skilled team to work boldly with men and to address myths prevailing. Acceptance of NSV services is high if informed choice counselling is provided to targeted men. Private sector presence in urban areas helps quick and quality NSV services. Targeting male groups and addressing specific myths increases NSV coverage. There is no severe complication, adverse event, morbidity or mortality reported in the cities. A cost effective replicable strategy can contribute in FP2020 and can significantly change the method mix pattern in urban India. The strategy can significantly increase the use of other method as male is key decision maker in family.</p>",

      "title": "On the Verge: Is Kenya ready to add vasectomy to its method mix?",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Kenya has one of the most effective family planning programs and highest levels of modern contraceptive use in sub-Saharan Africa (mCPR 59.9% among married women, PMA2020 R5, 2016). It also has a fairly well-diversified method mix, with 5 methods—pills, injectables, implants, IUDs, and female sterilization—each having at least a 5% share and no method having more than half of modern method use. Kenya has the highest prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa of both implant use (18.1% CPR; 30.2% share) and IUD use (3.5% CPR; 5.9% share), and one of the highest levels of female sterilization use (3.1%)—all suggesting wide client interest in longer-term contraception. Vasectomy prevalence, however, is negligible (0.0%,2014 Kenya DHS), even though the demand to limit births exceeds the demand to space births in Kenya, as it does in many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Van Lith, et al, <em>Global Health: Science and Practice</em>, 2013). Noteworthy, if still modest, interest in vasectomy was recently demonstrated, however, during World Vasectomy Day, held in Nairobi in 2016. During this well-publicized series of events, 75 men chose to have a vasectomy.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Is Kenya able and ready to include vasectomy in the range of method options made widely available to clients? To assess the feasibility of wider introduction of vasectomy in Kenya, IntraHealth International and the Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) set out to learn more about vasectomy acceptors, providers, and other stakeholders using two main questions:</p><ul>\t<li>What are the factors that influence vasectomy demand and supply, as well as the context within which procedures take place in Kenya?</li>\t<li>What is the feasibility of wider introduction of vasectomy in Kenya through a collaboration with MOH (national and county) and stakeholders? </li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>This qualitative study was based on a phenomenological approach, and used a cross-sectional survey design, in which respondents from four Kenyan counties were interviewed by five trained data collectors between January and April 2018. Our sample consisted of 19 vasectomized men, seven vasectomy providers, and eight stakeholders selected through a purposive sampling method. Semi-structured interviews with participants were conducted to assess the prevalence of certain characteristics and experiences of vasectomy users, and the attitudes and perspectives of vasectomy providers and stakeholders in Nairobi, Busia, Kakamega, and Kisumu counties. Verbal consent was obtained for all respondents, and human subjects protection measures were respected. The Kenyatta University Ethics Review Committee approved this study for data collection. Emerging themes were identified by reading data collector field notes from these 34 interviews. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Vasectomy acceptors on average were 42 years old and had five children. While most had at least completed secondary school, as is typical with early adoption of vasectomy in Africa, 32% of the men (6 of 19) had only a primary education or less. These men learned about vasectomy from community health volunteers. Other ways men found out about vasectomy included post-partum clinic visits, the 2016 World Vasectomy Day campaign, self-study, pre-marital counseling, and from family members. The main motivations for users—suggesting possible future information, education and communication/behavior change communication messages— included the men’s: 1) wanting to take joint responsibility for family planning with their partner; 2) concern for their partner’s health; 3) feeling responsibility for their family’s overall well-being; and 4) realizing the economic benefits from limiting further births in the family. However, common misconceptions and barriers still stand in the way of increased vasectomy uptake in Kenya. These include confusion with castration, a fear of a reduction in sexual abilities or physical strength, social stigma (including from partners), and the cost/affordability of the procedure. Most respondents—vasectomy users, providers, and stakeholders—were agreeable to serving as vasectomy champions in various ways. Several users and providers are currently doing so through their own support groups, social media advocacy, and sharing their vasectomy experience with friends, family, and strangers.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Wider introduction of vasectomy in Kenya should be encouraged through a “champion’s network”—a collaboration among motivated vasectomy users, providers, stakeholders, and national and county ministries of health. This network would be an ideal platform to craft and customize awareness campaigns that dispel deep-rooted myths and misconceptions, encourage men to become more involved in family planning decisions, and offer couples a safe, simple, and highly-effective permanent method of contraception for men. Awareness campaigns for the public are not enough; there also needs to be: 1) more education and acceptance of vasectomy as a family planning option among all health workers; 2) more trained and enabled providers of no-scalpel vasectomy and other male-friendly services; 3) targeted messages that speak to specific populations (e.g., religious/tribal leaders, more/less educated, women as well as men) using both social and traditional mass media; and 4) increased use of community health workers to spread awareness at the individual level. In addition, programs must ensure that the service is affordable. Busia and Kakamega counties’ successes in employing community health volunteers to increase vasectomy awareness and uptake is an encouraging sign that non-traditional populations for vasectomy (rural men, and those without a secondary education) are also receptive markets. The creation of a vasectomy champion’s network could be the start to establishing vasectomy as a desired family planning program method, one increasingly chosen in Kenya.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In line with international efforts to include men in family planning and to modify inequitable gender relations, Mexico has established a Reproductive Health Program with national coverage, where vasectomy services are included. However, participation of men in family planning continues to be insufficient. The literature on the topic is scarce, however some authors explained that the low male participation in family planning is related to social norms, in which contraception is traditionally assumed to be a women’s responsibility. In 2014, results from the National Survey of Demographic Dynamics in Mexico showed that only 14.4% of women reported that their partner played an active role in family planning. Mexico joined the World Vasectomy Day (WVD) global campaign, to promote the participation of men in family planning, particularly through no-scalpel vasectomy (NSV). This celebration is part of the efforts made in recent years to promote free vasectomy services. As part of WVD, a “vasectomy-athon” was also held, where Mexico City joined the worldwide effort to perform uninterrupted NSV for 24 hours in mobile units and primary care facilities. As a result of this global campaign, 6,477 vasectomies were performed in the country and it is estimated that around 15,000 worldwide.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study explored the main reasons and concerns that led men to seek a NSV during the “vasectomy-athon” and followed-up them and their partners to learn about their experience with NSV and the effects, if any, on their relationships and sexual performance.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A cross-sectional study was carried out in the T-III Health Center “Dr. Manuel Escontría” and in mobile units located at the “Monumento a la Revolución”. The study sample consisted of 116 men who answered a survey structured in two sections: 1) on reasons, previous knowledge and concerns about NSV that was collected before the surgery; 2) on the understanding of post-surgical care measures collected immediately after surgery and after receiving surgical care indications. The survey included multiple choice questions about reasons to perform a vasectomy; main concerns; previous search for NSV services and reasons why they had not undergone the procedure before; with whom they discussed the procedure and if a person recommended it; prior knowledge of NSV that consisted of multiple answers in order to know if their knowledge about the procedure was correct or incorrect; contraception method used more frequently prior to VSB, satisfaction with the procedure, among others. A follow-up survey to assess their experience with NSV and the effects in their relationships was conducted 6 months after the surgery.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Among respondents, 11.2 percent were young males under 25 years of age, 75.9 percent were between 25 and 44 years, and 12.9 percent were 45 years or older. The majority reported being married or in a stable relationship. The highest proportion of number of children was 1 to 3 children.  Four out of five men reported having more than secondary education. The latter sociodemographic findings are similar to that reported in other studies at the urban level However, 17.2 percent of the respondents, young people between 19-25 years, in this study reported not having any children at the time of the procedure. The most important reason reported for undergoing a NSV was to avoid unwanted pregnancies (58.6%), followed by a wish to support their partner on family planning (17.2%), and problems with partner’s health or genetic incompatibility (11.2%). Potential complications from the procedure such as pain and anesthesia were the main concerns in all age groups (45.7%).  In regard to the benefits, one-fourth of the men expected an increase in their sexual activity frequency (25%) and improvements in their relationship (13.8%). In the assessment of the understanding of post-surgical indications, 81.7 percent mentioned hygiene and aseptic measures, 52.9 percent that they must wait between 3 to 7 days to have sexual intercourse. In contrast, the need to continue using a condom to prevent STIs and the indication of having a sperm count after three months were only mentioned spontaneously, in both cases, by less than 4 percent of the respondents.</p><p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study contributes to increasing literature on men participation on family planning and highlights the need to disseminate quality information about NSV. The main concern of the NSV reported by men in the present study was related to complications or pain associated with the procedure. Fears regarding changes in masculinity or sexual performance are also latent in this population, so the incorporation of a multidisciplinary team that integrates counseling or psychological support is relevant. As well the integration of the urologist in reproductive health and family planning programs. It is interesting that young people between 19-25 years, without children accepted a NSV. This group also reported the highest unmet need for NSV at the time of the survey. The latter highlights the need to expand the scope of family planning programs and guide and offer reversible or definitive planning methods to women and men who do not wish to have a family or for those who already have the desired number of children. While we are still in the process of finalizing the 6-month follow-up analysis, preliminary data suggests positive outcomes. Finally, based on the current study, it is recommended that the Ministry of Health continue integrating information, counseling and services for NSV within the National Family Planning Program.  Moreover, it would be beneficial for the Ministry of Health to periodically assess the availability and quality of NSV services in the public and private sectors in Mexico and continue to disseminate best practices and influence policies related to NSV worldwide.</p>",

      "title": "A long way to go: a systematic review to assess the utilisation of sexual and reproductive health services during humanitarian crises",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights are fundamental to individual health and well-being, as well as population health and development. An estimated 32 million women and girls of reproductive age live in crises settings, all of whom need SRH information and services. Humanitarian crises can increase the risk of poor SRH outcomes due to reduced access to services and supplies, damaged health facilities, and increased exposure to sexual violence among other factors, and have implications across the life cycle, e.g. increased risk of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.</p><p>While progress has been made with regard to the availability of SRH services in humanitarian crises, significant challenges remain with regard to utilisation of these services. These challenges are further compounded by overall gaps in health systems capacity. Recent systematic reviews have found that the absence of quality data on women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health in emergencies hinders design and implementation of sustainable interventions. They also indicate that the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for SRH has not being systematically implemented, and that core SRH services are being neglected (e.g. abortion, contraception). Failure to implement essential SRH services as an integrated package has significant consequences for individuals in humanitarian crises.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>A key challenge in improving utilisation of quality SRH services has been a lack of evidence. No systematic review to date has assessed the utilisation of SRH services in crises settings. Data are needed to not only inform how to most effectively increase utilisation of services, but also to advocate for the SRH needs of individuals living in humanitarian crises. We aimed to consolidate existing evidence for the utilisation of SRH interventions, including the MISP, in humanitarian crises by conducting a systematic review. This study aimed to assess the utilisation of SRH services in humanitarian crises from 1980-2017.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We based SRH search terms on standardised definitions from the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 and the WHO Reproductive Health Strategy. Search terms encompassed those used in international guidelines on SRH in humanitarian crises, including SRH activities on family planning, abortion, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections including prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), maternal and newborn health, and sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>We searched for both quantitative and qualitative peer-reviewed studies in the following databases: EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE and PsychINFO from January 1, 1980 to April 10, 2017. We complemented searches by screening reference lists of papers for potentially relevant studies, and reference lists of systematic reviews. We also consulted SRH service delivery and research experts to identify additional studies.</p><p>Outcomes of interest for inclusion were based on those from the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) field manual, as it is an established and widely used manual for SRH in crisis settings, and were selected based on discussion with a SRH expert committee. Two authors independently extracted and analysed data from published papers on the effect of SRH interventions on a range of SRH care utilisation outcomes in humanitarian crises, and used a narrative synthesis approach. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Of the 2,404 identified citations, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. The 23 included studies were conducted in 16 low- and middle-income countries with populations affected by armed conflict, natural disaster, or both. Between 1997 and 2009, nine papers were published that met our inclusion criteria. Between 2010 and 2015, 14 more papers were found. Of these 23 studies, 22 studies used cross-sectional, pre-post, and cohort study designs. One paper included in this review used qualitative research methods.</p><p>Only 52.1% of the studies (n=12) used quasi-experimental study designs which provided some statistical measure of difference between intervention and outcome. Overall, 39.1% of the studies (n=9) selected were graded as high quality, 39.1% moderate quality (n=9), and 17.4% low quality (n=4). There were common areas in which the included studies in this review provided low-quality reporting. First, all the moderate- and low-quality quantitative studies stated changes in utilisation outcomes, but statistical associations between the intervention and the outcome were not given. Second, it was also not clear whether relevant confounders and biases were considered during the design of the study and analysis of the data. </p><p>We found evidence of effectiveness in increasing SRH service utilisation for the following interventions: peer-led, interpersonal and mass media campaigns; community-based programming; and a three-tiered network of community-based reproductive and maternal health providers. We identified no studies with interventions specifically looking at PMTCT, vaginal injuries and fistula, post-abortion care, safe abortion, prevention of sexual violence and comprehensive clinical management of rape.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our study found evidence to support increased utilisation of SRH services through interpersonal, peer-led and mass media campaigns; community-based programming; and a three-tiered network of community-based reproductive and maternal health providers. Lower quality evidence was found to support wider literacy programmes, birth preparedness interventions, and training of lay SRH facilitators and staff. Statistical analysis was reported in only five studies (21.7%), signalling a lack of robust research in this field. Additionally, we did not identify any cost-effectiveness studies in this review, which is of concern as it highlights gaps in the economic data required by policymakers and programme implementers to deliver and scale up SRH services. It was not possible to synthesise findings by setting (e.g. camps, urban areas) or population type (e.g. adolescents, populations with disabilities), given the paucity of identified studies.</p><p>Despite increased attention to SRH service provision in humanitarian crises settings, the evidence base is still very limited. In addition to research on delivering and scaling up SRH services to different target populations, we should also consider implementation research in different humanitarian settings. For example, the private sector and informal providers may play a larger role in service delivery in protracted crises than in acute settings where non-governmental organisations may be delivering most of the services. Rigorous, timely and appropriate research, as well as high-quality evidence to support the use of different intervention designs, are needed to identify evidence-based interventions to increase utilisation of SRH services by key populations across a range of diverse crisis settings.</p>",

      "title": "An Integrated SRHR/FP Response to the evolving Sudanese Refugee Crisis in Adjumani, North Western Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uganda faces one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing refugee crises. War in South Sudan has forced more than 1.5 million refugees to seek asylum in the region. Interventions related to SRHR are few and inadequate to cater for the needs of the population. Services such as family planning, adolescent reproductive health, maternal and child care as well as services to address SGBV are not adequate. Relief organizations active in the camps do not generally offer integrated SRHR services, and few aid workers and service providers are trained in the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) that addresses SRHR in emergency situations. As such, the MISP is not adequately delivered. The population also does not have adequate information concerning the main SRHR issues such as preventing pregnancy, or how to address SGBV. As a result, there are many myths and misconceptions regarding SRH. This situation is compounded by a poor health system, characterized by a general lack of health workers, or few health workers trained in SRH. SRH commodities and supplies are also grossly inadequate, given the large numbers of refugees in need. Unfortunately, the HMIS data is sometimes not available or out of date to adequately inform decision making.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>RHU worked together with the respective government and private health facilities, and in partnership with development partners and other CSOs to close the gap regarding different SRHR/HIV services to the refugees from Southern Sudan to North Western Uganda, as well as host communities living near the refugee settings. These services incorporated the delivery of the MISP, that including family planning, HIV Counseling and Testing, STI and SGBV management, etc. This intervention also involved strengthening coordination and the capacity of different stakeholders such as community structures and the district leadership to address SRHR/FP issues  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Between April and June 2017, RHU dramatically increased refugees’ and host communities’, (who were the intended beneficiaries) access to SRHR/FP care, reaching more than 30 000 clients with SRHR/FP services. The operation sites were, Pagirinya, Maaji, Ayilo II and Nyumanzi refugee camps. The primary source of data was service statistics collected by data clerks and RHU staff personnel. The project was implemented in collaboration with the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM); UNHCR, and implementing partners such as Medical Teams International (MTI), and the Adjumani District Local Government.</p><p>The project provided SRHR emergency services through the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP); promoted behaviour change through RHU’s ecological model; and addressed longer term systemic problems through systems strengthening. RHU conducted community mobilization through mobilisers and the government Village Health Teams (VHTs); some of the younger mobilizers also acted as peer educators.</p><p></p><p>RHU delivered services, while also building the capacity of public and private health facilities to provide SRH services (this included the training of community agents and health workers, the sensitization of community leaders, as well as improved data capture). Through its outreach camp model, RHU rapidly expanded the MISP and helped to integrate SRHR services. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>SRHR problems encountered by the refugees are multiple, and include forced/early marriage; SGBV, STIs, including HIV, unsafe abortion, etc., and SRHR interventions are grossly inadequate. RHU’s objective was community empowerment in different aspects of SRHR, and improved partner coordination, of the humanitarian SRHR response, and to a degree, this was realised, though strategic partnerships are critical in doing so.</p><p>The intervention focused on delivering the MISP initiative by offering various SRHR/FP services. It also successfully promoted coordination with different district leaders and partners. RHU worked with different government and private facilities to transfer capacity. It was able to rapidly expand its area of coverage by an integrated package of SRHR/FP services. At different Reception Centres in the refugee settlements, and at designated government health facilities, etc., marginalised and hitherto underserved clients were offered care, or were referred for maternity or HIV ART services. However, the district lacked adequate staff, equipment and supplies to regularly and competently offer SRHR services, and these were severely constrained.</p><p>To address the challenge of SGBV, RHU also increased awareness about SGBV as a human rights issue, and sensitized the community on their rights, and on the importance of FP. In partnership with like-minded organizations, it conducted community mobilization by training and orienting specially selected SGBV mobilisers, then facilitating them to mobilize the targeted population. In this way, RHU strengthened and helped to build the adaptive and responsive capacity of Adjumani district and continued to support Uganda government’s emergency response and preparedness.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>With specific and targeted interventions, it is possible to increase refugees’ and host communities’ access to information and care. The MISP intervention systematically addressed the SRHR issues such as a lack of FP services. However, this intervention did not reach all eligible clients. Nonetheless, it was able to conduct integrated service delivery, thereby reducing on missed opportunities.</p><p>This intervention built on pre-existing community and cultural structures, including leaders and elders of influence in their respective communities, by harnessing their special knowledge and skills, highlighted the value of community consultation and participation in project success.</p><p>Overall the intervention strengthened coordination among key public and private sector stakeholders, leading to a more rational use of resources. Overall, it is clear that a holistic, all involvement approach and involvement of different key partners, and in a timely manner, is critical to project success.</p><p>Thus, it is necessary to also; adequately cater for all clients, by incorporating SRHR as an integral part of the health humanitarian response, and scale up and extend services to all. The capacity of MTI and the district to offer SRHR regularly and competently must be built, and the policy reviewed to ensure recruitment of adequate trained providers from both refugee and indigenous communities, to provide SRHR services.</p><p>The project has had a meaningful impact on the lives of all beneficiaries in the area of SRHR, including the local leadership and other NGOs, and has stimulated demand, and there is scope to replicate such an intervention in many different settings. </p>",

      "title": "Assessing clients' satisfaction and using feedback to improve quality of contraception services in Puntland, Somalia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Save the Children's (SC) Family Planning and Postabortion Care (FPPAC) program in Karkaar, Somalia aims to increase availability and utilization of modern contraceptive methods among targeted populations.  A high national fertility rate of 6.5 births per woman, combined with a low prevalence of modern contraception (2.5% among WRA) contributes to the high MMR of 732 deaths per 100,000 live births (UN Data, 2014; UNICEF, 2016).</p><p>Prior to SC's program, there were no existing contraception services in the region. Launched in 2012, the program has scaled up to provide services to 26,888 new acceptors of family planning (March 2018). SC, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH), does this through the provision of supplies, clinical trainings, health information system strengthening, and capacity building of the district and regional health offices in supervision and management.</p><p>While routine monitoring data and supportive supervision visits provide information on service quality, direct feedback from clients accessing services is an important component to improving services. Regularly conducting Client Exit Interviews (CEIs) allows the program to address key gaps, resulting in a higher level of service provision.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>SC supports the MoH Puntland to implement FP services at ten health facilities in Karkaar region, targeting a population of 309,488 of which 22% are women of reproductive age. Programmatic interventions are include service provision of the full range of modern contraception methods; active community engagement through targeted sensitization sessions with specific groups to encouraging uptake of modern methods of contraception; building capacity of district and regional level supervisors to train, coach, and mentor service providers in a sustainable way; instituting robust monitoring systems to track progress and program quality; and ensuring facilities are equipped with sufficient supplies and commodities.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The CEIs were conducted in all ten SC supported health facilities providing FP services in 2017. Four trained female interviewers spent a fully day at the exit of each SC supported health facility interviewing all consenting women of reproductive age (WRA) as they left the facility.  All WRA were asked to participate, regardless of their reason for attendance, and a minimum of 20 women were interviewed at each health facility. Bias was reduced by hiring external interviewers who were not linked to SC or the MoH. Interviews were conducted in a private area and no identifying information was recorded. The structured questionnaire was adapted from the USAID Basics Healthy Timing and Spacing of Pregnancies (HTSP) toolkit and modified for SC's program. Ultimately 252 women were interviewed from 10 health facilities. Responses were recorded on tablets using KoBo Toolbox, and analyzed in Excel.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results showed that 91% of clients were either somewhat or very satisfied with family planning services received and 98% of clients would recommend the FP services at this facility to friends and family.</p><p>Clients who accepted a FP method from this facility generally reported to have had positive experiences about counselling and services offered. Over 90% of clients were counselled on common side effects and how to manage those side effects, potential complications to monitor, and when to return for additional doses or check-ups. Clients’ feedback highlighted the need to train and support service providers to teach clients how to use specific FP methods and further involve clients in the decision-making process regarding which method was right for them.</p><p>When visiting the facility for non-family planning related reasons, only 18% of WRA reported that health providers discussed FP options, indicating the need to integrate FP into broader services at the primary health centers.  For women who were informed of FP options, 78% chose not to accept a method as they were currently breastfeeding.  This indicates a gap in providers' knowledge of postpartum FP methods and counselling.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>While overall satisfaction rates for FP clients at supported facilities in Karkaar are quite high, soliciting client feedback provided specific areas of focus for the program team to target work to improve overall quality of FP services. Supervisors have been coaching service providers to improve counselling techniques to promote client involvement and clear instructions to clients on how each method is used.</p><p>The majority (82%) of WRA who were at the facility for reasons unrelated to FP services were not informed about the possibility of free, comprehensive FP available at the same facility. Evidence shows increased uptake of contraception when services are integrated across MNCH services including immunization and nutrition programs. In order to better address the unmet need for contraception in Karkaar region and respond to client feedback, SC is training health workers across the primary health facilities on FP awareness and counselling. Referral tracking mechanisms will created to monitor whether this training and increased attention results in more women accessing FP while attending the facility for other types of services. Particular attention is placed on referrals for postpartum women as the team aims to integrate FP messaging across antenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care services to improve birth spacing and give women more reliable options than lactational amenorrhea.</p><p>The CEI methodology is a simple technique that is able to solicit immediate and pertinent feedback from clients accessing services.  This perspective is invaluable in program design, particularly when seeking to improve the quality of care for the service-user.</p>",

      "title": "Estimating the Impact of Family Planning Utilization in Humanitarian Settings in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uganda is one of the top ten countries in the world that hosts the largest number of refugees. As of January 01, 2018, the number of refugees arriving in the country had reached 1,395,146 more than at any time in the country’s history of which 52 percent were women and children. Humanitarian crises increase women and girls’ vulnerability to unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths and disability. In such situations, refugees and other displaced people are often left behind or underserved by existing programs and face significant challenges in accessing information and services that would allow them to plan, space or limit the number of children they desire. Family planning is an essential component of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 and is addressed specifically in SDG 3.7: “by 2030 ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programs”. It is key to preventing the social, economic and health consequences that result from unintended pregnancies.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>UNFPA has been working closely with the Ministry of Health and other implementing partners to ensure availability of a wide range of quality short, long acting and permanent family planning methods in humanitarian settings as part of the minimum initial service package (MISP). We assessed the impact of family planning use in humanitarian districts in Uganda including Yumbe, Moyo, Adjumani, Arua, Lamwo, Kiryandongo, Hoima, Kyegegwa, Kamwenge and Isingiro focusing on the 2013-2017 period.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In order to estimate the impact of family planning use on health, demographic and economic outcomes in humanitarian settings, we used Impact 2 – a mathematical model developed by Marie Stopes International. It estimates health, demographic, and economic impacts of family planning including unintended pregnancies, live births, maternal deaths, child deaths and disability adjusted life years averted; and maternal health costs averted among other metrics. The model is already pre-loaded with data for all developing countries, from sources including demographic health surveys, UN population prospects, UN maternal and child mortality data, Global Burden of Disease, and Guttmacher Institute. We entered family planning service data into Impact 2 focusing on the number of acceptors of short, long acting and permanent family planning methods over the last 5 years (2013 -2017). These data were obtained from the Ministry of Health District Health Information System (DHIS2) covering 57 health facilities in refugee settlements across the country.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During the period under review, 269,120 women and men from refugee and host communities accepted a range of family planning methods. The majority of clients (80%) accepted injectable depo provera, 12% accepted implants, 4% accepted intra uterine devices, 3% accessed pills whereas only 1% opted for permanent methods i.e. tubaligation and vasectomy. As a result, 76,545 unintended pregnancies, 41,748 live births, 160 maternal deaths and 1,769 child deaths were averted. Relatedly 149,569 child and 9, 955 maternal disability adjusted life years were averted. Additionally, USD 4,660,784 that would have been spent on maternal health care costs were saved.    </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Family planning is a low cost, high dividend investment that saves lives and improves maternal and child health outcomes coupled with reducing costs incurred on maternal health care. It is therefore vital to strengthen family planning service delivery during humanitarian crises as part of the minimum initial service package through provision of a full range of methods at health facilities and mobile clinics, capacity building for health workers, supply chain management among other strategies. Meeting family planning needs in humanitarian emergencies challenging but possible and presents opportunities for reaching marginalized, remote or otherwise underserved populations.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>There are now approximately 883,785 Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, who have crossed the border from Rakhine State, Myanmar seeking safety and essential services while fleeing atrocious violence. This massive Rohingya influx has created a huge burden on Cox’s Bazar’s health system and women seeking reproductive health services are among the most vulnerable. UNFPA has estimated more than 300,000 women of reproductive age (WRA), 4.9% who are currently pregnant, and 7% who are breastfeeding infants. Despite a large public health response from the Government of Bangladesh and international actors, including services targeted at WRA, the needs of this population are massive and coverage remains low. Only 22% of pregnant women deliver in facilities and women face immense physical and socio-cultural barriers to accessing reproductive health care they deserve.</p><p>Save the Children (SC) set up nine outpatient health posts throughout the Rohingya camps in October 2017. Taking an evidence-based approach, the program team ensured FP counselling and awareness was integrated into the outpatient department, vaccination, antenatal, and postnatal services at the health posts. While new FP clients are steadily increasing on a monthly basis, there is still a large unmet need particularly for adolescents and women in the postpartum period.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In January 2017, SC’s nutrition team opened mother-baby areas at each health post for infant and young child feeding (IYCF) support, targeting women with infants under 6 months to promote and support early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding. The RH and IYCF teams realized they were targeting the same population of postpartum women and could benefit from an integrated counselling and referral system. While both teams began inserting awareness sessions into trainings for midwifes, lactation counsellors, and community workers, more could be done. An external consultant was hired to look into integration of IYCF and health programming specifically for this context.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>While integration of MNCH services to promote uptake of family planning services has a strong evidence base, much less is known about opportunities for integration of FP with nutrition programs like IYCF in emergencies. The consultant used a desk review, semi-structured interviews, and a group discussion to identify barriers and facilitating factors for the integration of IYCF and reproductive health services as well as highlight areas to strengthen integrated programming for women in the postpartum period. The report has just been finalized and will be taken forward by the team from April 2017.</p><p>In order to evaluate the potential benefits of integrating breastfeeding services with family planning services, a robust monitoring system will be put in place to track referrals of clients between the mother-baby areas and the family planning counselling room. A column has been added to both the IYCF register and the FP register, asking the provider (either a midwife or lactational counsellor) if the client was counselled on family planning or breastfeeding. Referral slips will be given to women who would like to seek the other service and then collected once the service is provided. This will be tracked for the next 6 months.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The evaluation found that IYCF is indeed being delivered through RH services, and midwives have a working relationship with the IYCF team. Group discussions with the midwives revealed that midwives provide basic breastfeeding messaging (mostly limited to recommending early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding) and carry out a breast examination as part of ANC and PNC and observe a breastfeed when relevant. Further training of midwifes could enhance the quality of these counselling sessions, but referrals were happening to the mother-baby areas. The converse was not necessarily found to be true, however, with lactational counsellors rarely discussing FP options with women seeking IYCF services. More training will be provided so that IYCF staff feel confident discussing FP messages and encouraging referrals to the midwifes for contraceptive services.</p><p>New FP clients have been increasing since January 2018 due to multiple factors, but aided by the integrated physical layout of the facilities that placed the mother-baby areas directly beside the FP consultation rooms. By November, results from the robust monitoring framework detailing specific sources of referral for FP clients will be available to quantify whether this integration has been successful at promoting uptake of contraception for lactating women. The hypothesis is that with further training and job aids to help providers identify women who would benefit from referrals, both IYCF and FP clients will increase. Within the family planning program, we will specifically track trends in adolescent and postpartum women and whether referrals from mother-baby areas increase contraception uptake in this demographic.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Integration of FP and IYCF services are possible, even in the early stages of a large-scale emergency response. The evaluation found that integration of FP services with MNCH and IYCF services was possible in the early phase of the response due to an integrated strategy that set up cross-sectoral operational platforms and proposal development. At the time of mass displacement, health and nutrition services were completely lacking meaning there were opportunities to design integrated programs from scratch. Collaboration between health and nutrition teams allowed for shared trainings to sensitize staff on integrated health services.</p><p></p><p>Given the immense challenges Rohingya women face to access health and nutrition services, it makes sense to design health and nutrition programs in an integrated way so that comprehensive care can be received at a single delivery spot. Additionally, programs targeting the same demographic of women can benefit through connected referral systems. Reproductive health services like family planning, which might be perceived as more challenging to discuss openly in community settings, can benefit greatly by being integrated into other more accepted health and nutrition services. Planning for integrated services in the midst of an acute emergency response can be challenging, but should be prioritized to ensure that women get the care and quality services that are needed.</p>",

      "title": "Does Advocacy Based Townhall Meeting Increase Women's Recognition of Policy Makers as Visible Supporters of Family Planning in their Communities?",
      "significanceBackground": "<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><p>The Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI), as a family planning (FP) core project since 2009, has covered an impressive mileage in the strategic engagement of policy makers to engender a sustainable supportive environment for increased use of modern FP methods in Nigeria. A key advocacy objective is to achieve increased public support of family planning/childbirth spacing (FP/CBS) by policy and decision makers through public statements and funding of quality FP/CBS services in the communities. The influence of the policy makers, is recognized as a key ideational factor for positive behavioural change, particularly among women who need to use family planning. The expressed support by policy makers convinces the community members that such a leader would also commit to providing the necessary resources required at the facility for quality service provision. Women expect to hear their leaders speaking publicly.</p><p></p><p>Consequently, NURHI 2 initiated a bridge building FP/CBS advocacy based townhall meeting where the policy makers meet their communities to discuss FP/MNCH concerns. The meeting also creates opportunities for policy makers to give account of their performances and stand on FP/CBS. It also gives the community leaders greater opportunity to raise questions and also seek answers from their elected leaders. </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>This strategy is aimed at increasing the proportion of women who hear their policy makers and leaders speak in support of family planning/childbirth spacing. This is tracked through flexitrack surveys. Evidence based data shows that women are increasingly hearing their policy makers speak in favour of family planning in the three NURHI 2 project states, Kaduna, Lagos and Oyo States. Policy makers, particularly the Local Government Chairmen, who hold elective positions are also benefiting from increased visiblity among their communities. The community leaders invariably are empowered as voices for accountability. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A one-day advocacy based town hall meeting is conducted with the participation of the Chairman/Chairperson and his key technocrats, community leaders and women leaders. The meeting is anchored by NURHI 2 with the Advocacy Core Group. Discussions focus on FP/CBS and its benefits of family planning, The Chairmen speak to give account of their performances. The community leaders and members also ask questions seeking answers from the policy makers. The events are covered by the media. The resultant impact is captured using flexitrack surveys to determine the proprtion of women who have heard their policy makers speak in support of family planning.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong> </strong>Results from the NURHI 2 Flexitrack/Omnibus Surveys show that increasing proportions of women hear their policy makers and leaders speaking in support of FP/CBS in the three NURHI 2 Project States. The grapic presentation of the results in the three NURHI 2 project states will be presented at the Conference.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p><strong>Policy and Program Implications: </strong> Advocacy based town hall meetings creates opportunities for visibility for policy makers and elected decision makers among their electorates and communities. It gives them the opportunity to showcase their interests, performance and responsiveness to the people’s needs/demands. It also creates opportunities for voice since the community leaders can also ask questions and seek clarifications on their concerns.  It is an accountability focused mechanism, particularly at the LGA and community levels. It also helps to build relationships among the leaders and the lead and could enhance the confidence women often require to change their behaviours to positively access family planning services; a very important ideational factor. When women hear their policy makers and leaders speak publicly in support of FP/CBS they will be positively inclined to use FP/CBS services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Worldwide, local government authorities have an important role in delivering family planning services. Yet, the situation on the ground reveals low budgets and a lack of downward accountability by local government authorities.</p><p></p><p>Strongly anchored in communities, trusted and respected, faith actors can take an intermediary role in promoting local accountability. Between 69% and 98% of the population in Africa describes religion as “very important” in their lives” (Pew 2010).</p><p></p><p>Faith actors have close relationships with communities, while politicians rely on these same religious constituencies to ensure their election and ongoing legitimacy as political representatives. This gives faith actors a great deal of influence over local political decision-makers and public agenda setting.  Therefore, faith leaders’ understanding and support is paramount for promoting family planning services and information at sub-national level. They need to understand local policy making and monitoring processes, gain the skills to engage effectively with decision makers. Their added value: they mobilize large constituencies, create pressure to prioritize family planning, and can engage in legitimate and constructive dialogue with decision makers.</p><p></p><p>This presentation draws on Faith to Action Network’s advocacy and accountability experience at the sub-national level in Kenya, the Philippines and Uganda.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Between 2015 and 2017, interventions at two levels have achieved notable improvements in family planning budgets and policies:</p><p></p><p>(1) Faith to Action Network has developed policy recommendations, connecting religious texts and medical evidence, and offered trainings on advocacy and communication, as well as small grants to carry out local advocacy.</p><p></p><p>(2) Faith actors have built local coalitions and held dialogues with public officials. Faith leaders have carried out accountability visits, informing community members about their rights and monitoring health facilities. They have disseminated messages in churches, mosques, schools and through radio stations to build a constituency and increase public pressure.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This presentation uses findings from several case studies developed by Faith to Action Network. The purpose of these case studies was to understand the outcomes and pathways of faith actors’ local accountability work, developing recommendations for future action. The case studies make use of quantitative and qualitative data collected from project records and documents, key informant interviews, field visits as well as health management information systems. They assess faith organisations’ advocacy aims, main actors, strategies within the local political context. At the same time, the studies investigate why specific strategies and tactics were chosen, for example choice of message, choice of messenger, choice of target groups. They establish outcomes and impact (direct and indirect, also negative, short term, long term). They seek to identify facilitating and constraining factors, in particular on how actors addressed constraints or difficulties, especially around conflicts of opinion. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The case studies reveal faith actors’ influential role in setting the policy agenda at subnational level and holding local government administrations to account.</p><p> </p><p>Advocacy results: 28 policy and budget changes have been recorded at sub-national levels in Uganda, Kenya and the Philippines. This includes 14 budget increases, development of 3 District Family Planning Costed Implementation Plans, creation of 5 collaboration forums, administrative action to address HR shortages and FP stockouts in public health facilities, establishment of referrals between catholic and public facilities, a bylaw to prevent early marriages and early pregnancies, as well as public consultations to curtail the incidences of transactional sex. </p><p> </p><p>Findings: At local level, faith leaders have big political clout. They are highly trusted personalities, who are respected by politicians, technocrats and ordinary citizens. Their assets comprise their ability to mobilize large numbers of congregants, while owning many communication channels - places of worship, faith-based radio stations, schools, mothers’ unions and youth structures. In the four cases, they have used these assets to create legitimacy and generate urgency for family planning, thus building up public pressure for improved family planning services. Their convening power and resources enable them to constructively engage with local decision makers and stakeholders, offering technical assistance in drafting policies and hosting decision making forums. Finally, in all cases, transnational exchanges between local faith actors and respected religious authorities have significantly strengthened local faith actors’ confidence to take advocacy actions on family planning. </p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>The case studies show that faith actors have a strong positive influence on local government authorities’ provision of family planning services. Their social accountability activities effectively address sub-national policy barriers. Through local advocacy and community engagement family planning budgets have increased; districts FP plans have been developed; working groups formed, services and medical supplies have improved. </p><p> </p><p>Key lessons:</p><p>·        Effectively involving faith actors in sub-national accountability work, requires passionate faith leaders, who can steer the process and provide top-level support. </p><p>·        Using all faith-based communication channels helps set the local agenda: churches, mosques, schools, radio-stations, mothers unions, youth groups.</p><p>·        Integrating family planning messages into theological messages builds legitimacy.</p><p>·        Relationship with faith actors happens through mediators, mostly transnational religious authorities. This strengthens the local faith actor’s confidence that it is doing the right thing. </p><p>·        It involves theological processes and political processes, comprising normative work, civic education, community engagement, technical policy making and monitoring.</p><p>·        The process builds the confidence of religious leaders who gain national clout and visibility.</p><p>·        Faith-driven social accountability is a constructive way to engage communities and local government authorities within shrinking civic spaces. They offer legitimate and locally-owned structures to hold government to account. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Within SRHR policy framework, Africa has developed and adopted a number of treaties and agreements most notably, the Maputo Plan of Action for the Operationalisation of the Continental Policy Framework for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (MPoA) which was adopted in 2006 by African Union Head of States.</p><p>The Maputo Plan of Action places emphasis on the family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) priorities for Africa in the context of achieving regional and international commitments such as the ICPD . It also illustrates the political will within the African continent to provide high quality information and services to women, men, and young people to protect themselves from unwanted and high-risk pregnancies, from sexually transmitted infections and in general to   enhance the individual reproductive health and rights of their people .</p><p>The implementation of the MPoA was reviewed at different levels namely at the regional level by the African UnionCommission (AUC) as well by Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).  The main objective of the review was to determine the extent to which member states have domesticated the MPoA and implemented in their national strategies, plans and programmes to improve the SRHR landscape of the continent.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p></p><p></p><p>When the initial MPoA came to an end in 2015 it became evident that despite commitment of African governments to improve access to SRH services of their people, many countries were  found lagging behind in terms of implementation.</p><p>For example, many African countries had supportive FP protocols and guidelines, but effective implementation to reach all communities in need was lacking.</p><p>In light of the unfinished SRHR agenda, the African Union agreed to extend the MPoA for another 15 years, running concurrently with the new SDGs. A CSO review to determine the initial MPoA was sanctioned by the AU and conducted by IPPF.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Maputo Plan of Action is a continental document therefore, the assessment focused on all the countries of the entire continent of Africa. The advocacy approach was to mobilize CSOs involved in SRHR programmes in all African countries to review the implementation of the MPoA and submit recommendations to the African Union.</p><p>Purposive sampling technique was used for respondents. Purposively CSOs involved in SRHR programmes and has been actively engaged in the Maputo Plan of Action process and implementation was selected to participate in the assessment. A total of 87 CSOs from 37 countries participated in the review.</p><p>Data collection methods used in the review included web-based questionnaire, CSO consultation forums, CSOs review and validation meeting and review of relevant literature and documents related to the Maputo Plan of Action and other regional and international SRHR policy frameworks. Concerning the CSO consultation forums, participants from all parts of Africa participated and the forums were organized in Johannesburg, South Africa; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Nairobi, Kenya and Lusaka, Zambia for selected CSOs from the various sub-regions. The CSOs were selected from countries with levels of performance (High, Medium, Low) related to the implementation of the MPoA.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>71.1% of the CSOs indicated that their countries were aligned or in the process of aligning themselves to MPoA. The proportion of countries that have aligned or are in the process of aligning their national strategy on SRHR and national plan to MPoA was found to be at 72.3 % and 69.8 % respectively. This indicates that African Member States willingness to align their SRHR documents to the Continental Policy Framework .</p><p>The areas of intervention given the highest priority according to CSOs are integration of SRH services in primary healthcare (33.8%), followed by legislation on SRH (25.3%), and youth sexual and reproductive health (13.3%). This was also reported by the participants of the CSOs consultative forum.</p><p>Majority of the CSOs (92.8%), recognize the relevancy of MPoA strategies in meeting the continents’ needs after 2015 and made several recommendations for it to remain relevant. CSOs participating in the consultative forum were also of the same opinion mainly because many issues in the reproductive health are yet to be addressed.</p><p>The findings illustrated that a number of countries have developed roadmaps for maternal and new-born health, made significant progress in scaling up linkages between SRH and HIV/AIDS, passed new laws to protect women against violence and criminalized harmful practices against women and expanded family planning programming. It was noted that many of the key policies forming the foundation for action for the Maputo Plan of Action were in place at the country level, however, progress on implementation varied between countries.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>In terms of family planning, the MPoA has enabled repositioning FP as an essential part of the attainment of health MDGs. For example in Ghana the MPoA gave impetus to revise the  National Insurance System (NHIS) Policy to  include FP service; in Tanzania  the Ministry of Health issued a directive to the Local Government Authorities (LGA) to budget for FP and  dictated the minimum package of FP services that must be budgeted for by LGA.; in Togo Community level service delivery for FP did not include provision of injectable FP by community health workers, following advocacy initiatives the legislation was reviewed to be able to provide injectable FP. Nevertheless, despite  the fact that FP among others was a proven intervention for reducing maternal deaths,  CSO’s  also noted that the use of family planning services remained low in Africa. The necessity to extend the MPoA was highlighted and with regards to FP recommended the prioritization of   (i) access to full range of acceptable, affordable, safe, effective and high-quality contraceptives, (ii)  the removal of existing barriers, including requirements for spousal and parental consent, to women and young people to gain access to family planning, and (iii) allocate health budget to family planning and address all demand and supply oriented barriers of access to, and use of family planning. The advocacy initiative to extend the MPoA has enabled a comprehensive review of the MPoA. This contributed to the final review of the MPoA presented by the AUC and the adoption by AU Heads</p>",

      "title": "Lessons learned from the UN Commission on Life Saving Commodities (UNCoLSC) and RMNCH Trust Fund partnership model which aimed to help accelerate the reduction of maternal and newborn deaths in 19 high burden countries in sub Saharan Africa and Asia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In 2012, at the London Summit on Family Planning, a global commitment was made to expand access to modern contraceptives and family planning information and services by 2020 to 120 million women and girls in the world’s poorest countries. The target was to avert 110 million unintended pregnancies, 200,000 women dying in pregnancy and childbirth, and nearly three million babies dying in their first year of life. The summit set into action a series of events including; the launch of the Family Planning 2020 initiative, and the UN Commission on Life Saving Commodities (UNCoLSC) which provided a framework for expanding availability and access to 13 commodities including implantable contraceptives. The RMNCH Trust Fund (TF) was also established in 2012 as a multi UN agency initiative (UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO), which aimed to finance high impact, priority interventions on reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health, in order to accelerate the reduction of maternal and child deaths. An estimated US$250 million of the RMNCH Trust Fund, was funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Government of Norway.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The RMNCH Trust Fund established a network of Technical Resource Teams (TRT) including; a family planning, advocacy and market shaping TRTs, which were a consortia of experts to facilitate global-level action while simultaneously supporting country implementation. Furthermore, a Country Engagement Process in 19 supported countries was undertaken to prioritize RMNCH interventions, align financing streams against these priorities, and provide direct financing to country plans through the RMNCH Trust Fund. Direct technical and financial support was provided to 19 EWEC countries, and TRTs of more than 450 partners who comprised this effort. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p><em>An evaluation was conducted to assess the impact of the RMNCH Trust Fund work in the supported countries. The evaluation utilised a contribution analysis approach and the OECD DAC criteria for assessing the impact of development aid. Primary and secondary data was gathered to test and validate the ToC, using qualitative methods. The evaluation team reviewed financial and programme data and gathered data on key RMNCH indicators, to determine trends in RMNC in the countries. Data collection methods included a comprehensive review of documents, an online survey and field visits to selected countries to interview key informants and, where feasible, discuss with representatives of community groups and visit health facilities. One of the limitations is that the evaluation was based primarily on qualitative data. Because of the short duration of activities at the country level (some only 6-18 months), quantitative data on improvements was limited. Despite the limitations, the range of evidence gathered, triangulated across different sources and data collection methods indicate the evaluation was able to report findings with a reasonable degree of confidence.</em></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><em>The evaluation revealed that the RMNCH Trust Fund led to the inclusion of interventions to increase access to, and use of, underutilized life-saving commodities in national plans, and supported prioritized RMNCH activities not funded or addressed by either domestic or international resources. About $30m (15%) of the RMNCH Trust Fund budget, financed interventions to expand access to and utilization of family planning interventions. The Trust Fund facilitated substantial price reduction agreements for family planning commodities which helped dramatically increase the global availability and affordability. The RMNCH Trust Fund was also critical in providing support to the registration of life saving commodities including FP commodities, provision of technical guidelines, supply chain strengthening, health worker training and demand generation efforts. The Trust Fund established effective and streamlined processes and procedures, bringing partners together to integrate initiatives that often operate as silos. The formation of the TRTs established new channels of communication among global experts. The RMNCH country engagement process successfully established government ownership, although results differed by country. Alignment worked best when heads of host country development ministries and staff from different line departments involved in planning were also responsible for implementation. Resource gap analysis increased awareness of gaps and “financial fragmentation”. Lastly, the Trust Fund supported activities provided a foundation on which sustainable change can be built and expansion possible. However, the insufficient sustainability plans, coupled with the short duration of several of the grants and inadequate follow-on financing, put the sustainability of the Trust Fund achievements at high risk.</em></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p><em>Global and country-level experience on the RMNCH Trust Fund, have the potential to inform the ambitious effort on the post-2015 SDG agenda and the updated Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescent’s Health. These are lessons learnt of a broad coordinated global and country action to alleviate persistence bottlenecks on access to life saving commodities and improve RMNCH outcomes. The RMNCH Trust Fund experience also provides lessons learnt of advocacy at a high level translating into action, and on the need to link support with country demand, and also highlights the unfinished agenda on life saving commodities.  </em></p>",

      "title": "New Game Plan! Health and Family Planning Advocacy Post- Devolution. ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The 2010 Constitution established a devolved system of governance which put in place two levels of government: national and county. The creation of 47 counties served to transfer functions, resources, power and responsibilities from the central government to decentralized units, effectively bringing government ‘closer to the people’ and allowing for participatory decision-making.</p><p>The four tiers within the health service sector (community, primary care, county and national) offer new opportunities for grassroots engagement and budget and policy influence. Devolution enables focused, tailored advocacy at every level - with diverse approaches and strategies and targets for each, yielding rich solutions and outcomes. Yet the rapid rollout of the tiered health structures revealed capacity gaps, human resource deficiencies, a lack of critical legal and institutional infrastructure, rampant corruption and a conflicting relationship with the national government.</p><p>Grassroots advocates’ responsibilities and potential impact are expanding as they work from the foundation of the devolved infrastructure upwards, and influence health decision-making and priority-setting. Advocates simultaneously face challenges related to the multiplicity of actors who need to be influenced, evolving and unclear processes at the different levels, increased bureaucracy, and an increased work load due to the need to work across all levels.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Numerous organizations have re-focused their advocacy efforts from a purely national focus to allow for a synergistic dual approach that addresses decision-makers, duty bearers and other stakeholders at the national and county level concurrently. Advocates have recalibrated their approach to optimize the influencing opportunities, with most working at a minimum of two out of the four (community, primary care, county and national) tiers.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Research to synthesize findings on the impact of devolution on advocacy practice in Kenya is being undertaken by the Advocacy Accelerator and will be finalized in September 2018. A mixed method approach that includes i) focus group discussions with six organizations working on Family Planning Advocacy in Kenya, ii) key informant interviews with county officials with responsibilities for budget processes related to family planning and SRH and, iii) a survey of 12 organizations undertaking family planning advocacy in Kenya.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Early findings indicate that organizations have had to re-strategize and to develop new theories of change to be effective in their advocacy work under the devolved governance arrangements. The implications of these new arrangements on strategy, staffing and level of effort at various levels but particularly at county and national levels will be presented, together with the challenges and opportunities that arise from this adjusted way of working. We will also analyze and present emerging trends and best practices in advocacy to inform future interventions.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Today, county governments have significant influence in determining the sexual reproductive and health outcomes of the populations living within their county. A centralized national government no longer holds the balance of power to take almost all decisions but it remains an important player as a regulator and standard-setter and policy-maker. The government retains an important role in setting the tone for the prioritization and the promotion of family planning as a means of securing broader development objectives. The new way of doing business requires advocates to work simultaneously at different levels. This has implications for advocacy budgets and working modalities and affects how civil society advocacy organizations invest their financial and human resources. It is important that stakeholders including government (at all levels) and donors who fund advocacy understand these developments and consider these shifts.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The rate of unplanned pregnancies among adolescents in Kenya remains high at 18.1% while that of Mombasa County stands at 16.6%;most attributed to limited access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services targeting adolescents. The National Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health Policy (ASRH) of 2015 aims to provide a policy framework towards an enhanced SRH status of adolescents in Kenya. In addition, the National Guidelines for Provision of Sexual Reproductive Health Services of 2005 aims to provide a policy framework towards enhanced comprehensive SRH provision of services to adolescents and young people.</p><p>Objectives: Building capacities of adolescents and young people (10-24 years) in advocacy to influence policies and budgets that affect their SRH needs.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Youth and adolescents champions from within Mombasa county have been able to mobilise themselves in advocating for implemenation of the existing documents through an innovative approach. We have been able to push for finance allocation in the financial year budgets at county level. The champions involves themselves on policy development at county level for instance they have and still are participating in County Intergrated Development Plans (CIDP) and Costed Implementation Plans-Family Planning to include adolescents and young peoples agends in that important document.</p><p>This documents and budget supports in financing youth friendly centres hence contributing to implementation of the policies.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>DSW-Kenya trained and worked with youth champions within Mombasa county in a project dubbed \"SHAPE\" (Securing Health Advocacy through Peoples Empowerment) whose aim was to advocate for allocations of more resources for family planning in Mombasa county budgets. The role of the champions was to meet with policy makers, stakeholders in order to advocate, create demand for them to increase more financial resources within the budgets. The youth champions came from different grassroots youth serving organizations.</p><p>The project held 4 stakeholders consultative forums during projects implementation period July 2016-November 2017 between the youth champions, county assembly, law enforcement officials, healthcare providers and community members looked at the ASRH policy implementation.</p><p>Stretchers Youth Organization stepped down policy and budget advocacy training to other youth organizations and young people in the county to increase the network of youth advocates championing on FP agenda. SYO mobilized and organized grassroots organizations in drafting memos to be submitted during public participation forums and meetings with policy makers.</p><p>The organization and youth champions submitted 5 memorandum of understandings during the projects period to the county government addressing adolescents and young peoples issues.</p><p>We have had meetings to formulate the first ever Costed Implementation Plan-Family Planning in Mombasa County.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Services providers, decision makers and policy makers acknowledge challenges in implementing the ASRH policy and National Guidelines for Provision of YFS services. They acknowledge that; lack of financial resources in supporting the policies is one of the major factors of there lack and slow implemenataions. They acknowledge that without funds then implementation becomes a challenge.</p><p>Nevertheless, through the submissions of 5 memorandums of understandings, we saw an increment of financial budgeting in financial year 2017/2018 at county level for family planning at 111.9 M Kenyan Shillings from 90.8M Kes in 2016/2017 and 77.1M Kes in 2015/2016 financial year. The 111.9M Kes represented 3.6% of the total Health budget allocated. We have also noted the issues addressed in the memorandums submitted have been taken into considerations in the County Intergrated Development Plans (CIDP) 2018-2023, for instance, adolescents health programming has been captured in the CIDP 2018-2023 and Comprehensive Sex Education in schools has been acknowledged in the document also.</p><p>The County developed its first ever CIP-FP (2018-2023) for Mombasa County.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>With contraceptive implant demand growing rapidly in Uganda (currently at 16% of the method mix[1]), so too does demand for implant removal services. Emerging regional data demonstrate that 4-7% of implant users are unable to have their implant removed when desired[2]. Under the 2-year Best Practices in Implant Removal project, Jhpiego and MOH supported 48 facilities in 6 districts to build provider capacity and equip facilities with materials and processes necessary to ensure clients seeking removal could be served, on-demand, with quality removal services. While most project interventions were successful in improving readiness to offer quality implant removal services, providers faced persistent challenges due to lack of adequate consumables and supplies for the procedure. Startlingly, at baseline only 8% of LARC facilities had the necessary consumables and equipment for removal <em>even though they were all actively providing LARC services</em>. Despite the project availing equipment to each, only 29% had the necessary supplies at project endline due to product loss, lack of consumable resupply, and inadequate equipment processing. Thus, the project held an advocacy workshop to address this intractable problem limiting the provision of key health services.</p> <p>[1] PMA Round 3</p><p>[2] PMA Special Reports in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Ethiopia</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Using Advance Family Planning’s SMART Advocacy approach, Jhpiego convened ~20 key family planning stakeholders with deep knowledge of the equipment and consumable shortages issue, representing national, district, and facility expertise. The Jhpiego team facilitated a three-day workshop which engaged participants in the development of a short-tern advocacy strategy. Two objectives were identified that if achieved, would contribute to resolving the equipment and consumables challenge:</p>\t<li>Include implant insertion and removal equipment in the GFF RMNCAH equipment procurement plan by June 2018.</li>\t<li>Develop a three-year Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan [CIP] (2018-2020) for Ntungamo District by February 2018.</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>Using the nine-step process for facilitating and implementing a targeted FP advocacy strategy, participants conducted a decision-maker analysis and subsequently developed key messages and a plan for implementation of the advocacy strategy.</p><p></p><p>To include required implant equipment into the national GFF RMNCAH equipment procurement plan, specific members of the MOH planning committee and senior leadership who would inevitably sign-off on the procurement plan were targeted with key messages. These messages were supported with Jhpiego’s project data and quantifications conducted by supply chain experts. Messages were framed around the consumable and equipment shortage as a threat to achieving national FP2020 goals and the many investments in supply chain and service delivery made to date.</p><p></p><p>To advance the Ntungamo District CIP objective, a strategic messenger approached the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) with well-crafted arguments about the impact of meeting FP demand on overall district development goals (his primary interest). From this, the CAO accepted the creation of a district-led CIP working group to develop the strategy. During CIP development, advocates demonstrated the need to include a budget line item on for equipping facilities with FP equipment and consumables into the CIP, costed-out for coverage at all government facilities in the district.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>As a result of this advocacy:</p><ul>\t<li>In February 2018, Uganda’s national GFF Procurement Planning committee adopted the addition of implant and IUD insertion and removal equipment into their procurement plan. The instruments and consumables are currently in the procurement process, with the tender appearing in papers at the time of this abstract submission. The equipment and consumables for procurement are of sufficient quantity necessary for <em>national coverage</em> for IUD and implant services in the nation’s nearly 3000 public facilities and hospitals, and total over <strong>2 Million USD</strong> in product.</li>\t<li>In March 2018, Ntungamo District officially adopted a district CIP for Family Planning. The CIP included budget line items for the equipment and consumables required for family planning service provision and autoclaves, as well as refresher courses for healthcare providers in conducting implant removals. Additionally, the District Council committed to fund 10% of the total CIP cost of 24.9M UGX, a contribution equivalent to <strong>$6,800 USD</strong>.</li></ul>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>This effort demonstrates how deployment of strategic advocacy can be utilized for overcoming previously intractable challenges in service delivery. The challenge of consumable and equipment shortages is not new, nor is it exclusively one faced in family planning, and yet solutions at scale on this topic are largely undocumented and unknown[1]. Specific to implant removal, lack of equipment and consumables can have profound consequences in our pursuit of ensuring rights and choice—without these materials, providers are forced to either forge onwards without the adequate supplies thereby compromising the client’s safety, or delay or deny this service. For example, program data under this same project implemented in Kenya showed that after achieving clinical competency in implant removal, providers referring clients for removal elsewhere were doing so because of lack of adequate supplies– it was the single cause of 2/3 of the referrals taking place. And while national procurement of LARC equipment and consumables and CIP budget lines for purchasing and distribution of supplies is not the <em>complete</em> answer to this challenge, it certainly moves us closer to closing the gap to ensuring clients seeking removal can be served, on-demand, with quality removal services. Additionally, this effort also serves as an example of advocates successfully leveraging the GFF and subnational CIPs to mobilize resources for underfinanced areas.</p> <p>[1] Consultation with Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition members, March 2018.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Thirty-five percent of Uganda’s population are young people aged 10 to 24 years old. Twenty-five percent of the girls below 20 years are either pregnant or have given birth, according to the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey 2016. As per the Uganda's Ministry of Education and Sports 2016 data, only 36% of sexually active school going girls, below 18 years, have ever used contraceptives . Additionally, the statistics show that of the 30% of in-school girls who are sexually active, over 80% become pregnant. Of these that conceive, more than 95% dropped out of school because of pregnancy. In Uganda young people become sexually active, marry, and bear children early in life. Yet at the national level, policymakers seem to be out of touch with these realities. For example, in 2016 they suspended teaching sexuality education in schools. In 2017, the government halted the launch of the Sexual and Reprodutive Health and Rights (SRHR) Guidelines and Service Standards, partly because of the clause granting access to contraceptives for all sexually active women of reproductive age(15 – 49) without seeking permission from their parents or partner.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Reproductive Health Uganda (RHU), with support from the Advance Family Planning initiative, is working to improve youth access to family planning. In collaboration with district health officers of Bushenyi and Mbarara districts, RHU integrated use of innovative social accountability tools with the ground-tested AFP SMART advocacy approach, while strengthening the capacity of young people to lead the advocacy efforts. The initiative aimed to support young people to understand and exercise their rights to hold duty bearers accountable for youth-friendly services (YFS); to increase access to YFS, including family planning; and to assess opportunities and barriers to youth participation in decision-making.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In September 2017, RHU trained 20 young people in Bushenyi (10) and Mbarara (10) districts on social accountability and their health rights and responsibilities. The young people were equipped with skills on how to use the social accountability tools—including RHU’s adapted the Care International Community Score Card. The score card empowers communities to participate in providing essential information and constructive feedback. After the training, the youth participants visited seven health facilities in Bushenyi (October) and Mbarara (September) to interview other young people and community members. Using the score card, the young facilitators assessed youth access to FP/SRH services, based on a scale of 1 to 5 (very bad; bad; fair; good; and very good). With the evidence from the score card, in October 2017, RHU facilitated an AFP SMART strategy session for the young people from Bushenyi and Mbarara districts. During the session RHU facilitated for the Mbarara and Bushenyi youth, they used the findings/issues from the score card to develop SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) advocacy objectives and strategies. The young people presented the advocacy asks to their respective district councils – in October 2017 for Mbarara and December 2017 for Bushenyi.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The young people focused on two specific advocacy asks: 1. To Allocate specific time for provision of YFS at all district health centres and 2. To create a budget line and allocate funds for YFS in the health sector budget. In Bushenyi, the district council issued directives for all sectors to create a budget line and commit 1% of their budget to provision of YFS effective the next financial year 2018/19. Although it seems small, this first-time commitment can amount to $1,000 or more per sub-county. The council also agreed to dedicate Thursdays every week for provision of YFS at all health centers in Bushenyi by January 2018. One youth center (Kyeizooba) in the piloted sites is already fully functional; an additional eight are expected to be open by November 2018. The district also identified a young person to represent young people on each of the health unit management committees Mbarara had similar success: the district chief administrative officer issued a directive to all health facilities to dedicate a specific day to provide YFS. The District Technical Planning Committee endorsed the creation of specific times for provision of YFS, including family planning. The committee referred the issue of creating a budget line for YFS in the district’s health sector budget to the next district council meeting, though allocations had not yet been done.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p> This is the first time social accountability and AFP SMART advocacy were integrated for youth friendly services, and it has yielded results.  The achievements resulted in continued engagement of communities to increase awareness about adolescent health needs and strengthened the delivery of services in communities, especially after the inclusion of young people in the health unit management committees.  Community scorecards provided an excellent alternative to other methodologies of social accountability, especially in areas with low literacy levels, for communities to provide feedback.  Both community score card and AFP SMART advocacy strategy proved effective in engaging the local leaders and reinforce their role in prioritizing resources to meet local population needs.  Budget allocations for youth friendly services lead to local ownership and sustainability.  It was critical to let the young people decide and develop their own objectives- RHU’s role was only to facilitate the process.  Resources permitting, it’s ideal to work with more young people—even more than 10 per district. This leaves more young advocates in the district, and allows for a continued pool to work with, even when some of them move on (for different reasons including school).  Working with youth representatives to the district council from the start makes the process easier because they are knowledgeable about the technicalities of decision making during council deliberations.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Dans un contexte de mortalité maternelle préoccupante, de faible prévalence contraceptive moderne (21% en 2014 selon le MICS) et de besoins non-satisfaits en planification familiale en constante augmentation, le Cameroun a élaboré en 2014 une stratégie de promotion des méthodes contraceptives en générale, et celles de longue durée d’action (MLDA) en particulier dans laquelle, le prestataire est un levier important de l’adoption par les femmes en âge de procréer (FAP).</p><p>En soutien à cette stratégie, le Programme d’Accès aux Services de la Santé de Reproduction (PAS-SR), un projet de coopération bilatérale entre le Cameroun et l’Allemagne, est mis en œuvre dans les régions à faible prévalence contraceptive, dans le but de contribuer à infléchir la tendance de la mortalité maternelle. Les MLDA comme le DIU et l’Implant étant des méthodes très efficaces, mais délicates dans la manipulation, le projet s’appuie entre autres sur l’information, la communication et l’éducation des prestataires pour accroitre le taux d’utilisation de celles-ci. Seulement, à ce jour peu d’études se sont intéressées au comportement des prestataires vis-à-vis de ces méthodes en général et du DIU en particulier dans les zones d’intervention du programme.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>La présente recherche se propose de répondre à la question de savoir quelles sont les perceptions et/ou connaissances des prestataires vis-à-vis du DIU, qui peuvent influencer l’adoption de cette méthode par les FAP?</p><p>Pour répondre à cette question, on pourrait supposer que les caractéristiques sociodémographiques du prestataire, ses perceptions, son niveau de connaissances vis-à-vis des caractéristiques du DIU pourraient influencer sa disposition à faciliter son adoption par une FAP.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Une étude quantitative transversale de base a été menée sur un échantillon représentatif de 322 prestataires des formations sanitaires publiques et privées, franchisées et non franchisées des zones d’intervention du projet (Est, Adamaoua, Nord et Extrême-Nord), sur la base d’un questionnaire pré-codé standardisé. </p><p>Les données saisies en double, ont été analysées avec le logiciel Stata 14, par la production des fréquences simples, des tableaux croisés et les tests de Khi-deux, pour déterminer le caractère significatif ou non du niveau de différence observé pour certains indicateurs. Par ailleurs, le modèle Logit binaire a permis d’identifier les facteurs de comportement statistiquement significatifs.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Il ressort de manière globale que, les connaissances des prestataires vis-à-vis du DIU demeurent faibles et significativement plus faibles chez les prestataires Non ProFam® (P=0.00). Selon les prestataires, les principales raisons qui les amèneraient à recommander le DIU sont le fait que ce soit une méthode de longue durée (80%), une méthode contraceptive sûre (71%), abordable pour les clientes (64%) et ne présentant pas beaucoup d’effets secondaires (59%). Le fait que la femme ait plusieurs partenaires sexuels (55%), qu’elle soit jeune (53%), qu’elle n’ait pas un accès aisé aux soins de suivi (52%) ou qu’elle soit nullipare (50%) ont été évoqués comme des éléments pouvant les amener à ne pas recommander le DIU. Il en est de même du manque d’équipement adéquat (19%), des ruptures de stocks (16%), du besoin en formation (15%), etc...</p><p>Les résultats du modèle Logit binaire montrent que l’appartenance au réseau ProFam®, le fait d’être un homme, la supervision, la participation aux campagnes d’insertion gratuite du DIU et l’expérience en insertion du DIU sont les facteurs favorisant l’administration du DIU par les prestataires. L’âge par contre est inversement lié à la recommandation/administration du DIU par le prestataire. Autrement dit, les prestataires les plus âgés auraient tendance à ne pas recommander/administrer le DIU aux clientes.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Les résultats de cette étude de base montrent que l’appartenance au réseau ProFam® présente une valeur ajoutée, même si dans l’ensemble, le niveau de connaissances des prestataires vis-à-vis du DIU reste relativement faible. A cela s’ajoutent des attitudes défavorables à la recommandation/administration du DIU aux clientes, parfois justifiées par des raisons non-médicales. Ce qui témoigne de la nécessité de former davantage les prestataires (formation initiale en planification familiale complète pour certains et formation continue pour tous) et de les suivre afin de renforcer leur efficacité.</p><p>Le fait que l’appartenance au réseau ProFam®, la supervision et la participation aux campagnes d’insertion gratuite du DIU soient significativement et positivement liées à la recommandation/administration du DIU suggère qu’il faut poursuivre les efforts d’intégration des formations sanitaires dans le réseau ProFam® et y mettre en œuvre le package d’activités de développement des compétences des prestataires telles que la formation, le suivi post formation, la supervision, etc. Par ailleurs, il est indispensable d’organiser à des occasions bien choisies, des campagnes au cours desquelles les méthodes contraceptives sont fournies gratuitement aux clientes.</p>",

      "title": "Analyse des barrières à l'offre de service et étude de la déviance positive en Côte d’Ivoire, une initiative du projet Transform/PHARE",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>La Côte d’Ivoire, comme bien d’autres pays membres du partenariat de Ouagadougou, a décidé de revitaliser son programme national de planification familiale (PF) avec pour objectifs de (i) passer de 18% à 36% de prévalence contraceptive d’ici 20201 et (ii) contribuer à environ 25% (soit 514 000 nouvelles utilisatrices) à la cible sous régionale de 2,2 millions d’utilisatrices additionnelles de 2015 à 20202.  Cependant plusieurs aspects dont la communication pour le changement social et de comportement (CCSC), l’approvisionnement en produits contraceptifs, le suivi et évaluation des activités de PF ainsi que l’offre des services sont à améliorer. C’est dans cette optique que PSI – Côte d’Ivoire, dans l’exécution du projet Transform/PHARE financé par l’USAID, a exploré les barrières et obstacles à l’offre de services de planification familiale (PF) que présentent les prestataires au niveau opérationnel. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Les objectifs étaient d’identifier les facteurs qui influencent négativement l’offre de services de PF de qualité au niveau des prestataires et collecter les meilleures pratiques auprès de quelques prestataires jugés « déviants positifs » afin d’améliorer les stratégies de communication et/ou outils de communication pour le changement de comportement axé sur les prestataires de services en Côte d’Ivoire.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>L’étude qualitative a utilisé une méthodologie mixte partant de la revue de la littérature jusqu’aux entretiens individuels et de groupes. Dans un premier temps, une revue de la littérature sur les barrières liées à l'offre des services de PF en Afrique de l'ouest suivie de 15 groupes de discussions avec 107 prestataires dans 6 régions en Côte d'Ivoire. Ensuite, une enquête clients-mystères par 10 clientes d’une sélection de 30 prestataires sur les 107 correspondant aux critères optimaux de déviance positive, et enfin une série d’entretiens individuels approfondis avec 15 prestataires jugés « déviants positifs » afin d’identifier les meilleures pratiques. Cette collecte a été effectuée en 2016.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Lors de la recherche, 3 types de barrières à l’offre de services de PF ont été identifiés et classifiés selon le modèle socio-écologique : les barrières organisationnelles liées entre autres à l’insuffisance et l’inadéquation de la formation et du recyclage des prestataires en milieu clinique, et à l’approvisionnement irrégulier en produits de PF. Les barrières communautaires en rapport avec les normes sociales, religieuses et la dynamique du genre qui limitent la prescription de produits PF à certaines catégories des utilisatrices. Les barrières personnelles (individuelles et interpersonnelles) relevant des attitudes, motivations et croyances des prestataires et accentuant ainsi la perception erronée de la PF.</p><p>Les prestataires « déviants positifs » se distinguent par la qualité des services qu’ils offrent surtout sur les éléments tels que l’accueil, la confidentialité, l’écoute des clients/counseling efficace et par leur disponibilité.</p><p>Les éléments qui permettent aux prestataires « déviants positifs » de surmonter les barrières sont la motivation (l’amour du métier), les expériences professionnelles exceptionnelles vécues liées à l’impact positif de la PF sur la vie de certaines clientes ainsi que les effets négatifs du manque de produits ou de service adéquat, mais surtout le renforcement continu de leurs capacités à travers des formations et supervisions régulières.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p><strong>Contribution</strong></p><p>Cette recherche a permis d’analyser les facteurs qui influencent l ‘offre de service de PF par les prestataires de santé afin de révéler les difficultés selon leur perspective. L’analyse de la déviance positive dans ce contexte a identifié les meilleures pratiques et comportement qui ont servi de base pour développer de nouveaux CCSC axé sur les prestataires appropriés tel qu’une mini vidéo et des brise glaces utilisés pendant les formations.</p><p></p><p><strong>Implication</strong></p><p>Les barrières identifiées montrent une interdépendance, les programmes de SBC doivent approcher le système de façon holistique. Le faible renforcement de capacité des prestataires au niveau organisationnel a une influence directe sur la motivation des prestataires au niveau communautaire. Le facteur premier habilitant les prestataires à se dépasser est la formation. Ainsi les programmes de SBC/PF devraient envisager le plaidoyer pour renforcement de capacité à plusieurs niveaux : avant la sortie des écoles de formation, sur le lieu d’exercice/ sessions innovantes qui intéressent tout le personnel, enfin à travers l'institutionnalisation des formations continues/EPU dans un souci de pérennisation. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Medical students are soon to be professionals at the frontline of the health service delivery. In many countries medical school curricula do not include comprehensively the topic of sexual and reproductive health and rights, family planning and contraception or the knowledge provided is being fragmentated. Depending on the setting the teaching might be biased, include misconceptions or outdated information and depend on sociocultural and religious rules or influenced by current legal and political situation at the country level.</p><p>If medical students are not trained and taught during classes and clinics at their medical schools about the contraceptive methods, including long-acting contraception and emergency contraception, they can present prejudice, abstention or objection towards service provision that would affect service coverage. </p><p>There is a huge need for future medical professionals to be fully equipped with the knowledge to provide non-judgmental family planning and person-centered sexual and reproductive healthcare services including counselling. Medical schools should be the place where these values grow for future medical doctors before they go into practice.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What is the state of knowledge, attitudes and practices about family planning, long-acting contraception (LARC), emergency contraception (EC) and counselling of final year medical students around the world?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Our research is a cross-sectional analytical study based on the results of the on-line self-administered questionnaire distributed among students working in national teams of International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations (IFMSA). The data collection was coordinated by country focal points of IFMSA National Member Organizations (NMOs), who were working with medical students at the national and local chapters and distributed the questionnaire among final year medical students in their respective countries from March to September 2016. Collected data was then cleared, stratified per country and region and statistical analyses were carried with STATA 15.</p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We have analyzed responses from 942 medical students from 27 countries (Poland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, UAE, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, India, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Indonesia) from 5 Regions (Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean Region and Americas). 89,5% of medical students reported being taught about family planning in medical school, most of them (83,6%) during Obstetrics and Gynecology classes. However, when asked to rate their satisfaction on their education on contraception, sexual health and counselling students have rated it 5,81, 5,23, 5,07, on the 1-10 scale, respectively. 22,7% states that they have not had been taught about counselling during the medical school classes.</p><p>Many misconceptions were identified when students were asked about knowledge on particular long-acting contraception methods: significant proportion of students did not acknowledged the use of LARCs as post-partum family planning method or the safety of use of LARCs among adolescents and young people and people living with HIV.</p><p>The most important identified barriers that prevent people from access to contraception were lack of comprehensive sexuality education, sociocultural context and religious norms. One in five of the students has acknowledged the bias among healthcare professionals, when asked to identify barriers to adequate service provision.</p><p>Moreover, almost all are taught at medical university about emergency contraception, however 14,6% would not be willing to recommend this method to their future clients.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results of our survey have demonstrated significant gaps in knowledge among medical students about long-acting contraceptives, emergency contraception and preparedness to counselling, no matter where they are from. Many expressed discontent and dissatisfaction with their medical education on family planning and counselling as well as prejudices towards family planning provision. This can be alarming, as final year medical students are soon to be professionals, who are crucial in terms of ensuring the adequate family planning service delivery especially those methods which require the intervention of medical providers.</p><p>The gaps in medical curricula and disparities between the countries in knowledge, attitude and practices affected by personal misconceptions need to be addressed early in training in order to avoid bias later in medical practice.</p><p>Further studies are needed to analyze medical school curricula in context of the quality of information given to medical students are updated and in line with international standards and guidelines equipping medical students with the knowledge and skills needed in order to provide the highest quality non-judgemental family planning services. </p>",

      "title": "Possible intervention points of offering LARC/PM for improving low acceptance of post-partum family planning (PPFP) among mothers delivering at facilities in Bangladesh",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Bangladesh, contraceptive prevalence rate is high, at 62%, but use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC; IUD and implant) and permanent method (PM; female sterilization) is only 7% (BDHS, 2014).  Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Health, Population and Nutrition Sector Program (HPNSP-2017-2022) intended to increase contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) from 62.4 to 75% and LARC/ PM use to 20% of the method mix and thereby reducing Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) by 2022.This suggests that to increase contraceptive acceptance rate (CAR) it is immensely needed to extend the access to family planning services especially LARC/PM to women. In that case post partum family planning (PPFP) can be an effective option to increase the rate of LARC/PM. A global resurgence of interest on antenatal care (ANC) has created an opportunity to offer women about family planning, especially about post- partum family planning (PPFP). On the other hand, with the remarkable increase in facility delivery in Bangladesh, currently at 47%, offering IUD, implant, and female sterilization at delivery could be good options to increase the use of LARC/PM. Therefore, we examine possible intervention points of offering LARC/PM for improving low acceptance of post-partum family planning (PPFP) among mothers delivering at facilities.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We hypothesize that during facility delivery acceptance of PP-LARC/PM is higher among mothers who were told about PP-LARC/PM at different stages of pregnancy e.g. during ANC, during delivery period, and both during ANC and during delivery period. We examine the association between the outcome- mothers’ acceptance of PP-LARC/PM during facility delivery and the exposures: 1) mothers were told/offered about PP-LARC/PM during ANC 2) mothers were told/offered about PP-LARC/PM during delivery period and 3) mothers were told/offered about PP-LARC/PM both during ANC and during delivery period. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p><em>Study design:</em> This cross-sectional study employed a quantitative survey design.</p><p><em>Timeframe and location: </em>The household survey was conducted during April–July 2017 in the 46 study districts in Bangladesh.</p><p><em>Data source and sample size:</em> Sample of this study comes from a household survey of mothers who delivered at facilities during January 2014 to July 2017. All CMWRA ages 13– 49 who were usual residents in each selected household were eligible for the interview. Having 96% response rate we found  10,696 CMWRA and among them 1454 mothers’ youngest child was born in 2014 or later in facilities (public, private and NGO sector) either normal delivery or C-section. </p><p><em>Analysis approach:</em> Data analysis was done in STATA 14.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We find that only 14% of mothers (N=203 out of 1454), who delivered their youngest child at facilities, were offered PP- LARC/PM (IUD or female sterilization) during delivery period. Among them, 22% accepted the methods (Fisher exact test statistic value is &lt; 0.00001; p &lt; .05.  On the other hand, only 4% of mothers (N=57 out of 1454), who delivered their youngest child at facilities, were offered PP- LARC/PM (IUD or female sterilization) both during ANC and during delivery period. Among them, 21% accepted the methods. (Fisher exact test statistic value is &lt; 0.00001; p &lt; .05). Whereas, only 8 % of mothers (N=112 out of 1454), who delivered their youngest child at facilities during January 2014 to July 2017  ,were told regarding PP- LARC/PM (IUD or female sterilization) during ANC visit and among them, only 13% accepted the methods. (Fisher exact test statistic value is &lt; 0.00001; p &lt; .05).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Inadequate offering of LARC/PM to mothers from ANC to facility delivery posed as a major challenge for the low acceptance of PPFP among mothers delivering at facilities. We find that acceptance of PP-LARC/PM is 9 percentage point higher among the mothers who  were offered PP- LARC/PM (IUD or female sterilization) during delivery period than  the mothers who  were offered PP- LARC/PM (IUD or female sterilization) during ANC. So offering LARC/PM during delivery can be more effective to increase the acceptance of post-partum family planning (PPFP) among mothers delivering at facilities in Bangladesh. Therefore, counselling is recommended throughout the stay in the facility, including admission, early labour, delivery room, maternity ward, immediate postpartum and pre-discharge on the importance of family planning and available contraceptive method options. Effective advocacy with the service providers will help to increase postpartum IUD, implant, and female sterilization in Bangladesh.</p>",

      "title": "Value Clarification and Attitudinal Transformation (VCAT) - An Approach to Overcoming Barriers in Family Planning Provision in Conservative Contexts (A Case Study from Pakistan",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Sustainable Development Goals include ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, family planning (FP) information, education and services, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programs. In Pakistan, however, the socio-cultural determinants of these targets, especially those related to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), are often ignored due to personal biases and stigma associated with openly discussing and addressing such issues.</p><p>Studies in Pakistan reveal that while providing services related to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and FP, healthcare providers feel discomfort thus limiting their communication and efficacy to prevent unwanted pregnancies. This has not only resulted in a lack of information among healthcare consumers but also among providers who tend to shy away from discussions concerning sexuality and FP because they feel ill-equipped to manage their personal biases from interfering with their medical practice. However, it has been noted that knowledge alone doesn’t resolve the discomfort HCPs experience while addressing SRH issues, nor does it adequately address judgmental behavior. Alternatively, studies have proven that addressing foundational attitudes through approaches such as ‘Value Clarification and Attitudinal Transformation (VCAT)’ greatly support in overcoming provider barriers and stigma related to SRH.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>After implementing the Ipas VCAT model for several years and evaluating the efficacy of addressing attitudes and values of HCPs regarding abortion, Aahung modified and adapted the tools to overcome barriers to FP. For this purpose, Aahung developed training modules in local dialects and a variety of audio-visual tools to help HCPs and midlevel providers understand and implement the VCAT model in their practices. This activity was done to enhance the comfort level of the service providers so that women from the rural areas of Sindh can get quality sexual and reproductive health services free from stigma and discrimination.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Aahung’s interventions were focused over one a half years in two districts of Sindh including Thatta and Badin. Aahung conducted a total of 11 capacity building trainings and trained 292 healthcare providers including Women Medical Officers (WMOs), Medical Officers (MOs) and Nurses and midlevel providers including Community Midwives (CMWs), Female Welfare Workers (FWWs) and Lady Health Visitors (LHVs). The approach included a strong value clarification component for providers to address the root causes of negative and judgmental attitudes towards clients, and for sustainable improvement in client-provider interaction. The change in knowledge and attitudes of the service providers was assessed by pre and post-tests.</p><p>Aahung periodically followed up with participants to identify their learnings and challenges while implementing SRH and FP related content in their practice. Based on those learnings and challenges, Aahung conducted a two-day refresher training for all the trained participants in both the districts.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Aahung’s implementation of VCAT sessions for issues related to SRHR and FP in its trainings resulted in a drastic change in the knowledge and attitude of the trained service providers. As a result participants were comfortable, unbiased and non-judgmental during mock FP counseling sessions in the training. Service providers also seemed more comfortable while replicating the topic of FP and post abortion care.</p><p>Moreover, pre and post-tests showed a significant improvement in knowledge and attitudes of HCPs and midlevel providers. For example, before the training 40% HCPs agreed that contraceptive choice should be made by clients, while after the training 88% of participants endorsed the client’s right to choose their contraceptive options. Moreover, pre-tests revealed that 55% of HCPs agreed that pregnancy after a miscarriage was challenging, while this figure fell to 0% after the training. 32% service providers believed that using contraceptives before first pregnancy would cause no harm; while 74% agreed with this statement following the training. 48% of service providers mentioned that hormonal methods including injectables and implants do not cause infertility; a figure which improved to 86% after the training.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>To work on FP in a conservative and challenging environment where fertility is very laden with cultural myths and misconceptions, it becomes important to clarify cultural myths and misinformation at all levels. Along with building skills and developing knowledge, addressing foundational values plays a vital role in transforming the attitudes of service providers and ultimately should be included in all SRHR health care provider trainings, particularly related to FP.</p><p>Aahung found HCPs and midlevel providers to be integral for transforming client’s discomfort and stigma attached to the uptake of contraceptive methods which leads to restricted discussions around FP and uptake of contraceptives. VCAT as a foundational session helped the HCPs in transforming their values and beliefs while providing services to their clients. For example, during a refresher training, one of the doctors shared that “after attending the training I came across several women who wanted to delay their first pregnancy but they were afraid of using any contraceptive methods since other providers or their friends told them it causes infertility. I was able to provide these clients with correct information and contraceptive options.” Aahung also learnt that it’s important to have training modules in local languages in order to engage the participants. In addition, interactive audio-visual tools aid in developing clarity and provide culturally appropriate language to service providers so that they can communicate with clients about FP issues with comfort.</p>",

      "title": "Digging deeper into the measurement of pregnancy intentions: Identifying strengthened measurement for informing program and policy",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The need for family planning (FP) in developing countries is usually expressed via two widely used indicators:  the percentage of women with an unmet need for FP and the percentage of recent births that were unintended (mistimed or unwanted).  Recent estimates demonstrate that about 214 million women of reproductive age in developing countries have an unmet need for modern contraception, that is they are sexually active, want to delay or avoid pregnancy, and are not using a modern method of contraception.  Further, about 40% of pregnancies globally are unintended, that is the pregnancy was reported to come sooner than desired or was not wanted at all.  </p><p>Each of these indicators use a woman’s report of her fertility desires, either retrospectively or prospectively.  Recent studies have criticized the use of these intention-based indicators because of the often low correlation with pregnancy/birth outcomes and the fact that fertility intentions are fluid. Additional critiques of these measures demonstrated that many women do not or cannot plan their fertility, women are not necessarily empowered to make fertility decisions, and partners and other family members who influence fertility decision-making are not captured by these individual-level indicators.  </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Using recently collected data from Nigeria, this study examines the validity of intention-based measures and determines the association between retrospective and prospective measures of fertility intentions and subsequent family planning behaviors. We also examine how fertility intentions change over a four-year follow-up period.  We hypothesize that women who are less consistent with their fertility intentions either across measures within the same survey or over time will be less likely to use a FP method.  This inconsistency may be indicative of ambivalence toward pregnancy planning and/or ambivalence toward contraception. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Multi-stage, representative household surveys from select cities and rural areas in Nigeria were undertaken by the Measurement, Learning &amp; Evaluation project in 2010/11, 2015, and 2017.  In total, cross-sectional data are available from 36,976 women from the different time periods; this analysis focuses on women in union at the time of survey (n=23,247).  Future fertility intentions are examined among all women in union and among women who had a birth in the last 2 years. We compare the intentionality of a recent birth to the intention to get pregnant in the future. Additionally, in 2015 and 2017, women were asked about postpartum FP use in the year after the birth.  Prior research examining postpartum FP use has suffered from small sample sizes making it difficult to conduct detailed analyses.  To supplement the above data, a longitudinal follow-up of women from 2010/11 was undertaken in 2014; about 64% of the original sample was found (n=10,672).  The longitudinal sample of women in union at baseline (n=6,757) is used to examine how prospective fertility intentions correspond to subsequent fertility experience and contraceptive behaviors.  Multivariate analyses will be undertaken to determine which women report consistent fertility intentions and how this relates to FP behaviors. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In the appended, cross-sectional sample of women in union (N=23,247), 42% report that they want a pregnancy soon.  Approximately 21% report that they want to delay the next pregnancy &gt;2 years and 27% report that they do not want any(more) children.  The wantedness of recently experienced pregnancies demonstrates that most pregnancies/births are considered wanted at the time of pregnancy (87%) whereas 10% were reported as wanted later and 3% were not wanted at all.  Comparison of future fertility intentions to the wantedness of the last pregnancy indicates fluidity of desires. Among women whose last pregnancy was not wanted at all (N=329), 66% report that they do not want any more children; however, 13% report wanting another child soon, and 15% report wanting another child after two years.  Further, while women who reported the last pregnancy as unwanted are significantly more likely than all other women to use a modern contraceptive method in the year postpartum (50%) or currently use a modern method (40%), use remains low relative to the desire to not get pregnant. In the longitudinal sample, among women who do not want to get pregnant at baseline, only 15% have a pregnancy in the four-year follow-up period. Among women who wanted a pregnancy or wanted to delay, pregnancy experience was higher at 55% and 66%, respectively.  Of note, the overwhelming majority of pregnancies experienced between baseline and four-year follow-up were considered “wanted then,” even among those women who said they did not want to get pregnant at baseline. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>We found inconsistent reporting about retrospective and prospective fertility intentions and FP behaviors among Nigerian women.  These data indicate pro-natalist views toward pregnancy/birth, potential ambivalence toward pregnancy or contraceptive use, and changes in life circumstance.  Of note, fertility desires may be fluid as shown in earlier studies. Therefore, traditional measures of fertility intentions that typically dichotomize pregnancies/births as intended or unintended may miss the nuances that are the reality of women’s (and men’s and couple’s) lives. The FP field seeks to reduce unintended pregnancies as a key outcome of FP programming. This  measurement endeavor is challenging for multiple reasons. First, it is hard to measure what doesn’t happen (i.e., prevention of unintended pregnancies). Second, because a woman’s fertility desires change over time, questions about the intentionality at the time of the pregnancy may not be the same as the intentionality at the time of birth. Further, women (and men and couples) are likely to change their fertility desires over the course of their relationships or life course which may result in inconsistent reporting on surveys. Finally, women may be ambivalent toward future childbearing and contraception and this may lead to inconsistent responses to what appear to be simple questions for the researcher.  Findings from this study on who is more consistent in reporting can be used to help make policy and programmatic recommendations on how to target FP resources to be the most effective for addressing long-term goals of ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health for all women. </p>",

      "title": "The contribution of Pregnant and postpartum women to estimates of unmet need for family planning",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Unmet need for family planning is defined as the proportion of women who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using a modern method of contraception (Bradley, Croft, &amp; Fishel, 2011). It estimates the amount by which contraceptive prevalence would need to increase if fertility intentions were fully realized, and is intended as a population-level estimate, rather than identifying individual women in need of contraception (Bradley &amp; Casterline, 2014). It is split into unmet need for spacing versus limiting (want no more children). Pregnant or postpartum amenorrheic (PPP) women need to be included in any measure of unmet need, because they could have had an unmet need at the time of conception. However, defining unmet need in postpartum women encounters the problem that many are wholly or partially protected by lactational amenorrhea or postpartum abstinence and thus have a reason for postponement of contraception regardless of future childbearing wishes (Shah, Santhya, &amp; Cleland, 2015). The multitude of definitions and estimates of unmet need amongst PPP women demonstrates the uncertainty of how to handle this group of women in measures of unmet need(Cleland, Shah, &amp; Benova, 2015). Nevertheless, unmet need following pregnancy is particularly important because of the health benefits of spacing.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We investigate the contribution of PPP women to overall unmet need, and investigate the characteristics of these women with regards to fertility intentions (spacing/limiting), age, and marital status.</p><p>We hypothesize that PPP women who didn’t want to get pregnant and are identified as having unmet need based on their retrospective reports, are more likely to report their pregnancy/child as mistimed (unmet need for spacing), rather than unwanted (unmet need for limiting), due to ex post rationalization.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We use microdata sets for 197 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and 24 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) across 80 countries between 1900 and 2017. DHS and MICS are nationally-representative household survey programmes. Because of the diversity between surveys and to facilitate analyses, original DHS and MICS variables were harmonized across the surveys. The variables of interest included age, marital status, current use of contraception (and method), and the variables needed to calculate unmet need for family planning including prospective and retrospective fertility intentions. The countries included in this analysis are not representative of the region, but are included because of the availability of datasets.</p><p>For the most recent survey in each country, we calculate unmet need according to the DHS definition(Bradley et al., 2011), and split the estimate into two groups: PPP women and not-PPP women. We look at the relative contribution to overall unmet need of four groups: PPP versus not-PPP, and spacing versus limiting. Using all surveys, we report on the contribution of spacing to overall unmet need for PPP women versus not-PPP women, by age-group and total women age 15-49. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>There is great diversity in the proportion of all women with unmet need (married and unmarried, age 15-49). There tends to be greater unmet need in the presented countries in Africa than in Asia or Latin America and the Caribbean. PPP women account for a large proportion of the women who are classified as having an unmet need. More than half of the women who have an unmet need for family planning in Burundi, Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda as well as in Bolivia and Peru were pregnant or postpartum at the time of the. Generally, about one in four women with unmet need are pregnant or postpartum in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. In most Asian countries this number is much lower, about one in ten women.</p><p>The contribution of spacing to overall unmet need is greater among PPP than not-PPP women , supporting the hypothesis that PPP women are more likely to retrospectively report an unintended pregnancy as mistimed rather than unwanted. The exception is young women under age 25, for whom the contribution of spacing to overall unmet need tends to be greater among PPP than not-PPP women, however it is important to keep in mind that young women are an unusual group for this analysis, since it is less likely that women at the beginning of their reproductive years want to limit their childbearing at all.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>We demonstrate the large contribution of pregnant or postpartum women to levels of unmet need for family planning, especially in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, by decomposing the unmet need indicator into PPP and non-PPP women. This indicates a substantial number of women who have been failed, as they experienced an unintended pregnancy. Knowing the contribution of PPP to unmet need has implications for family planning programming including post-partum services, given these women do not necessarily require services now, but may need them soon. We further find a link between the retrospective reporting of fertility intentions and elevated levels of unmet need for spacing. Compared to women who prospectively declare fertility intentions, PPP women who report retrospectively appear to be more likely to answer that a pregnancy was wanted at a later time rather than unwanted at all.</p><p>Future analysis will look at differences by marital status with a focus on unmarried women. In standard DHS reporting for unmarried women, unmet need is calculated for a subset of the population – those who are sexually active. This results in a reduction of the number of women who are considered to have unmet need because PPP women fulfilling the criteria for unmet need are excluded if they are not sexually active(Kantorova, Dasgupta, &amp; Ueffing, 2017). Therefore, our further analysis will investigate by marital status, regardless of whether unmarried women are sexually active or not. </p>",

      "title": "The role of attitudes towards pregnancy in contraceptive continuation: results from a longitudinal study of married women in India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Unmet need for family planning is a useful aggregate indicator, but at an individual level, it does not accurately predict whether a woman wants to use a contraceptive method or would do so given the opportunity. To better understand the relationship between pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use, it is crucial to measure various attitudes towards pregnancy, acknowledging that these attitudes may contradict each other, and women may be ambivalent (Miller 1986). </p><p>Recent studies have examined the interactive effect of two domains of pregnancy attitudes on contraceptive use: cognitive and affective attitudes (Jones 2017; Yoo et al. 2014). Cognitive attitudes capture a person’s belief or knowledge, while affective attitudes capture feelings. A woman can believe it is important to avoid pregnancy (cognitive), but also feel happy if she were to get pregnant (affective), or vice versa. This woman would be considered ambivalent towards pregnancy.</p><p>Most studies examining pregnancy attitudes through this lens have taken place in the United States. Very few have examined pregnancy attitudes in India. Additionally, most studies examining attitudes aim to predict their effect on current contraceptive use. This study aims to assess whether pregnancy attitudes predict contraceptive continuation after 3 months among married women in India.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The research questions this study aims to answer are:</p>\t<li>What is the prevalence of pregnancy ambivalence among a sample of married women in India?</li>\t<li>Do cognitive and affective attitudes towards pregnancy affect contraceptive continuation after 3 months?</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data come from an ongoing, 12-month longitudinal study of married women aged 15-49 in India who began a new episode of IUD, injectable, or pill use at study enrollment (12/2016-10/2017). Pregnancy attitudes were captured in the 3-month survey and asked of women who want children in the future. The sample was limited to contraceptive users at 3-month and those not lost to follow-up at 6-month (n=559).</p><p>Affective attitudes were measured by agreement with a 4-category Likert scale: “If I found out I was pregnant in the next several weeks, I would be happy.” Cognitive attitudes were measured by a 10-point scale to: “How important is it to you to avoid a pregnancy now?” Both scales were dichotomized at their midpoints. Adapting the approach and terms from prior research, a joint 4-category measure was constructed as the main predictor: pro-pregnancy (would be happy if pregnant/unimportant to avoid), anti-pregnancy (unhappy/important), positive ambivalent (happy/important) and negative ambivalent (unhappy/unimportant). The outcome was continuation of contraceptive method after 3 months.</p><p>Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses of background characteristics and continuation were conducted. A multivariate logistic regression to assess the effect of attitudes on continuation was conducted, adjusted for covariates based on bivariate significance and goodness-of-fit.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Most of the respondents were under the age of 25 (65.1%), had one living child (80.3%), attended secondary school or higher (63.5 %), were Hindu (93.9%) and worked as housewives (95.2%).</p><p>The majority (71.1%) held anti-pregnancy attitudes – they would be unhappy if they found out they were pregnant and reported it was important to avoid pregnancy. Many were positively ambivalent – they would be happy if they found out they were pregnant but believed it was important to avoid (18.2%). Fewer were negatively ambivalent (4.9%, would be unhappy/unimportant to avoid) and pro-pregnancy (5.8%, would be happy/unimportant to avoid). After 3 months, 17.0% of respondents had discontinued their method.</p><p>Results of the multivariate model of the effect of attitudes on contraceptive continuation (adjusted for age, parity, and education) showed that attitudes played a significant role in continuation after 3 months. Women who had anti-pregnancy attitudes (would be unhappy/important to avoid) were 3.26 times more likely to continue than those who were pro-pregnancy (would be happy/unimportant to avoid) (AOR=3.26, CI:1.50-7.07). Women who were positively ambivalent (would be happy/important to avoid) were also more likely to continue using than pro-pregnancy women (AOR=2.51, CI:1.03-6.10). However, women with negative ambivalence (would be unhappy/unimportant to avoid) were not significantly different from those who were pro-pregnancy in continuation of contraception (AOR=3.10, CI:0.85-11.4). There were no other significant differences among attitudinal groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences in continuation by age, parity, or education after adjusting for attitudes towards pregnancy.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study examines the prevalence of pregnancy ambivalence and the effect of cognitive and affective attitudes on contraceptive continuation among married women in India. Results demonstrate that nearly one quarter of contraceptive users who desire future children were ambivalent, and continuation differed by attitudes towards pregnancy.</p><p>Women with anti-pregnancy or positively ambivalent attitudes were more likely than pro-pregnancy women to continue using after three months, while negatively ambivalent women did not differ from pro-pregnancy women. The two groups who were more likely to continue than pro-pregnancy users—anti-pregnancy and positively ambivalent—are similar in that they both feel it is important to avoid a pregnancy, regardless of how happy they would feel if they found out they were pregnant. This suggests that cognitive attitudes about pregnancy may play a larger role in decision-making surrounding continuation than affective attitudes. This may be due to the methods women used, which were primarily methods requiring planning and cognitive, rational decision-making outside of sexual intercourse.</p><p>These results show that attitudes towards pregnancy are multifaceted, can be contradictory, and may be more nuanced than current measures of intentions allow for. Understanding affective and cognitive attitudes towards pregnancy may help providers predict who is likely to stop using their method in the future, and whether these discontinuers would have an unmet need. To further understand how attitudes affect continuation, analysis including 12-month follow-up data will be conducted to examine factors associated with ambivalence, how attitudes change over time, and whether additional factors affect the relationship.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK) provides a wide range of high quality, affordable and client-centred sexual and reproductive health services to women and young people throughout Kenya.  In addition to community-based strategies, a key component of MSK’s service delivery include safe abortion and post-abortion care (SA/PAC) and provision of contraceptive options to clients through a network of 24 centres across the country.  SA/PAC clients often have an unmet need for family planning, and offering a choice of contraception following SA/PAC can support women to prevent subsequent unintended pregnancy and ensure adequate spacing between pregnancies. </p><p>Since 2014, MSK has used a bespoke electronic client-level information centre (CLIC) to collect routine programme data and monitor service delivery in real-time.  CLIC captures client demographic information and services received at each visit, generating clinical and programme indicators that enable MSK to make evidence-informed decisions that improve client care.  We used CLIC data to assess post-abortion family planning (PAFP) uptake among SA/PAC clients at MSK centres, in order to guide further action to address women’s reproductive health needs.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We assessed PAFP trends, PAFP contraceptive methods, and subsequent use of SA/PAC services among clients who accessed SA/PAC at MSK centres.  Client choice of methods for both SA/PAC and contraceptive services is central to MSK’s client-centred service delivery strategy.  Therefore, we also compared clients who had medical SA/PAC to those who had surgical SA/PAC, to answer the following questions: a) How did uptake of PAFP change over time and by SA/PAC method?  b) Did PAFP contraceptive methods differ among medical and surgical SA/PAC clients?  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We analysed routine data from the CLIC system, among women who visited Marie Stopes centres for SA/PAC services in Kenya from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Oct 2017. Visit-level data were examined by client age and type of SA/PAC service received (medical or surgical).  Service visit data for unique clients were linked over time to assess the proportion of women who returned at a later date for PAFP, contraceptive methods received, and subsequent SA/PAC services.  Clients who chose a modern method of contraception on the same day or within 14 days of the SA/PAC visit were considered to have taken up PAFP.  Women may have returned in the days following a SA/PAC visit for follow-up, so only SA/PAC visits occurring at least 45 days after the previous visit were counted as a subsequent unique SA/PAC.  Data were analysed in Stata version 11, using chi-square tests to assess differences in proportions.  We examined a total of 46,531 SA/PAC services (26,084 medical and 20,447 surgical) among 45,004 women. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The total number of SA/PAC services varied from 991 to 1726 per month, and the proportion medical SA/PAC increased from 43.8% in 2015 to 64.5% in 2017.  Almost two-thirds of clients were single (65.0%) and their age distribution was:  <p>Choice of LAPM was greater among surgical vs medical SA/PAC clients who had PAFP (76.5% vs 64.2%, respectively).  While surgical SA/PAC clients were more likely to choose LARC, a greater proportion chose IUDs (37.3% vs 13.1% for medical SA/PAC clients) and medical SA/PAC clients tended to choose implants.   </p><p>Among 15,590 women who accessed SA/PAC in 2016, 600 (3.8%) had a subsequent SA/PAC; this was greater among women who did not have PAFP (5.3%) compared to those who had PAFP (3.0%; p</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>We found that uptake of PAFP increased from 2015 to 2017 among clients who accessed SA/PAC services at MSK centres. PAFP uptake was consistently greater among women who had surgical SA/PAC each year.  Furthermore, PAFP contraceptive method differed by SA/PAC method, with higher LAPM uptake, especially IUD, among clients who had surgical SA/PAC.   This may reflect that IUD is the only method of PAFP that cannot be taken on the day of the medical SA/PAC services, while it can be chosen on the day of the surgical procedure. Further investigation using qualitative methods may be helpful to gain more insight and to develop client-centred interventions that ensure women receive FP methods appropriate to their needs and preferences. </p><p>Qualitative studies have often found that women prefer to complete the SA/PAC process before choosing a PAFP method, and this may partially explain the lower PAFP uptake among women who chose a medical method. It is important to ensure there are mechanisms that support women to access follow up PAFP information and methods after their service. While follow-up time was limited to assess subsequent SA/PAC up to October 2017 only, subsequent SA/PAC was relatively low overall, and even lower among clients who had PAFP.  Follow-up strategies for clients who choose short-term contraceptive methods following SA/PAC may help to improve continuation and ensure women have access to family planning.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>High unmet need for birth spacing and increase in institutional deliveries led Government of India to reinvigorate postpartum family planning (PPFP), with a focus on expanding PPFP choices and enhancing capacity of service providers (doctors and nurse-midwives) to provide services for postpartum intrauterine contraceptive device (PPIUCD), a safe, effective, long-acting and reversible contraceptive. PPIUCD services have been initiated in 2010 and scaled-up substantially from 2010 to 2017. During these years, Jhpiego supported government in this initiative by providing technical assistance to high delivery-load health facilities in 19 out of 29 states in India, for different periods of time. With this technical assistance, the services were implemented in 21 high delivery load facilities of 3 states in 2010 and progressively scaled up to about 2000 (cumulative) facilities in 19 states in 2017. Number of PPIUCD insertions increased from 4,969 in 2010 to 533,224 in 2017, which make the cumulative number of PPIUCD insertions as 1,579,640 during 2010-2017. Given the extent to which PPIUCD services are being scaled-up, it is important to examine the post-insertion outcomes, which reflect on quality of PPIUCD services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>PPIUCD services were strengthened through existing government health system. Program interventions to ensure quality services included participatory training of 4,995 doctors and 14,630 nurses through centralized and on-site training emphasizing on informed choice, practice on humanistic model and supervised client-practice, followed by supportive supervision-visits to work-sites within 3 weeks of training and as per need. 83 training-sites were strengthened. Equipped counselling corners were established and counsellors, nurse-midwives were trained in counselling. PPIUCD acceptors were followed-up. Facility-based internal-assessments were done using performance-standards, dashboard indicators to address gaps. Software based data-management and analysis of follow-up findings helped to inform health-facility and program.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Service statistics from facilities providing PPIUCD services were analysed. This analysis included 1,579,640 PPIUCD insertions out of 13,301,903 deliveries (representing 12% of institutional deliveries); and follow-up of 886,144 clients via clinic visits and telephone, after 6 weeks of insertion (making follow-up rate as 56%). Findings of follow-up cases were monitored.</p><p>A separate study was conducted by Jhpiego to examine the continuation rate at the end of 1 year (yet to be published).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Follow-up findings of PPIUCD acceptors after 6 weeks of insertion show that expulsion rate, which is the main concern with PPIUCD, is at 3.2%; infection rate at 1.5% and removal rate at 6.1%, among clients followed-up. The remaining 89% clients have no complaints. If year-wise expulsion rates are considered, it shows that expulsion remained at this acceptable level throughout the period of 2010-2017. After 6 months of insertion, 8 PPIUCD clients (rate lower than 0.001%) were diagnosed with uterine perforations and all were managed successfully. A separate study found that 62.8% PPIUCD clients were continuing with the method at 1 year post-insertion follow-up. Removal and expulsion rates at 1 year were 29.7% and 7.5%, respectively.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Follow-up findings for complications were comparable or lower than other published studies, reflecting the quality of services provided. These post-insertion findings are important outcome of quality of PPIUCD services because the likelihood of expulsion and infection depend on providers competency including insertion-technique and aseptic measures followed during insertion. Relatively higher removal rates that are mainly due to bleeding and cramping need to be addressed by improving the quality of counselling with upfront information on side effects of bleeding and cramping and what to expect. Given the positive results from client follow-up, the focused programmatic interventions contributed in rapid scale-up of PPIUCD services without compromising on quality. India’s experience proves that integration of FP with maternal health services can increase uptake of postpartum modern contraception. The platform created at health facilities for PPIUCD service provision, starting from counselling during antenatal period to actual service provision and post-insertion follow-up, opens opportunities for adding newer family planning methods as postpartum family planning options for women who have institutional deliveries, in the country. These program implications and lessons can be helpful as more and more countries introduce and scale up postpartum family planning in the immediate postpartum period.</p>",

      "title": "Particularly problematic: Assessing the extent to which distinct subtypes of side effects differentially predict method discontinuation in urban Nigeria",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Early contraceptive discontinuation contributes to low contraceptive prevalence and can lead to mistimed, unplanned, or unwanted pregnancy. Substantial resources have been and continue to be invested in Nigeria towards improving the quality of family planning counseling services and the suitability of the contraceptive method mix available at family planning facilities, both factors known to promote successful contraceptive continuation.  The increasing promotion of long-acting methods has been a cornerstone of Nigeria’s efforts to increase continuation rates, but there is a need for discontinuation research to keep up with the experiences of a population that will be increasingly marked by LARC users. While it is well established globally that side effects in general are a principal contributor to method dissatisfaction and early discontinuation, there is a need for prospective study examining which particular side effects are especially concerning or relevant for urban Nigerian users in an evolving method mix. This specificity of inquiry in Nigeria and elsewhere can enable family planning educators and providers in to better channel limited time and attention towards those side effects that are especially troublesome to the user experience, while program managers can take these side effects into consideration in their decisions around method research and promotion.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study sought to examine the extent to which specific perceived bodily changes are differentially linked to method discontinuation by urban Nigerian family planning clients in a LARC-heavy facility system, after accounting for the influence of method type, facility-level factors, and individual characteristics. The purpose of focusing on the endpoint of stopping one’s baseline method, instead of overall contraceptive continuation, is to isolate which side effects are most bothersome or disruptive in this population of contraceptive users, so that they can become the focus of future research and practical interventions for informed method choice and improved contraceptive management.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This analysis draws on a clinic-based sample of 519 female clients ages 19-49 accessing facility-based family planning services in the Nigerian cities of Ibadan and Kaduna. Users were followed prospectively for one year from the day of their selection of a new contraceptive method in consultation with a FP provider. Their contraceptive choices, behaviors, and influences were assessed through three semi-structured survey waves (baseline face-to-face exit interview and two follow-up telephone interviews at 3-4 months and 12-13 months). Side effect descriptions were elicited through open-ended short answer questions, then qualitatively categorized, counted, ranked by frequency, and converted to indicator variables.  Discrete time complementary log-log survival analysis was conducted in Stata 15 to isolate the relative odds of a client discontinuing their baseline contraceptive method during one of the two follow-up periods within the first year, given exposure to one of the following specific side effects: amenorrhea, longer menses, heavier menses, irregular menses, abdominal pain, and/or weight changes.  Models controlled for baseline method type and key demographic and social-psychological predictors of method discontinuation, and accounted for facility-level clustering of responses through random intercepts and robust variance error estimators.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Of the 519 participants (53.4% LARC users), 116 women stopped using their baseline method within the first year of use. Contrary to our expectations, the generic experience of having at least one undesirable side effect was not strongly linked to method discontinuation at typical statistical thresholds (OR 1.41, <em>0.96-1.06, </em>p=0.083). However, when specific side effects were examined separately, several were significantly predictive of method discontinuation. Based on estimates from the adjusted model, women with amenorrhea would be expected to have more than twice the odds of stopping their method compared to women without this side effect (OR 2.16, <em>1.17-4.00</em>, p=0.013). Undesirable weight changes were associated on average with a doubling of the likelihood of method discontinuation (OR 2.01, <em>1.04-3.88</em>, p=0.036). Heavier flow and intermittent bleeding did not predict method discontinuation for the average user, but having an extended number of days of bleeding per cycle actually <em>decreased</em> the expected rate of method discontinuation by an estimated 70% for the subgroup of women with a history of inter-partner violence, attenuating the threefold increase in method stopping otherwise associated with past IPV (relative OR 0.28, <em>0.11-0.74</em>, p=0.011; past IPV OR 3.60, <em>1.52-8.49</em>, p=0.004). Amenorrhea, in contrast, may increase the likelihood of method stopping among otherwise determined users who are especially fearful of an unplanned pregnancy, though this could not be confirmed (relative OR 2.29, <em>0.90-5.90</em>, p=0.083).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Even after controlling for method type, weight changes and amenorrhea stood out as being distinctively likely to prompt method discontinuation in this sample. Both are likely effects of the implant as well as the injection and, to a lesser extent, the pill. Interestingly, neither are especially plausible for IUD users, while longer menses was actually protective in one subgroup, leading us to consider that the continued reticence among Nigerians to choose uterine contraception – amidst the rapid uptake of the subdermal implant and sustained popularity of the injection – may actually be misaligned with some women’s side effect preferences.</p><p></p><p>Importantly, not all menstrual issues had the same relationship to method continuation.  Research on method suitability or contraceptive management should differentiate between subtypes of menstrual changes. FP providers and workers could use probing questions to hone in on those that are of special concern to the clinic client, workshop participant, radio listener or mobile app user.</p><p></p><p>The extent to which a side effect may prompt method changes can vary by social-psychological situation. Users with a stronger need to avoid pregnancy may find amenorrhea especially intolerable as it heightens pregnancy anxiety. Clients apprehensive of triggering partner violence may find longer bleeding cycles to provide de-escalating “evidence” of not being pregnant. Qualitative research should seek to explain the reasons for these associations and explore what may color the meaning of certain side effects for clients in other life scenarios. Meanwhile, this underscores the continued programmatic importance of training providers in localized issues and personalized counseling.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recently updated its recommendations in the <em>Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (5th Edition)</em> on the use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in women at high risk of HIV acquisition, shifting from Category 1 (“A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method”) to Category 2 (“A condition where the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks”). The unusual interim update is based on a systematic review demonstrating a risk of HIV acquisition 1.4 times higher among DMPA users compared to controls.</p><p>WHO encouraged family planning (FP) implementing organizations to translate this recommendation into programming tools and guidance. Marie Stopes International and Marie Stopes Tanzania (MST) partnered with the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) to develop a provider training package and job aids on the new guidance and test client and provider understanding of the new DMPA and HIV risk messages—the first FP partner to do so.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We designed a pilot study to investigate (1) provider and client comprehension of WHO’s new guidance on DMPA and HIV risk, including if and to what extent providers are able to internalize WHO’s counselling messages and adapt them to their service environment; (2) if and to what extent the new guidance heightened existing or led to the development of new provider biases related to DMPA, hormonal contraception, and FP in general; and (3) if and how the new recommendations affect clients’ decision-making on contraception, including the decision to use a specific method or to use contraception at all.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We developed a two-day training package and two job aids. We used the DMPA/HIV risk counselling messages included in WHO’s <em>‘Family Planning – A Global Handbook</em> <em>for Providers’ </em>in these materials, a foundational resource for many service delivery organisations, and we determined that the original generic text was be applicable to the Tanzanian context.</p><p>In 2018, we trained 12 MST providers (all working in rural or peri-urban mobile outreach) from Mbeya, Tanga, and Dar es Salaam—all regions with a high uptake of injectable contraception and varying HIV prevalence.</p><p>We used mixed methods: (1) four provider focus groups; (2) observations of client-provider interactions (using structured checklist) (n=36); (3) semi-structured exit interviews with clients (n=78); and (4) routine service statistics to assess trends in method utilisation and mix. Client participants were aged 18-49; living with or without HIV; and demonstrating an interest in injectable contraception prior to individual counselling or with no method in mind. Given the generalized nature of Tanzania’s HIV epidemic, we determined that for the purposes of this study all women in Tanzania should be considered at high risk of HIV acquisition.</p><p>We analysed qualitative data thematically; and used descriptive statistics and time-series analysis to analyse quantitative data.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Data collection was completed in February 2018. Preliminary analysis shows that providers conveyed all five counselling messages to clients in 81% of observed consultations; however, providers told clients that DMPA can cause HIV in 19% of observations. No providers told clients that FP in general causes HIV.</p><p>Providers mostly understood the new guidance; however, the nuance of  the guidance text stating that DMPA users are “slightly more likely than other women” to acquire HIV was not always clear to them. Several providers expressed the need to be updated as soon as possible on ongoing studies on hormonal contraception and HIV risk. They generally found it difficult to express to clients the meaning of the current recommendations and evidence, and this put them “in a dilemma”, with their clients leaving the clinic “with discomfort.” They wanted clearer information on the physiological mechanisms of increased HIV acquisition risk in DMPA users.</p><p>The majority of clients interviewed (93%) were able to recall or describe a link between DMPA and HIV risk; however, similarly to providers, the nuances of “higher risk” to acquire HIV as compared to other FP methods was often not well understood. While only one client interviewed reported switching from DMPA to another method due to the new guidance, trends in method mix from routine service statistics will be presented at the conference.  </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Since WHO’s updated guideline stipulates that all women at high risk for HIV intending to use DMPA should be informed about the potential increased risk of infection, there is a need to develop, test, and operationalise programming guidance and communication materials on this topic in all countries. The WHO recommendation and updated guideline does not define ‘high risk of HIV acquisition’ or provide detailed guidance on how women should be informed of the risk. An over-zealous implementation of the guidance could result in unnecessary restrictions on DMPA use, which may result in turn in increased unintended pregnancies and negative maternal health outcomes. Since settings with generalised HIV epidemics in Eastern and Southern Africa, including Tanzania, also have high levels of DMPA use, it is critical to develop effective communication on this topic without limiting women’s access to hormonal contraception more broadly.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate operationalisation of the complex recommendations. Our complete analysis will show whether providers and clients are misinterpreting these recommendations, and also whether they are influencing choice of methods. These learnings will be critical for other FP and HIV organisations attempting to develop their own implementation guidance and training programmes.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Bangladesh has made commendable success in increasing modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rates (mCPR), from 5% in 1975 to 54% in 2014. The mCPR has increased due to availability and accessibility of a choice of temporary, long acting and permanent (LAPM) methods in the basket of contraceptives (‘cafeteria approach’). However, among the modern methods a significant reduction in use of LAMP is observed and conversely high dependence on temporary methods such as pills (27%), injectables (12.4%) and condoms (6.4%) has contributed to high discontinuation rate of 30%. The highest rate of discontinuations were among condom users (39.9%) followed by pills (34.2%) and injectables (24.9%).</p><p>In 2014, only 2.3% of the eligible couples used long acting reversible contraceptive (IUD and implant) and another 6% had a permanent method (male and female sterilization). Surprisingly for IUD, the use rate consistently declined from over 2% in 1993/94 to less than 1% in 2014. Use of implants has increased from 0.1% in 1996 to 1.7% in 2014. Among permanent methods, though male sterilization has slightly increased but female sterilizations have decreased from 9.1% in 1991 to 4.6% in 2014. Male sterilizations peaked in 1985 decreased to 0.5% in 2000 and has increased to 1.2% by 2014.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In the past few years the LAPMs have been stagnant while the dependency on the shorter acting temporary methods has increased. The uses of short acting methods are associated with higher discontinuation rates and subsequent unwanted pregnancies. In this study, we have tried to document the reasons for higher discontinuation rates of LA&amp;PMs in Bangladesh as well as global perspectives and to recommend appropriate and acceptable approaches for future intervention to promote LA&amp;PM uptake in Bangladesh. The main research question for this study is: What are the reasons for higher discontinuation rates of LA&amp;PMs in Bangladesh?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We completed a literature review to answer our research question. We retrieved and reviewed over 30 articles and finally selected 16 peer-reviewed journal articles, 6 published reports, and 1 policy brief for this review. Five databases were used for the literature search, which include Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, Springer, Medline, and Google Scholar. The search terms “discontinuation”, “reasons”, “barriers” and “factors” were used and combined with “LA&amp;PM contraceptive methods”, “Bangladesh”, “Egypt”, “Indonesia ”, “success”, and “Globally”. These three countries has chosen as Muslim predominant population.  The reasons of discontinuation or non-use were categorized in the areas of socio-demographic, socio-cultural, accessibility, religious, spousal communications, health concerns and side-effects, and knowledge gap. Screening of the articles was done by reading the titles, abstracts and skimming through the articles. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The review found that in Bangladesh, overall 85.4% women had some knowledge on LA&amp;PMs. A recent survey showed that around 63% of the respondents have knowledge on IUD, 68.2% on implants, 66.4% on tubectomy, and 45.6% has knowledge on vasectomy. Age plays an important role in method discontinuation. A study conducted in 2012 in Dhaka city found that, married adolescent girls between 15 to 19 years were more prone to choose short-term methods especially oral pills. A multi-country study revealed that poorer women in Bangladesh are more likely to use LA&amp;PMs than the wealthier. Societal norms such as son preferences often pose barriers among women for not using LA&amp;PMs. Findings from an Indian study showed that mothers of two girl children are not likely to use LA&amp;PMs than the mothers of two boys. One study showed that many women were not motivated to use LA&amp;PMs because they believe children are given by Allah, that’s why using LA&amp;PM is a sin. </p><p>Many studies showed that LA&amp;PMs have some method related side effects that hinder women to use those methods. A study from Nepal showed that one fifth of 230 women using IUD discontinued within the first year of insertion due to side-effects. Often misinformation and myths related to LA&amp;PMs influence them to discontinue a long acting method. The common misinformation about LA&amp;PMs is permanent infertility or loosing children.  Moreover, lack of husbands’ support in choosing long acting methods often result-in premature removal of IUDs and Implants.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our literature review indicate that the main reasons for discontinuation of LARC are side effects. Bleeding, lower abdominal pain and vaginal injury are the major complaints against injectables and IUDs, whereas, nausea and headache were the main reported side-effects for Implant users. Expulsion/displacement is the second major cause of discontinuation of IUDs. However, three case studies of Egypt, Indonesia and India those had high LA&amp;PM have shown that improved quality care, availability of services and strong local and national level networks can increase LA&amp;PM use by overcoming the barriers. </p><p>To increase LA&amp;PM use, Bangladesh can follow facility based IUD insertion immediately after delivery, because delivery may be the only time for many Bangladeshi women when they come in contact with a professional health care provider. In many studies this approach has been identified as safe, effective and convenient for women; although the process requires counseling which ideally initiates at the beginning of antenatal care. Besides, this approach can also be applicable for women who came to facility for menstrual regulation. </p><p>Public-private partnership to increase LA&amp;PM uptake can also be an effective approach for Bangladesh. Indonesia’s family planning programme showed that women’s NGOs can   motivate local women to use LA&amp;PMs. BRAC, a leading NGO in Bangladesh has formed women’s group for micro-credit. This huge network of NGOs can be effectively engaged in motivating women in the community for promoting LA&amp;PMs. Moreover, engagement of religious leaders through Ministry of Religion and Islamic Foundation of Bangladesh will increase uptake of LARC&amp;PMs in Bangladesh.</p>",

      "title": "Can a peer health educator model improve the Family Planning (FP) and Reproductive Health (RH) outcomes among female garment workers? –Evidence from Bangladesh",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The importance of the garment sector within Bangladesh’s economy is widely acknowledged, and its impact on women’s economic empowerment has been well documented, but there is a clear lack of evidence on garment workers’ health and wellbeing. Bangladesh has almost three million female garment workers (FGW), most of whom are married young women who are in their prime reproductive years (18 to 35 years old). FGWs, like many women in Bangladesh, lack adequate access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and family planning (FP) services. Over the last several years, there has been an increased effort to address the health, safety and wellbeing of garment factory workers in Bangladesh. Business for Social Responsibility (BSR)’s Health Enables Returns project (HERproject) is one such effort operating in Bangladesh under which the HERhealth model utilizes capacity building and workplace strengthening to improve the health-related knowledge and behaviors as well as access to health services and products of FGW residing in the urban and sub-urban areas of Dhaka. Although a limited body of evidence exists on women's health in the garment sector, existing studies have not included rigorous evaluations.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In this study, we present results from an evaluation conducted by the Evidence Project/Population Council, to assess the impact of the HERhealth model on improving SRHR knowledge and SRHR and FP practices among FGWs. The HERhealth curriculum uses participatory methods through group discussions, demonstrations, and other interactive activities to train selected FGWs from participating factories as peer health educators (PHE). Through a peer-to-peer outreach, PHE then train other FGWs. The HERhealth model covers topics including SRHR and FP, general and menstrual hygiene, HIV, AIDS and STIs, nutrition and occupational health and safety among others.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We present findings from a quantitative pre-and post-intervention evaluation study with control groups as well as a qualitative study with factory managers and implementing partners from a total of eight factories situated in Dhaka, Gazipur, and, Narayanganj districts. Quantitative data come from baseline and endline surveys of 4,118 FGWs (Baseline 2,165; Endline 1,953) collected in all 8 factories as part of the quasi-experimental design (4 HERhealth intervention, implemented in 2015-16; 4 control). In the analysis presented, we utilize a one-to-one Propensity Score Matching (PSM) design to generate an analytical sample of 3,276 workers, where 859 and 779 participants from 4 intervention factories at baseline and endline, respectively, were matched with participants from the 4 control factories at the two study time-points. To assess the impact of the HERhealth intervention, we estimated difference-in-differences (DiD) coefficients on selected SRH knowledge and practice indicators. For the qualitative study, 24 factory management staff from the 4 intervention factories and 4 project implementation staff were interviewed in-depth to explore opportunities and challenges in the implementation of the HERhealth model, and to assess opportunities for management to support the improvement of the health of FGWs. These qualitative interviews were performed using open-ended interview guides.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In the quantitative data, one third of all FGWs in our study (N=3,276) were between the ages of 18 and 25 years and a majority of workers were ever-married (90%). Between baseline and endline, intervention factories showed the most notable progress in raising awareness among FGWs regarding issues such as menstrual hygiene management (32% to 69%). More notably, improvements were also observed on healthy practices such as sanitary pad usage (23% to 72%), use of any FP methods (65% to 72%), and use of modern FP methods (56% to 61%). In all cases, the changes in intervention groups were larger in magnitude than in control groups. DiD coefficients generated utilizing multivariate regression suggest overall impacts of HERproject on health practices were statistically significant, in particular for utilization of sanitary pads (DiD=35.2, p<p>In the qualitative analysis, factory managers recognized positive health and business-related advantages of implementing HERhealth in their respective factories, including expressing an understanding of the connection between the health of their workers and factory productivity. Project implementation staff noted that the prime benefit of HERhealth was on healthy behaviors of workers. They noted that FGWs displayed increased awareness of personal hygiene, and as a result, used sanitary napkins, soap for better hygiene. As demand for sanitary napkins increased, factories responded by ensuring adequate supply of napkins in the factory clinic.</p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The results presented from this quasi-experimental evaluation study are among first of its kind to examine impacts on SRHR outcomes from a garment sector intervention, making the knowledge contributions unique and important, particularly as studies utilizing control groups are rare. The findings suggest that among FGWs, those who have been exposed to HERhealth have better knowledge on SRHR issues and have significantly higher utilization of FP methods, including that of modern contraceptives, and menstrual hygiene products, compared to their counterparts from control factories. Another unique aspect of the study is its concurrent examination of implementation processes and challenges, particularly as it relates to factory-based health interventions. Project implementation staff described challenges in scheduling training for workers with management, highlighting the competing demands of time in a factory setting, as well as frequent turnover of trainers. This knowledge will help improve the planning and implementation of future efforts. Overall, findings from both the quantitative and qualitative study indicate that the HERhealth program is an effective model when fully implemented, and had particular successes in improving modern FP uptake among FGWs. Learnings from the study, which have been disseminated to the participating factories, are being utilized to optimize the HERhealth intervention in participating factories as well as the overall program itself as it expands in Bangladesh. These results are also likely to be instrumental in helping BSR improve the effectiveness of their programs not only in Bangladesh, but in their supply chain programs worldwide.</p>",

      "title": "Contraceptive Choice and Decision Making among Garment Factory Workers in Cambodia: An Exploration of Determinants",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Cambodia’s garment sector, the nation’s largest formal employer, employs approximately 600,000 women. Female Garment Workers (FGW) are a unique population as most are young, in the prime of their reproductive years, and have migrated to Cambodia’s urban centers. Although FGW enjoy certain protections of being employed in the formal workforce, they remain vulnerable to unstable working conditions, lower wages, and lack of access to health services and information. FGW’s family planning (FP) practices differ considerably from Cambodia’s general population. Currently married FGW use contraceptives at much higher rates, with substantially higher uptake of oral contraceptives. Yet, traditional methods continue to have high uptake among FGW, with withdrawal being the second most commonly used method among this group. In addition, the use of other modern contraceptives such as injectables, and long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), remain much lower than the general population. The global literature suggests that contraceptive choice and decision-making is influenced by a range of factors such as access to FP services, parity, and social support. For a population where employment is intimately tied to women’s daily experiences as well as their family/social lives, little is known about the influences that work and family-related factors have on contraceptive choice.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In this study, we aim to understand contraceptive choice and decision-making among married FGW in Phnom Penh and Kandal provinces of Cambodia. We examine whether several proximate employment and family-related factors that are distinct to the sector, alongside traditionally known factors, influence workers’ non-use or uptake of particular forms of contraception. We hypothesize that women with less job stability, who are beginning their reproductive lives, and who are migrants - or a combination of these factors- are less likely to be using a contraceptive or using a traditional method, compared to oral contraceptives or other modern methods.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this study comes from a cross-sectional structured survey of FGWs conducted by the Population Council’s Evidence Project under the USAID funded WorkerHealth project in Cambodia.1004 FGW reproductive age (aged 18-49) from five participating factories in Phnom Penh and Kandal provinces participated in this study. Our analytical sample is restricted to married women as only a negligible proportion of unmarried women in the sample reported that they were sexually active. </p><p>We propose utilizing a multinomial logistic regression model to estimate the association of various work and family-related factors on FGW’s contraceptive choice. We construct the outcome variable with categories of non-use, traditional methods, the oral contraceptive, and other modern methods (including LARCs). Explanatory variables will focus on job stability as indicated by tenure at current job and level of pay, as well as factors such as parity, frequency of sex, migration-status, and social/familial support. Sequential models controlling for the effects of age, education, and socioeconomic status will be estimated for the analysis. We will also estimate similar models utilizing data from Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (2014) to qualitatively explore how the determinants of contraceptive decision-making differ between FGW and the general population of women.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Our analytical sample of currently married women (N=656) were on average 30.9 years old. While 17% had never had children, over 70% reported having either one or two children. Almost 29% of the sample was illiterate and 10% only partially literate. Only 28% had received a secondary level of education or higher. Six of ten women (57%) were migrants from other provinces and they earned a median monthly salary of $199.50. The median duration of work in their factory was 3 years. On contraceptive use, 31% reported not using a contraceptive, while 20% reported using a traditional method (dominated by withdrawal at 18.8%). Not surprisingly 42% of our sample reported the use of the oral pill. Uptake of other modern methods including injections and LARCs were relatively much lower (all under 3%).</p><p>Preliminary bivariate analyses show that parity significantly influences contraceptive use. A majority (80.2%) of women with no children reported not using a method. However, nearly half of women (49.5%) who had between 1 and 2 children reported using oral contraceptives (compared to 5.4% among those at zero parity). A further 9% reported using another modern method. Non-migrants had higher uptake of oral contraceptives (45.6%) and modern methods (9.2%) compared to migrants (39.4% and 6.4%, respectively). Age and literacy did not appear to influence contraceptive choice; uptake of the pill dominated all groups, with similar rates of non-use and traditional method uptake.</p><p>We will examine these relationships further, in the multinomial regression analysis, alongside job-stability and earnings related variables.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Cambodia’s female-dominated garment sector, much like the garment sectors of other Southeast Asian nations that employ millions of young women, is an important sector within which it is essential to expand the availability and improve the delivery of modern contraceptives to ensure that FP2020 targets are achieved. The finding that substantial proportions of FGW in Cambodia continue to rely on traditional methods or are non-users is a cause for concern. This study will be the first to rigorously examine factors and motivations that drive employed women’s contraceptive use and choice in this sector in Cambodia.</p><p>Some recent qualitative research indicates that the choice of short-term methods or traditional methods among Cambodian FGWs may be driven by their need for flexibility in their reproductive decision-making particularly if are recently married and beginning childbearing. The pressure on FGWs to establish fertility soon after marriage and the need for them to earn livelihoods lie at odds with each other, particularly as childbearing results in challenges for their employment and childcare. The results from this study will illuminate whether employment-related factors, particularly as it is related to job instability and pay, influences women’s reproductive decision-making, and thus determine their contraceptive choice. A better understanding of these dynamics, particularly alongside determinants of contraceptive choice among the general population, will facilitate the development of programs and policies focused on FGWs in Cambodia to improve and accelerate their access to effective and modern forms of contraception that can help meet their work and family obligations and goals.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Uganda Hotel Owner’s Association an umbrella body that brings together over 350 hotel owners estimates the number of employees to be 350,000 young people, 77% of these are aged between 18 and 30 years and over 60% are females, sexually active and unmarried. The industry usually demands long working hours and extensive engagement, this specifically lowers the need for children among the female staff since it is assumed that child bearing  interferes with their work. The 2015 USAID Reproductive Maternal Newborn and Child Health sharpened plan for Uganda and FP2020 commitment  focus on increasing access to family planning services for all sexually active people at all times and places. This is in a bid to address the high (28%) unmet need for family planning services, which is at 28% and 32% among the married and sexually active females in Uganda. Based on this, the USAID funded HIV/Health Initiative in Work Place Activity (HIWA) project implements workplace based FP interventions aimed at improving access to FP services for over 24,000 hotel staff working in 80 target hotels.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The project conducted a family planning needs assessment for 20 hotel workplaces which revealed major challenges that hinder the hotel staff  from accessing family planning services. This is partly due to the long working hours and restricted/tight schedules. In response to the challenges identified, HIWA in partnership with UHOA and Ministry of Health conducted 2 sensitizations sessions for a total of 121 hotel staff (68 females and 53 males) and trained 26 hotel staff (9 males and 17 females) from  25 hotels across urban towns in Uganda in the provision of Workplace based family planning education, counseling and short term</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The family planning needs assessment was conducted among 20 hotel workplaces located in the urban towns across Uganda in January 2018 using a semi-structured questionnaire. The results of the survey facilitated the identification of 26 hotel staff from 25 hotels who were trained as FP champions in March 2018. These were trained in the provision of community/workplace based family planning services using the 10-day training curriculum of Ministry of Uganda.</p><p></p><p>The training equipped trainees with knowledge and skills in FP counselling, education and provision of cost free short term reversible family planning methods to hotel staff at their workplaces, their families  and surrounding community .  .This intervention was aimed at reducing access barriers of waiting time, distance and cost among others. The FP champions were then provided with FP counselling job aids, short term FP commodities (pills, condoms and injectables) and community FP registers for documentation and reporting in the National Health Management Information System. To ensure compliance, acquisition of supplies, accountability and quality of FP services, each trained hotel staff was attached to the nearest health facility under the supervision and mentorship of the health facility family planning focal person</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Findings from the needs assessment revealed that over 80% participants were majorly aware of condoms and IUD methods, 90% hotel workers who reported to be using FP methods had accessed FP services at public health facilities at least once in six months because the services are free and are available. 100% staff reported full access to condoms at their workplaces at no cost because they are provided by the HIWA project consistently hence making the condoms popular among the hotel staff while the most prevalent challenges reported by hotel staff were low knowledge on FP (60%) and lack of time to go to the public health facilities (45%) due to the long working hours and restricted work schedules</p><p></p><p>During the practical sessions of the  training, the FP champions were able to reach a total of 356 clients with short term methods and these included 94 male condoms, 17 female condoms, 85 oral pills, 120 injectables, 23 counselled only and 73 referred for long active reversible methods.</p><p></p><p>In the next 2 weeks immediately that followed after the training, FP champions have reached 189 hotel staff in10 hotels with FP information through work based sensitization sessions. This has resulted in 40% (76/189) hotel staff receiving actual short term FP methods</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Workplace based family planning interventions provide key opportunity for employees to access timely cost-free services because they address challenges to access such as distance, cost and time. This should further be explored for other health services and neglected work places</p>",

      "title": "Workplace family planning interventions: expanding access to services for garment workers in Bangladesh",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Bangladesh, approximately 4 million young people work in 5,500 ready-made garment (RMG) factories. More than 85% of production workers are women. The mean age of female workers is 24.9 years, and 69% of them are currently married. Factories employing more than 300 workers are required by law to provide basic health care facilities staffed by qualified health personnel. Currently, many garment factories house a mini-clinic where a nurse, paramedic, or medical assistant, supported by a part-time doctor, provide preventive and limited curative care to workers. However, reproductive health concerns are not prioritized, and service providers are often not trained to address workers’ family planning (FP) and sexual and reproductive health needs. To improve workers’ access to FP information and services on factory premises, EngenderHealth Bangladesh, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)–funded Mayer Hashi II (MH-II) Project, implemented a service delivery strategy in selected garment factories in Dhaka and Chittagong. This paper highlights the experiences of the interventions, which will help researchers, program managers, and policy planners to develop and successfully implement such interventions in RMG factories to reach this underserved group—factory workers.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The MH-II Project implemented interventions for expanding access to FP for garment workers in 43 factories in Dhaka and 15 in Chittagong. Interventions included: (i) conducting FP educational sessions on factory premises for workers; (ii) providing short-acting FP methods from factory-based mini-clinics; and (iii) referring garment workers to out-of-factory facilities for long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and permanent methods (PMs). Before implementing these interventions, the project fostered the environment by (i) sensitizing stakeholders, (ii) establishing partnerships for contraceptive supplies and referrals with the government system, and (iii) selecting and training peer educators for reducing demand-side barriers and increasing follow-ups.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Interventions were implemented in two phases—first, beginning in February 2015 in 30 factories, and then in May 2016 in 28 factories. The project developed one workplace coordinator per factory and three peer educators per factory, by providing training on modern FP methods, benefits and side effects of LARCs/PMs, informed choice and volunteerism, gender issues, client screening, counseling techniques, sources of FP services, and referral linkages. Six months later, the workforce received a one-day refresher training.</p><p></p><p>Workplace coordinators, working with peer educators, conducted 45-minute educational sessions with groups of 30–35 workers at least once a week, using FP flipcharts and booklets. Mugs with key information on LARC/PM were distributed among workers for spousal communication. The project also introduced a system to broadcast FP messages using multimedia during the lunch break; these contained television commercials, documentaries, mini-dramas, and theme songs on FP and safe motherhood.</p><p></p><p>After the group sessions, peer educators talked with potential FP clients. Based on peer educators’ recommendations, the coordinator referred prospective FP clients to the mini-clinic or appropriate service facilities. Peer educators followed up with FP clients to understand their experiences. The project developed a monitoring and evaluation system and documented experience with the interventions.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>BGMEA, the trade association in Bangladesh representing the RGM industry, and EngenderHealth Bangladesh signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to allow for FP services to be provided at mini-clinics on factory premises. In addition, a separate tripartite MOU between the government, BGMEA, and EngenderHealth ensured a supply of short-acting methods from the Directorate General of Family Planning (DGFP) to the garment factories.</p><p></p><p>A total of 2,920 in-factory educational sessions were conducted (2,001 in Dhaka and 919 in Chittagong). Through these educational sessions, 88,169 factory workers (both married and unmarried) received information on modern FP methods and on referral facilities and services. Two-thirds of session attendees were female. To allow workers to attend sessions, factory management granted approximately 66,000 person-hours of workers’ time off. Factory management also did not charge the project for administrative and physical costs involved in using factory workers or premises for the educational sessions.</p><p></p><p>A total of 8,691 workers adopted FP methods from factory mini-clinics and designated referral facilities—5,668 obtained pills and condoms from factory mini-clinics, and 3,023 adopted injectables or LARCs/PMs from referral facilities. Of the method adopters, 39% chose the pill, 31% injectables, 26% condoms, and 4% LARCs/PMs.</p><p></p><p>The project was also successful in establishing functional linkages between 164 garment factories of Chittagong Export Promotion Zone (CEPZ) and the CEPZ hospital for providing FP services. As a result, 198,810 workers now have the opportunity to access FP services from the CEPZ hospital.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>MH-II’s workplace FP interventions increased access to FP information, commodities, and services, resulting in increased use of FP, primarily through four program inputs:</p><p>I.<strong>Peer-led demand-side interventions.</strong> Such educational sessions are a convenient, quick way of reaching a large number of young factory workers about FP.</p>\t<li><strong>Contraceptive supply. </strong>The partnership between the DGFP and BGMEA contributed to institutionalizing the provision of contraceptive supplies to the selected factory mini-clinics.</li>\t<li><strong>Special FP service delivery days</strong>. The project also organized special FP service delivery days at the factory premises, which ensured instant access to implants and injectables on the premises and linked clients to referral facilities for IUDs and PMs.</li>\t<li><strong>Functional linkages for LARCs/PMs. </strong>Referring factory workers interested in obtaining LARCs/PMs to nearby health facilities (BGMEA health centers, government facilities, and NGO clinics) made it easier for them to adopt their desired methods.</li><p></p><p>The government intends to expand FP services to the garment factories, and it included the provision of workplace FP services in its Operational Plan of the next sector program (2017-2021). To scale up the MH-II workplace FP interventions to a larger number of garment factories will require comprehensive planning and standard service delivery protocols for providing FP services. In addition, a coordinating body comprising the government, BGMEA, and participating NGOs should be established. Since the BGMEA will take the lead to implement the interventions, BGMEA’s technical skills, including, supervisory and monitoring capacity to implement the workplace FP interventions, need to be strengthened as well.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Blue Ventures (BV) is a UK-based NGO that began working in southwest Madagascar in 2003. Determined to help rebuild tropical fisheries with coastal communities, BV soon realized that meeting the unmet family planning needs of isolated communities was equally as important as protecting biological diversity. When the community health program began in 2007, minimal family planning services were available in the region. Women were unable to time and space their births and this resulted in poor maternal and child health outcomes, and prevented women’s participation in fisheries management and other income generating activities. The average household had six or seven children and  the regional contraceptive prevalence rate was 10%. In response to this need, for more than 10 years, BV has continued to integrate health services with fisheries and mangrove management, and aquaculture activities, seeing improvements in both human health and marine resource management. As a champion of the Population, Health, Environment (PHE) approach in Madagascar, BV now works across four regions of Madagascar and serves as evidence that PHE approaches can be replicated as effective solutions that achieve conservation and family planning goals and objectives.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>BV integrates family planning services with community-based natural resource management in order to address pertinent health and conservation needs and priorities for some of the hardest to reach communities along the western coast of Madagascar. This holistic approach enables BV staff to deliver integrated health and environment messages, and to seek out health partners who can offer additional technical expertise. BV provides community-based interventions and solutions by integrating  family planning services with fisheries, mangrove, and aquaculture interventions that improve human health, deliver economic benefits, and strengthen diverse marine ecosystems.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2007, BV started providing family planning services through small clinics in southwest Madagascar because no other family planning services were easily available. Today, in coordination with the government of Madagascar and other partners, BV supports a network of community health workers (CHWs) who provide health services across four regions of Madagascar and who are trained in short-acting methods of family planning and in the linkages between health and environment. Many CHWs are also involved in fisheries, mangrove, and aquaculture activities and deliver family planning messages and services for locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) and other into conservation program initiatives. Furthermore, BV collaborates with Marie Stopes Madagascar to provide long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) to some of the hardest to reach communities and also helps to support youth groups who receive integrated reproductive health and environment education. Family planning service delivery data is collected and reported by CHWs, government health centers, and youth groups, who help shape the community health program and ensure that interventions are tailored to community needs and priorities. Collaboration with government health centers provides additional family planning support and helps to strengthen health systems to provide both quality government and  community-based family planning services. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Through various partnerships, BV supports 72 CHWs who meet the various family planning and natural resource management needs of  over 45,000 people living in coastal and migrant fishing communities across four regions of Western Madagascar. CHW supervision and support is done in coordination with the government of Madagascar, two USAID-funded public health programs, and other health and development organizations already working in BV intervention zones. CHWs provided family planning services and education to over 50 coastal communities who are also involved in the management of 18 locally managed marine areas.  From 2017 to present, partnerships with Marie Stopes Madagascar have provided 670 implants and 139 IUDs resulting in over 2,310 Couple Years of Protection (CYP). Furthermore, 22 youth groups distribute more than 1,000 condoms each month and serve over 650 youth group members and more than 1,900 people from the community. In its entirety, the community health program has provided over 12,900 CYP across four regions of Madagascar since 2007. In the Atsimo Andrefana region the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) has risen from 10% in 2007 to over 50% in 2016 and the General Fertility Rate (GFR) has decreased from 178.1 to less than 90 in 2016. It is expected that increases in CPR and decreases of GFR will be achieved at other sites, but the census data is still being collected. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>With more than 10 years of integrated health and environment programing experience, BV’s results demonstrate that many organizations from different sectors are capable of improving community access to family planning. Additionally, any conservation organization can achieve significant family planning impacts whilst also strengthening the delivery and impact of their natural resource management initiatives and objectives. Through the adoption of cross-sector partnerships and by taking an integrated approach, organizations can increase family planning coverage, improve service delivery quality, and contribute to overall health systems strengthening, especially in remote locations where people have historically had limited access to family planning services. BV’s experiences illustrate the importance for both conservation and health organizations to search out and nurture cross-sector partnerships and to inspire environment organizations and conservation donors to become champions of family planning. Because PHE programmes are typically community led, it is important to learn from and examine the different models provided across BV’s four sites in Madagascar. Lessons learned can help other conservation organizations determine which vehicles of family planning service delivery  (i.e. CHWs, youth groups, health systems strengthening, etc.) will have the greatest impact with their organization and country context. One billion people live in a biodiversity hotspot; typically these communities have poorer access to family planning services. Replicating this approach could provide a valuable strategy for reaching the hardest to reach with vital family planning services. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Many people in rural Nepal are dependent on local forests for firewood, timber and water, as well as protection from landslides and floods. Over the past fifty years, however, many forests in Nepal have been destroyed or over-harvested, leaving many people without essential resources and more vulnerable to disasters. People are also vulnerable to climate change, which is advancing rapidly in the Himalayas. Common climate impacts include loss of agricultural productivity, dwindling water supplies, death, injury and damage from floods and landslides, and an increase in pests and disease.</p><p>Research shows that, very often, climate change exacerbates already existing challenges related to poverty, social exclusion and gender.Women, poor and marginalized people are therefore often disproportionately affected because they do not have the resources to withstand climate-related shocks, are often excluded from community decision-making processes, and do not have equitable access to natural resources. These contexts can also leave women vulnerable to gender-based violence. Furthermore, in certain cases these people may have poor access to social services including health care: for example, if they live in remote areas where government health services do not reach; or because of unofficial discrimination on the grounds of caste by health facility staff.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Program/best practices:</p><p>The goal of the USAID-funded Hariyo Ban (Green Forests) Program is to build community and ecosystem resilience in two large landscapes. The Program has worked with over 400 communities/local authorities to improve their forest management, strengthen livelihoods, and help people adapt to climate change. To begin working with a community, the program empowers women, poor and marginalized people through community learning and action centers (CLACs) to ensure both their active participation and benefit from tailored actions. Many interventions are gender and social inclusion focused, addressing the needs of communities in an integrated way across several disciplines, including health.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Program works in the Terai Arc Landscape and the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape in Nepal, which cover an area from the high Himalayas through the mid-hills to the low-lying Terai on the border with India. Components in the first phase were: biodiversity conservation; sustainable landscapes with a focus on climate mitigation through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration; and climate adaptation for people and nature. Cross-cutting themes were livelihoods, governance, and gender and social inclusion. The main human health links in this multi-disciplinary project have been through improved water supplies and sanitation; disaster risk reduction; reducing women’s work-loads; reducing indoor air pollution; improving nutrition; reducing gender-based violence; increasing awareness of health-climate change links; and improving access to health care services.</p><p></p><p>Data used here comes from the project monitoring system and covers the first phase of the project, from 2011 to 2016. The project was subsequently extended and is currently in a second phase, running until 2021. Intended beneficiaries include climate-vulnerable, forest-dependent communities in critical areas of the two landscapes, with a special focus on women, and poor, marginalized and indigenous people. The project’s first phase underwent mid-term and final evaluations by the donor and government respectively, using qualitative approaches.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The CLACs were found to provide a very valuable mechanism of ensuring that disadvantaged people and women could participate and benefit from the program. Having local resource people leading the adaptation planning process ensured that plans were appropriate and focused on local issues.</p><p>Community female health volunteers, involved in parallel population-health-environment projects, played an important role in raising awareness about climate change and climate vulnerability, helping design health-related interventions. It was found that, in some cases, women lacked information on family planning and access to health care facilities including family planning services; the Program raised awareness on reproductive health and built their capacity to successfully advocate for improved access. The Program also supported construction or improvement of foot trails in the hills and mountains, providing safer access to social services.</p><p>The Program also worked to reduce women’s work loads and improve their health. This included improved water supplies linked to better watershed management, reducing time spent collecting water and improving water quality. Work and time for collecting firewood was also reduced, through promotion of fuel-efficient stoves and alternative energy sources such as biogas and micro-hydro, which also reduced indoor air pollution and associated respiratory infections in women and young children. Sanitation was improved when household latrines were installed with biogas, reducing open defecation. Women also played a bigger role in forest management, enhancing their roles in communities and ensuring they shared in benefits from forests. Overall, more than 284,000 people benefited from the program in the first phase.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Integration, working with a multi-disciplinary approach, was an essential part of the Program’s success. This is particularly important with climate adaptation since vulnerability is very context-specific and varies from place to place. Integrating human health interventions was an important part of the Program.  In some cases, it provided entry points to other activities, gaining community buy-in (e.g. clean water supplies) and sometimes health benefits came through other sector activities (such as restoring forests through reducing firewood consumption).</p><p>It is not enough just to work at the local level to improve community health: working at different scales was essential for health needs such as ensuring clean water supplies from well managed watersheds and tackling disaster hazards like floods and landslides.  Additionally, having a good policy environment is essential to implement complex programs such as this. The Program was able to provide policy inputs in several fields.</p><p>Empowerment of women, poor and marginalized people was an essential early step to ensure they could effectively participate and benefit from the Program. However, working with women alone to promote gender-sensitive approaches was not enough, involvement of male leaders and champions was also necessary. One result was a marked change in attitude towards gender-based violence over the course of five years, and the Program was able to achieve some early successes in this field, working through natural resource management groups.</p><p>In light of future climate uncertainty, it is important to follow a flexible, no-regrets approach that can be adapted in the future without closing options.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The socio-economic and reproductive health situation in Ethiopia has improved in the past couple of years. The recent stride in the use of FP in the country has got international recognition with a doubling of users within five years. Despite the remarkable achievements made, the country still has many mothers dying from preventable and curable maternal complications unbalanced population growth complicated by local and international migration high unemployment rate of young people, climate change and land degradation posing significant negative effects on the development of the country. Given the complex problems in the country where large population size, low agricultural productivity and limited basic health care access are the major problems, it is mandatory and timely to ensure the well being of the community and the environment in a harmonized manner. In this regard, multi sectoral integrated Population Health and Environment (PHE) approach is key to address developmental challenges through joint action of all relevant stakeholders. According to a number of reports across the world, the PHE approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing unmet need for family planning in rural communities, empowering women and increasing the participation of men and the youth in family planning and health in general.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Making use of the project funds obtained from the David &amp; Lucile Packard Foundation, PHE Ethiopia Consortium implemented a project titled “Strengthen &amp; Scale up RH/FP intervention through multi sectoral PHE integrated approach” since 2014 in two districts. The objective of the project was to strengthen capacity, and improve partnership to achieve the population and reproductive health goals. This abstract highlights the major outcomes and learning’s of this intervention and the implications for future initiatives.  Major interventions includes establishment of multi sectoral taskforce, innovative community distribution through PHE providers, engaged in biological and biophysical soil and water conservation and livelihood</p>",
      "methodology": "<p> </p><p>The findings for this article are obtained from the final-term evaluation of the project, which was conducted by an independent consultant </p><p>The data collection tools employed for the evaluation include :survey of households through structured questionnaires, review of the project documents and other relevant secondary data sources,  focus group discussions (FGD), and interview of key informants . As the beneficiary size was 179 households in the targeted two districts, Metu 79 and Hurumu 100, about 27% of the sample size (numbering 50 HH) have been taken, out of the total 50 respondents, 40 (80%) were women while the remaining 10 (20%) were men. The sample HHs were randomly selected using the list of beneficiaries in the respective village as a sampling frame. FGDs were conducted in four villages of the two districts. A total of 20 project beneficiaries (25% female) involved in the discussions. Key Informant Interview (KII) was made with 22 beneficiaries and relevant local sectoral stakeholders who have important role and participated in project implementation. The primary quantitative data collected through the household survey were organized and analyzed using SPSS and Excel programs. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>As a result of the project intervention, the contraceptive acceptance rate of the Metu and Hurumu districts increased from 58, and 69 percent in 2014 to 76and 91 percent in 2017 respectively. Institutional delivery at health centers has also shown remarkable progress from 22, and 16 percent in 2014 to 42, and 29 percent in 2017 for Metu and Hurumu districts respectively. In addition, more than 105 women were organized in four credits and saving associations and 86 percent of women improved their livelihood through alternative income generation activities.  The introduction of fuel saving stoves resulted in a reduction in the time spent in fire wood collection by women by 71.4 percent and mitigated the health impacts of indoor air pollution. </p><p>To improve FP accessibility for the rural community, the project recruited rural shop owners to be <em>PHE providers</em>. These shop owners were intensively trained by the HEW Health Extension Workers on the provision of short term FP services (condoms and pills). These PHE providers have been found to complement the HEWs and are becoming the primary source of FP services when HEWs are not available. As a result of this strategy, one PHE provider has been able to support on average 10-20 short term FP users per month, which has contributed to reducing the unwanted pregnancy of the district from 12% to 2.5%.  In addition, evidence shows that youths who are not comfortable going to the health post use PHE providers as an alternative source of contraceptives.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p><strong>The four major lessons from the project are:</strong></p>\t<li>PHE integrated approach is effective for achieving FP and fertility outcomes:  It enhances women’s FP and fertility knowledge, attitude and practice and fosters knowledge to have lower desire for more children.</li>\t<li>PHE approach empowers women: the approach focused on the vulnerable groups particularly poor rural women. The improvements in income of the women have shifted from short acting to long acting FP methods.</li>\t<li>PHE integrated approach is an effective strategy for improving the multifaceted problems of the rural community, for livelihood diversification and income improvement.</li>\t<li>PHE multi sectoral integrated approach is more effective and efficient to address local development problems through a multi-disciplinary approach focusing on health (RH/FP, hygiene and sanitation) and natural resource management.</li>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Marico River Catchment is in the semi-arid North West Province of South Africa, where it forms the headwaters of the strategically important Limpopo River Basin. The agricultural livelihoods of the local marginalized rural communities living there depend on highly threatened water resources. Population pressures on these resources have grown, resulting in the community requesting the environmental organization already supporting local sustainable livelihood development, The Endangered Wildlife Trust, to also consider their reproductive health needs. This led to the partnership between the Endangered Wildlife Trust and Pathfinder International.</p><p></p><p>The region is beset by drought, lack of employment opportunities, and has the second highest fertility rate nationwide. Within the central town of Groot Marico the rate is higher still. This is due to a range of issues, from lack of knowledge of contraceptive options to structural barriers to family planning (FP) services. Women who are unable to determine if and when to have children are unable to retain sustainable livelihood opportunities, and a growing population exacerbates pressures on local water resources, resources on which the whole community depends. The community understood that their health, social, economic, and environmental challenges were linked, so they challenged the development sector to respond accordingly.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The intervention relies on the community understanding of the connections between health, social, economic, and environmental challenges, and the resulting need for a development intervention, which responds to that understanding. Responding solely to either the community’s health or livelihood needs cannot result in long-term community and health wellbeing, or a secure river catchment. The partnership of the Endangered Wildlife Trust and Pathfinder International aims to demonstrate that integrated projects can generate greater immediate and long-term outcomes than would have been possible by single sector development programming.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The particular site, in the Marico River Catchment, was selected for a cross-sector project because the community itself requested health as well as non-health activities. The project has been implemented over the past year, we have collected the interim results during the first 3 months of 2018 and this project will continue for the next three years. The size of the local population, and intended beneficiaries, is approximately 157,690.</p><p></p><p>Community education integrates messages on healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies and HIV prevention and treatment, with messages on local livelihoods, climate change and population issues. The theory is that barriers to discussion on any topic are removed by each topic being reduced to one element of many within the education curriculum. This method facilitates additional entry points for discussion, expanding the potential audience. The project also supported four health clinics and ensured that they were stocked with contraceptives and basic medical equipment such as BP machines and condom demonstration models.</p><p></p><p>Whilst community knowledge gained from education activities increased the demand for services, greater clinical capacity resulted from the training activities on contraceptive options, counselling, sexual and gender based violence (SGBV), and activities linked to “Values Clarification”.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The project has built the capacity of health care service providers to ensure their provision of long acting reversible contraceptives (IUDs and Implants), offer a better contraceptive method mix, and they can counsel clients on the benefits smaller families provide for their health and environment. The preliminary data shows an increase in the uptake of long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC). The integrated approach resulted in improved support for environmental conservation through trust developed by meeting the individual needs of the communities that are custodians of this strategically important water resource. This was enhanced by meeting the reproductive health needs of the communities. Conservation and sustainable development goals were met due to the extent of engagement with women. Female beneficiaries of the project were provided livelihood support, training, and a deeper understanding of how environmental health is linked to their health and wellbeing, while also meeting their SRH needs.</p><p></p><p>The partners jointly implemented activities at project sites, resulting in increased community engagement. This was demonstrated by increased participation at community meetings/events where family planning, SGBV, and conservation were discussed. In addition, the nurses at the clinics reported greater involvement of men in sexual and reproductive health issues. There was also an increased uptake of family planning services at the facilities within the catchment areas and an increased awareness among partners and beneficiaries of integrated linkages and the benefits of integration. Communities also engaged in critical dialogues generated about gender roles, sexuality, family planning, conservation and livelihoods.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "The value of the PHE approach in this project depended on the existing relationships that the Endangered Wildlife Trust had with community members, allowing Pathfinder staff to start implementing reproductive health interventions as soon as the necessary authorizations were received from the Department of Health. The EWT also worked closely with young men in the communities prior to the project, allowing for the necessary introductions required for Pathfinder to engage with a demographic they would not normally reach through clinical work.<p></p><p>The lessons learned include the need for cross training to recognize the shared values around human dignity and individual choice. Many conservation organizations do not communicate these values effectively enough, significantly jeopardizing potential projects. Conversely, it is critical for health organizations to integrate their communications and deliver a holistic and cohesive message around family planning and environmental conservation.</p><p></p><p>This is a complex cross-sectoral project, therefore requiring a diverse range of skills. It is the first time that the EWT has been involved with population and family planning, and the first time Pathfinder South Africa has been able to use climate, water, livelihood and broader PHE reasons for promoting family planning in South Africa. This project is highly significant to the partner organizations, to the regional health departments; to the communities we work with and to South Africa (as our site is the only South African PHE project).</p>",

Les approches adoptées étaient axées sur la responsabilisation de la communauté de base pour la gestion et la restauration des ressources naturelles, l’adoption de comportements sains et du reflexe environnemental, la promotion de la planification familiale, ainsi que le développement d’activités économiques alternatives. Sous l’impulsion des engagements du pays à la déclaration de Libreville (2008), le pays dispose depuis 2011 d’une politique nationale en santé et environnement.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Financé par USAID, JSI Research &amp; Training Institute,Inc. (JSI) a mis en œuvre depuis 2011 deux programmes intégrés de santé à base communautaire successifs dans 4.887 villages enclavés, éloignés des formations sanitaires, victimes d’aléas climatiques saisonniers, et abritant souvent une biodiversité à risque. Avec le Ministère de la Santé,  JSI a formé et équipé des agents communautaires, ou AC, volontaires,  sélectionnés par leur communauté de résidence. Certains ont aussi bénéficié de formation environnementale. Ils peuvent ainsi offrir des services intégrés de proximité de promotion, prévention, soins en santé de l’enfant, nutrition, paludisme, eau, assainissement et hygiène,  planification familiale et éducation</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Le programme vise une couverture équitable de tous les villages de sept sur 22 régions, répartis dans 456 communes et 34 districts, où vivent 23,3% de la population totale du pays. Les groupes vulnérables (enfants moins de cinq ans, jeunes, femmes enceintes, en âge reproductive) en constituent les cibles principaux. Le programme a développé des partenariats avec des ONG œuvrant pour la gestion des ressources naturelles et la conservation de la biodiversité marine ou forestière pour assurer une intégration des  interventions en santé, population et environnement. Les performances et impacts des interventions des ACs ont été mesurés par l’analyse de leurs données de routine, consignées dans leurs rapports d’activités mensuels et enregistrés électroniquement dans la base de données des districts sanitaires (GESIS). Trois évaluations indépendantes ont été effectuées en début de mise en œuvre des interventions (2012), à mi-parcours (2014), et en début du second programme (2016).  </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Parmi les 34 districts où le programme intervient, sept sur 10 (71%) sont localisés sur des zones côtières, trois sur cinq d’entre eux (58,8%) sont directement des lieux d’intérêt environnemental terrestre, et 0,3% limitrophes de ces zones environnementales. Le programme y a formé, entre  2012 et 2017, 5.206  AC (58%  sont des hommes). Au cours de la même période, ils ont recruté  512.497 nouvelles utilisatrices (1-2 nouvelles clientes par AC par mois). En même temps, ils ont traité jusqu’à 82% du nombre total de cas de paludisme simple qu’ils ont diagnostiqué, représentant la moitié des cas de fièvre chez les enfants de moins de de 5 ans qui sont venus voir les ACs.  Les résultats des évaluations ont montré que la prévalence contraceptive est passée de 26,9% en 2012 à 41,3% en 2014 et à 46,4% en 2016 (OMS), soit une augmentation moyenne annuelle de 3,9%  comparée au 2% pour l’ensemble du pays. Avec cette projection, la prévalence contraceptive devrait surpasser de 12 points de pourcentage  l’objectif 2020 de 50% auquel le pays s’est engagé, et amorcer un développement économique effectif à la base. Les besoins non satisfaits des femmes en âge de procréer en planification familiale ont par ailleurs accusé une baisse de près de la moitié des valeurs de 2014 en 2016 (30,6% à 17,3%). Une valeur moyenne de 98.838 grossesses inattendues serait évitée. En outre, le pays pourrait économiser  423.281 USD par an pour la seule vaccination des enfants.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>En mettant en place la Politique Nationale de Santé Communautaire (2009), Madagascar a préconisé entre autres la participation de la population aux activités de santé. Le transfert de taches des centres de santé de base aux AC pour accroitre la couverture universelle de l’utilisation de la planification familiale dans les communautés mal desservies est plus que probant. A travers cette approche, le programme ne peut qu’effectivement contribuer à l’atteinte des priorités nationales pour améliorer la santé maternelle, néonatale et infantile, par le biais de services intégrés de proximité, et l’intégration de la santé communautaire dans le système de santé conventionnelle. Les familles sont plus productives car disponibles et moins malades, les communautés de base se mobilisent et structurées dans la gestion rationnelle des ressources naturelles. L’intégration de la planification familiale représentant la partie Population dans les stratégies Santé Population Environnement  bénéficie à la fois les ressources naturelles, l’économie et la santé des familles, et par extension le développement économique régional. A l’échelle nationale, elle va davantage concourir à la couverture en santé universelle et ainsi devrait continuer à faire partie intégrante  de la stratégie nationale de santé et environnement. Au niveau international, c’est un exemple de réussite d’interventions intégrées SPE utilisant le modèle de partenariat où la communauté de base constitue la pièce centrale pour un développement local effectif.</p>",

      "title": "Integrating postabortion care and family planning and expanding uterine evacuation and contraceptive method choice in Zanzibar, Tanzania: a pre-post evaluation.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Postabortion care (PAC) prevents complications arising from abortion, both spontaneous and induced, that lead to maternal deaths, by providing emergency evacuation of retained products of conception from the uterus, additional treatment, if necessary, for severe complications (i.e. shock, sepsis, hemorrhage, etc.), and pre-discharge care and counseling which includes education on resumption of fertility, family planning (FP), and access to contraceptive methods. Furthermore, contraceptive service delivery is almost ubiquitously a weak component of treatment models. Since 2005, EngenderHealth has supported the Government of Tanzania in decentralizing PAC services in Tanzania. In 2015, with decentralization achieved in four regions, support focused on strengthening health systems to enable the provision of a wide variety of contraceptive methods to PAC clients, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), support the scale-up of effective models of PAC and FP integration, and generate knowledge that guides learning and dissemination of good practices.</p><p>Implimentation of the postaborion family planning project interventions  started from March 2016 to June 2018. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>EngenderHealth packaged systems improvements, training, cooperative learning, and client perspectives and implemented this via ‘cooperative inquiry groups’ (CIG), a participatory learning and action method. ‘Tier I’ CIG included MOH staff who assessed opportunities to improve PAC-FP integration and quality and drafted guidelines and management protocols. They oriented providers to these plans, forming ‘Tier II’ CIG at all facilities. The latter operationalized the guidelines and protocols and adapted training standards and curricula into onsite, team-based modalities for developing practitioners’ surgical PAC, mPAC, and FP competencies. ‘Tier II’ CIG organized periodic client interviews and incorporated clients’ and implementers’ perspectives into QI cycles. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A pre-post evaluation was conducted in 11 intervention facilities - 4 hospitals and 4 lower-level health centers, in Zanzibar. These facilities were selected because they met the client load criteria (at least 50 PAC clients per year) and were, thus, deemed appropriate for an intervention to improve the quality and integration of PAC. Structured client exit interviews were administered to all PAC clients who presented in the data collection period at each facility during the baseline (May to July 2016) and endline (January to March 2018) periods. Our objectives were to promote task shifting, increase method choice and service quality, increase access to PAC at lower-level facilities, and increase the uptake of postabortion FP.  Primary outcomes included the use of appropriate evacuation methods for treating complications, recall of counseling on evacuation methods, provision of pain management, recall of counseling on family planning, uptake of modern contraception by method type, and clients’ satisfaction with the services received. Outcomes were compared between baseline and endline for all facilities, using chi-square and t-tests to evaluate differences that emerged from the time before the intervention until after it has run for 1.5 years. For all analyses prior significance level was α =0.05</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Characteristics of clients enrolled in survey before (n=184) and after the intervention (n=188) are described. After the intervention, we found that there was an increase in the proportion of clients that obtained services from lower-level facilities from 32% at baseline to 51% after the intervention (p=0.001), and an increase in the proportion of clients that received care from a non-physician cadre (32% at baseline to 67% at endline, p=0.11). Concerning uterine evacuation methods, we found an increase in the use of mPAC for treating abortion complications (19% at baseline, 56% at endline, p=0.04), increase in recall of counseling on uterine evacuation methods (23% at baseline, 62% at endline, p=0.13); and a reduction in performance of D&amp;C (17% at baseline, 1% at endline, p=0.001). The proportion of clients that received pain management increased from 44% at baseline to 78% at endline (p=0.03). Uptake of modern contraception before discharge from PAC also increased during the period between the baseline from 11% of clients at baseline to 69% of clients at endline (p=0.001). (Uptake of LARC also increased during this period from 1% at baseline to 25% after the intervention (p=0.001). We constructed an overall client satisfaction score based on 12 Likert scale questions included in the baseline and endline surveys. These questions asked clients to rank their satisfaction with different domains of service quality (1=lowest, 4=highest). The mean clients satisfaction score also increased over the course of the intervention from 2.6 at baseline to 3.7 at endline (p=0.03). </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Our results indicate that the described approach to strengthening the provision of PAC, which included developing policy guidelines, management protocols, training, clinical mentoring and coaching and, and the incorporation of client feedback, introduced marked and manifold improvements in the quality of PAC, including clients’ decision to accept modern contraception- especially LARCs. Although promising, the intervention and evaluation described have limitations. Despite having observed a noteworthy increase in the volume of PAC cases handled at lower-level facilities, none of these included primary care facilities, which are nearest to communities, because of the above-mentioned ‘client load criteria’ for selecting intervention facilities. Furthermore, whereas we documented significant improvement in the uptake of postabortion contraception, specifically LARCs, this primarily owes to strengthened FP integration with MVA, while FP integration with mPAC did demonstrate significant progress. The participatory and multi-level nature of our approach enabled policy-level progress to translate to performance improvement and better outcomes; nevertheless, the geographic context and programmatic factors prevented us from comparing the outcomes of an intervention of this magnitude with those that might have occurred in a comparable setting that did not receive the intervention. Lastly, stakeholder consultation and qualitative research on the feasibility of delivering and sustaining this holistic approach at scale, especially at the primary care level, are important to guide the next phase of work. Nevertheless, our results inspire optimism that such progress is, indeed, feasible in Zanzibar, where strengthening PAC and postabortion FP services represents critical strides toward higher maternal survival.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p> Only 34% of currently married women and 21.6% of all women in Pakistan use modern contraceptive methods (Track20 2017).  The rate of unintended pregnancies is high, and many women facing unintended pregnancies resort to unsafe abortion (Naveed, Shaikh, and Nawaz 2016). In 2016, the use of modern methods of contraception averted an estimated 2,638,000 unintended pregnancies and 805,000 unsafe abortions (Track20 2017). According to WHO, fertility returns within 10 days after miscarriage or induced abortion and improved accessibility and use of contraceptives prevent 25–35% maternal deaths due to unwanted pregnancy (WHO 2007). Pakistan has high unmet need (20%) for family planning (FP). Postabortion contraception is a missed opportunity to interrupt the cycle of repeat unplanned pregnancy, particularly as part of the postabortion care (PAC).</p><p>Abortion-related stigma, providers’ biases, and the lack of clear policy and guidance and integration of postabortion family planning (PAFP) into health facility staff trainings and service delivery make PAFP inaccessible to women and girls in Pakistan. There is a critical need to better integrate contraceptive services at PAC facilities, improve the readiness of health facilities and improve the knowledge and skills of service providers in PAFP counseling and service provision.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To minimize missed opportunities, Ipas has emphasized the importance of postabortion contraception counseling and services. We provided technical assistance to teaching institutions and facilities for bringing contraception services into uterine evacuation (UE)/PAC procedure areas, as these services are often provided in separate areas or facilities in Pakistan. In addition, we worked with policy makers and provincial stakeholders for the integration of PAFP into the mandates of the provincial FP task forces, which initially had been limited to postpartum FP only.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Woman-centered PAC trainings conducted by Ipas were designed to increase health-care providers’ capacity to prescribe and provide PAFP and to ensure the continuous availability of contraceptive method mix. The focus was on informed choice and enabling women who would like to switch from short-acting contraceptives to long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) by providing seed supply to the PAC sites. To address myths and perceptions about abortion and family planning, Ipas also conducted abortion values clarification and attitude transformation (VCAT) workshops for health-care providers. After training, they were provided regular mentoring support during follow up and site visits. During these visits facility logbooks were collected showing client-level data on postabortion contraceptive uptake for all women receiving abortion care in the facility.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During 2011-2017, we helped to upgrade and support 192 PAC sites (133 hospitals and 59 clinics) and trained 545 service providers in VCAT, woman-centered PAC and family planning.  As the result of Ipas training and commodity support and follow up, 45,312 women were treated for uterine evacuation/PAC; of these 27,662 (61%) women accepted a modern contraceptive method. The majority of women (49%) received their contraceptive method at midlevel providers’ clinics, 33% from private sector hospitals/doctors' clinics, and 18% from public sector hospitals. Previously at these sites, women coming for PAC were not offered postabortion contraception services and were referred instead to family welfare centers.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>There is need for a clear postabortion family planning policy and guidelines and for integration of family planning services in health facilities, to ensure that women who approach a health facility for abortion/PAC are counseled and provided a contraceptive method, or are given a referral, in case contraceptives are not available at the health facility. There is also need to include PAC-FP indicators in the district health information system (DHIS) to capture contraceptive need and use at the health facility and avoid any stock outs.</p>",

The proportion of women age 15-19 who have begun childbearing rises rapidly with age, from 2 percent among women age 15 to 28 percent among those age 19. The most popular methods are injectables (23 percent), implants (8 percent), IUD, and the pill (2 percent each) (2016EDHS). Ethiopia is making progress in reducing maternal deaths in general by accessing FP, making pregnancy safe and abortion related in particular by putting in place laws , guidelines and enabling facilities and providers to provide comprehensive abortion care in all public and private facilities in the country.</p><p>Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE) provides comprehensive abortion care (CAC) as one of its SRH integrated service.</p><p>The post abortion periods are crucial times for information and counselling about prevention of unwanted pregnancy. The focus of this paper is linkage of Post abortion Long term FP to women received safe terminated care from FGAE experience. Since most women get in contact with the health care system during abortion care, these create the opportunity to counsel the women on use of contraceptive of their choice.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE) implemented CAC and FP services in an integrated approach through support of Global comprehensive abortion Care initiatives (GCACI) in 13FGAE SRH clinics. It was initiated in five clinics in 2010. The key intervention of GCACI is demand generation, capacity building, quality of care provision, data management, and performance monitoring and replication best practices to other clinics.  Women are counselled to use Post abortion FP to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia  is one of the National technical committee which is responsible to design, implement and monitor FP programs.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The National RH strategy is utilized for expansion and creating an integration SRH service. Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE) piloted to provide an integrated Comprehensive Abortion Care (CAC) and FP in five of its SRH clinics in 2010 by support of Global Comprehensive abortion Care Initiative (GCACI). It expanded to other 8SRH clinics. FGAE’s service providers are expected to give quality FP/SRH counselling, CAC and other Key SRH services in an integrated approach. Data are collected from 13 Health Facilities using standardized SRH data capturing tools, both electronic and manual. In 2017, the collected data used to analyze the level of FP service integration to CAC services. Comprehensive FP including quality counselling training was provided to service providers. Tailor message was developed and translated to local languages for increasing understanding among women, youth and community at large. Demand creation session was conducted to Youths, Women and other community influential groups. Ensuring integrated Quality of care and regular performance monitoring are done by the performance review and quality assurance team of head quarter, branch offices and 13 service delivery points. The best practices have been duplicated to other Non-GCACI supported health facilities and currently all 32 SRH clinics provide CAC</p>",

The proportion of Post abortion Long term FP from total post abortion FP users improved through provision quality training on VCAT, FP counselling, continuous mentoring and improved data management. Regular performance review and quality of care assessment improves the quality integrated service provision and client flow. The feedback from quality of care assessment finding helped the clinics to identify gaps, develop action plan and take action on time. The commitment of service providers also contributed to the success of the quality integrated SRH service provision. Use of tailor message on all Family planning choice and provision of quality FP counselling to all methods improved the Long Term Family Planning linkage.  Peer to peer education in various service outlets increased use of Long term FP among youth clients.</p>",

      "title": "Quality management of social franchise clinics: expanding access to post-abortion family planning ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Unmet need for contraception is one of many reasons that women need access to safe abortion care. Approximately 40% of pregnancies worldwide are unintended, because of ineffective or non-use of contraception, or method failure; half of these pregnancies result in abortion. Women accessing safe abortion care and post-abortion care are therefore an important group to offer family planning information and services, in order to reduce unmet need for contraception.</p><p>Contraceptive counselling and method choice is an important component of quality abortion care. The uptake of post-abortion contraception can be restricted by multiple factors, including facility-level barriers such as shortages of contraceptive methods or trained staff; provider-level barriers, such as lack of knowledge and denial of methods to certain groups; and client-level barriers, such as partner disapproval, and preferences or concerns about contraceptive methods. Although evidence suggests that contraceptive counselling in abortion care can reduce client-level barriers to post-abortion contraceptive uptake, little research has assessed approaches to remove provider-level barriers to effective counselling.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a quality management intervention on post-abortion family planning (PAFP) among private socially franchised providers. The quality management intervention comprised a one-day refresher orientation on PAFP, a counselling job-aide, and enhanced monthly supervision visits. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess whether PAFP and long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) uptake increased after the introduction of a quality management intervention in social franchise clinics in Western Kenya and (2) to understand the drivers and barriers experienced by providers and clients in the provision or use of PAFP.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted a pre- and post-intervention study between November 2015 and July 2016 in nine private clinics in Western Kenya. We conducted a baseline and post-intervention survey among clients of social franchise providers, using in-person interviews on the day of their procedure, and follow-up telephone interviews 14 days later. The post-intervention survey was collected 1 month after roll-out of the intervention was initiated. The primary outcome was the proportion of clients receiving any method of PAFP (excluding condoms) within 14 days of obtaining an abortion. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of clients receiving PAFP counselling, and the proportion of clients receiving LARC within 14 days. We used chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression to determine whether the intervention was associated with our outcomes, adjusting for potential confounding factors and clustering at the clinic level.</p><p>We also conducted semi-structured interviews with nine providers, gathering information on the providers’ experience and perceptions of the intervention. Semi-structured interviews with clients were conducted to explore abortion-seeking behaviour and decision-making, abortion experience, use and knowledge of contraception, experience of PAFP counselling, and perceived facilitators of and barriers to family planning use post-abortion.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Interviews were completed with 400 women at baseline and with 369 women post-intervention. The 14 day follow-up rate was higher at baseline (60%) than post-intervention (48%).</p><p>Same-day PAFP uptake was higher post-intervention (19.3% vs 30.8%), as was same-day LARC uptake (12.6% vs 19.5%). After adjusting for clustering and potential confounding factors, the intervention had a significant effect on same-day PAFP (aOR 1.94, p<p>Clients’ reports of quality of counselling and satisfaction with services increased post-intervention. A greater proportion of women reported that the provider asked which methods they had used before (58% vs 71%, p<p>Providers reported mixed opinions about the intervention but felt that the supervision visits were most helpful for improving the quality of their services through continuous reminders. In semi-structured interviews, most women reported that PAFP counselling had been received and valued, though some wished for information on more contraceptive methods and their side effects. Women often needed time to consider their options, discuss contraception with their partner, or complete the abortion process before deciding about family planning methods.</p></p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results suggest that the intervention was successful in shifting provider behaviour towards higher quality PAFP counselling, and in increasing provision of post-abortion contraception. The in-depth interviews suggest that the supervision visits may have been the most effective components of the intervention, in continuously reminding and encouraging providers to maintain quality. Previous research in sexual and reproductive health has also found supervision to be an important component of quality improvement. Incorporating supportive supervision into management of clinics and providers may improve the quality of post-abortion contraceptive counselling and expand access to effective contraceptive methods. Supportive supervision and increased performance management may also have positive effects on other aspects of quality, though further evidence and evaluation is needed.</p><p>This study also found that even when provider and facility level barriers to provision of PAFP are removed, women may choose not to take a family planning method. In our study, women sometimes preferred not to make a decision on the day of the abortion procedure, because they wanted time to physically or emotionally recover from their abortion, or to consult with their partner. Services must therefore find ways to support women after they leave the clinic, for example through post-service reminders delivered by mobile phone, in-person or other media.</p>",

      "title": "Fertility decline in East Africa - projecting changes on youth demographics, prospects for the demographic dividend, and implications for development planning ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Around 20% of the 127 million people in the East African nations of Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania are between the ages of 15 and 24 years and can be labelled as “youth” according to the United Nations definition. In the last population and housing censuses in the four countries, about 40% of the Rwandese population were children below the age of 15, and the corresponding percentages were 43% in Kenya, 45% in Tanzania, and 52% in Uganda.</p><p>Such youthful population, if healthy, skilled, and gainfully employed, can be a catalyst for accelerated social and economic development. When the ratio of the working-age population to dependents increases significantly, the window of opportunity opens to harness the demographic dividend. However, the demographic dividend is not automatic. Firstly, a slow pace of fertility decline is insufficient to open the window of opportunity since the ratio of the working-age population to young dependents will continue to be unfavourable. Secondly, even with rapid declines in fertility and child mortality, countries can squander away the opportunity if they do not invest in human capital and create an enabling environment for savings, investments, and creation of jobs. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Given the pace of fertility decline in East African countries, what are implications of expected changes in youth demographics on the prospects of the demographic dividend in the region, and the short, medium, and long-term projected needs for basic and critical social services (including schooling, reproductive health and jobs) to cope with the future youth and working-age population trends in the region?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Our analysis is based on data from four countries in East Africa: Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The data were drawn from the national sources including the Demographic and Health Surveys, National Population Projections and Economic Surveys, and the UN Population Projections (the 2017 Revision). We used the open cohort component (CC) projections approach. The target population was young males and females aged 15-24 and country-specific age-ranges that define “youth”. The projection period is 2015-2065, to include short (2020), medium (2030) and long-term (2050 &amp; 2065) trends. We derived a set of scenarios, making assumptions based on comparative historical fertility and mortality decline observed in South East Asian countries particularly South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia where the demographic dividend has occurred. We developed an <strong>accelerated model</strong> scenario which we compare to the UN medium and low variant scenarios. The accelerated model assumes that greater investment in education, family planning and health services can shift the age-patterns of fertility which in turn accelerate overall fertility decline towards replacement level and increases the survival of the population across different age groups. The projections were then used to assess the implications for the demographic dividend and for planning for future social services needs.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We project a significant increase in the population for the next 30-50 years, <em>irrespective</em> of the scenarios. Except for Rwanda, none of the other EAC countries will reach replacement level fertility by 2065 under the medium variant scenario. Under the Accelerated model, the most realistic scenario is that only Rwanda and Kenya will reach replacement level fertility by 2065, eroding near-term prospects for the demographic dividend.</p><p>Between 2015 and 2065, the secondary school age population in Tanzania will more than double from 4.8 to 14.2 million under the medium variant or to 9.7 million under the accelerated model. In Uganda, the secondary school age population will increase from 5.8 to 16.2 million under the medium variant or to 13.4 million under the accelerated model. In Kenya and Rwanda, there will be declines in the school-age population by 2050.   </p><p>The total demand for contraception among sexually active female youth (married and unmarried) will increase significantly. For example, in Rwanda, among the female youth 15-19 years, the demand for contraception will grow more than 8-fold by 2065, from 35,000 women in 2015 to over 331,000. In Uganda among young females age 30-34, the demand will rise almost four times from 805,000 women in 2015 to 3.9 million by 2065.</p><p>Finally, if the levels of employment, school enrolment, and training remain the same, the projected share young people who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) in East Africa will increase from 9.8 million to nearly 23 million by 2050.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study sharpens the focus on realities faced by the East African nations to harness the demographic dividend. Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, contribute about 10% of the population in Africa. High fertility in the region is contributing to significant population growth which may impede economic development unless the countries address the rapid population growth and invest in the human capital of the current youth cohorts.</p><p>The prospects of harnessing a sizeable demographic dividend in EAC are low because the countries have high child dependency burden, but the recent transition to lower fertility in the region, coupled with falling childhood mortality rates, offer an opportunity for accelerated economic growth in the region. This will however only be achieved if the countries increase investments in human capital, reproductive health and family planning, creating an enabling economic environment that spurs growth of jobs, and good governance and accountability for equitable development.</p><p>We have demonstrated that significant resources will be required over the next couple of decades to meet the needs of basic services for young people for schooling and health while the rate of job creation has to improve significantly to absorb the growing working age population. The consequences of inaction or disinvestment include the countries getting stuck in a poverty trap, disenchanted youth, weak economic growth, and threats to the security of the region and beyond. Moreover, emerging evidence shows that high youth population growth and unemployment are associated with increased insecurity, social unrest and disorder, especially in urban areas. </p>",

      "title": "Fertility, Population Growth and the Economic Impacts of Child Marriage",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>While recent trends suggest a global decline in child marriage, more than 12 million girls are still forced into marriage before they turn 18 each year, and child marriage prevalence rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world.[1] The evidence base regarding the drivers and consequences of child marriage is expanding, with growing understanding that, for example: girls who marry early have little decision-making power within the marital home, particularly around reproductive health and family planning decision-making; and that when girls marry early, they often leave school, may face serious health complications and death from early pregnancy and childbearing, may have higher rates of depression, and are placed at higher risk of sexually-transmitted infections and intimate partner violence.</p><p>But while there is a growing evidence base documenting the consequences of child marriage, there has been, until recently, little in the way of rigorous assessment of the economic impacts of child marriage, or how much child marriage may “cost” countries and societies. ICRW and the World Bank recently concluded a rigorous three-year mixed-methods global study that aimed to provide this evidence base.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main question the study sought to answer was: What are the pathways through which child marriage results in economic costs, from the individual to global levels?</p><p>While the study addressed costs across five domains: Fertility and Population Growth; Educational Attainment and Learning; Labor Force Participation; Participation, Decision-making and Investments; and Health, Nutrition and Violence, this particular presentation will focus on the costs associated with early pregnancy, high fertility and associated population growth, as this has particular relevance for discussions of the returns on investment in family planning and the “demographic dividend.”</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We undertook a comprehensive literature review and developed a conceptual framework to define the pathways through which child marriage impacts a range of outcomes. We then analyzed a range of large data sets (including DHS, LSMS, national censuses and other surveys) using various econometric and modeling techniques to develop estimates of the economic costs of child marriage. The study focused mainly on 15 to 25 countries depending on the topic being considered for analysis. In some cases, extrapolations were carried for more than 100 countries. The core 15 countries for which most estimations were conducted include three countries from South Asia, one from the Middle East, six from West and Central Africa, and five from East and Southern Africa.</p><p>To supplement these analyses and provide additional understandings of the range of impacts of child marriage, we collected primary data through nationally representative household surveys in Ethiopia and Nepal, and extensive qualitative research in Ethiopia, Nepal and Niger.</p><p>For this presentation, we will present quantitative and qualitative results pertaining specifically to the impacts of child marriage on fertility, reproductive decision-making and population growth, and discuss their implications for costs and for ending child marriage and expanding access to SRHR for adolescents and youth.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Child marriage has large impacts on early childbearing and on total fertility rates (TFR). Marrying under the age of 18 increases TFR by an average of 17-26 percent in the core countries as compared to marrying at or above age 18. At the household level, this higher fertility can lead to impacts for child brides and their families through increasing household size, thus reducing the availability of funds to pay for food, education, health care and other expenses for each household member. It can also affect how women use their time.</p><p>Ending child marriage would reduce TFR in the core study countries by an average of 11 percent by 2030, which would have significant implications for population growth rates. By 2030, the population of many of the study countries would be reduced by two percent or more if child marriage were ended immediately and there was no associated increase in births to unmarried adolescents. This would have significant positive effects on national budgets and welfare. Specifically, per capita GDP would increase, as resources would be distributed among a smaller pool of people than if child marriage continued at current levels.</p><p>The estimated global benefit by 2030 to ending child marriage now is more than $500 billion (in purchasing power terms). These benefits would disproportionately reach poorer households and countries. Further, governments of countries most affected by child marriage could save billions of dollars each year from reduced population growth, simply through savings related to providing public education and other services.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study rigorously documents the economic costs of child marriage across a range of pathways and sectors and suggests that countries face massive costs from not acting to end child marriage, and potentially significant savings from eliminating it. Ending child marriage and associated early childbirths can improve health and welfare at the individual, household and population levels, and can increase productivity and enhance the opportunity to realize the gains in a country’s economic growth that can result from declining birth rates and a shifting population age structure, commonly referred to as the ‘demographic dividend.’</p><p>In addition to overall welfare benefits, eliminating child marriage and early childbirths should result in substantial budget savings for governments, as the slower population growth that would result would mean less pressure on governments to provide a range of public services.</p><p>As findings from this groundbreaking study are disseminated to key stakeholders globally, they have the potential to support advocates and policymakers in their efforts to increase financial resources and political will to end child marriage. At the same time, the study underscores the need to tackle social norms related to child marriage and adolescent sexuality, and to provide adolescents with access to comprehensive sexuality education and adolescent-friendly reproductive health information and services as critical ways to ensure that adolescents know their rights, can access services, and do not face unintended pregnancies, within or outside of marriage.</p>",

      "title": "Risk of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and diarrhea in children conceived through unintended pregnancy in India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally more than 40% pregnancies result in unintended pregnancies every year and nearly half of all reproductive-aged women in developing countries want to avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy intention is an important determinant of short and long-term consequences in children. Past studies showed that women with unintended pregnancy are less likely to receive antenatal care and consume iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. Such pregnancies can end with pre-term birth, low birth weight (LBW), and infant deaths. Few studies also reported that impaired health, lower cognitive development and educational attainment among unintended births.</p><p>The significant incidence of unintended pregnancy raises many challenges to reproductive and child health in India. The children conceived through unintended pregnancy are less likely to receive adequate newborn and neonatal care and recommended immunization. These children can develop weak and immature immunity and decreased natural defense. As a result, the unintended children can suffer from serious and life-threatening childhood morbidities, e.g., pneumonia and diarrhea. Strikingly India also has the highest prevalence of infant and child deaths associated with pneumonia and diarrhea in the world. Globally both diseases are leading causes of infant and child mortality and every year account for 1.4 million child deaths.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In the Indian context, past studies typically emphasized on pre-term birth, LBW, neonatal-infant mortality, child immunization and cognitive development in investigating the effect of pregnancy intendedness on child outcome. But there is clear lack of evidence of linkages between unintended pregnancy and pneumonia and diarrhea, except one study indicating risk of diarrhea among unplanned births in developing countries (including India). Given the striking incidence of unintended pregnancy and child deaths associated with pneumonia and diarrhea in India, the study aims to investigate the association between unintended births and childhood ARI and diarrhea after adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factor.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study is cross-sectional and based on the most recent data from the fourth round of a nationally-representative population-based cross-sectional National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2015-16 in India. The analysis in the study includes only youngest under five children born in reference time of the survey. Hence the analytical sample size is 190898.</p><p>The exposure variable is unintended birth, and outcome variables are ARI and diarrhea. The study includes age, sex and birth size of child, and breastfeeding initiation after birth, bottle feeding, mother’s education and mass media exposure, religion, caste, household wealth status and place of residence as control variables. The control variables also include environmental factors as cooking fuel, separate household kitchen and household member’s smoking for ARI and toilet facility and drinking water source and treatment for diarrhea.</p><p>We estimated the magnitude of unintended births among all births in the five years before the survey to women age 15-49. We also determined the two-week period prevalence of ARI and diarrhea in under-five children. We used two separate multivariable binary logistic regression models to investigate the association between unintended births and childhood ARI and diarrhea. The logistic regression models also include socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The prevalence of unintended births in the five years preceding the survey was 9% (9%; 95% CI: 8.9-9.4) in India. The uneducated mothers and those not exposed to mass media, age at birth 25 to 49 years, belonged to other religion, rural area and poor households reported higher unintended births. The unintended births were also higher among four and above birth ordered children and female children.</p><p>The overall prevalence of ARI and diarrhea in the last two weeks of the survey was 3 (3%; 95% CI: 2.9-3.2) and 11 (11%; 95% CI: 10.3-11%) percent respectively in India. The prevalence of ARI and diarrhea was considerably higher in unintended children. While 4% (4%; 95% CI: 4-4.9) unintended children had ARI, 15% suffered from diarrhea (15%; 95% CI: 14-16). The ARI was higher in unintended male children, and those belonged to a rural area. The prevalence of diarrhea was higher among unintended female children.</p><p>In multivariable binary logistic regression, the ARI and diarrhea were significantly associated with unintended births in India. The unintended children were 1.5 times (AOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.6) as likely as intended children to suffer from ARI. Similarly, the risk of diarrhea was 1.5 times (AOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.4-1.6) higher in unintended children than their counterparts. We also found several socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors were significantly associated with ARI and diarrhea in children.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our study is the first, perhaps, to investigate the association between unintended births and childhood ARI and diarrhea in India. The study uses the most recent large-scale nationally-representative population-based NFHS-4 data for this purpose. Overall 9% births were reported as unintended by mothers in India. Several socioeconomic and demographic factors affected the prevalence of unintended births. Our study also confirms the association between unintended births and ARI and diarrhea in children. The unintended children were more likely to suffer from both ARI and diarrhea than intended children. The association between unintended births and ARI and diarrhea in children was independent of socioeconomic, demographic and environmental confounding factors.</p><p>Our study has important policy implications. Our findings suggest the adoption of an integrated approach in family planning program with reproductive and child health (RCH) programs is necessary for India. The integrated approach to family planning and RCH program can significantly save both unintended pregnancies and newborn and infant lives. The programs should promote and make available cost-effective family planning methods to women of reproductive age to avoid unintended pregnancies. The family planning and RCH programs make active use of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities and mass media regarding ill-effects of unintended pregnancy on infant and child health. Frontline health workers must educate women regarding family planning methods and need to identify women with unintended pregnancy. The workers should encourage those women for regular pre and post-natal care, newborn and neonatal care and child immunization.</p>",

      "title": "Understanding the needs of adolescents for setting up the priorities for investments in family planning: Global trends from a demographer’s perspective",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In recent years there has been renewed interest in ensuring adolescents and young women have access to the information and services they need to realize their sexual and reproductive health and rights. The implications of an unintended pregnancy are more severe for a young women in terms of health, educational and long-term outcomes and the events and experiences in adolescent years carry forward with individuals into later stages of their lives, making this a potentially critical time for intervention.</p><p>The changing age structure following fertility decline can result in benefits to the economy, employment, environment, and human capital, so long as there is the right investment. This is known as the demographic dividend. The right investments in adolescents should take into account the diverse demographic patterns of adolescent populations. Whether the countries are subjected to the continuing fast growth of adolescent population or whether the adolescent population is at or behind its peak numbers, whether there are high proportions of adolescents who are married and adolescent birth rates are high, or whether there is demand for family planning that is not satisfied are crucial information for understanding the needs of adolescents and setting up the priorities for investments.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This paper sets the global perspective for a discussion on the demographic dividend, return on investment of family planning, and adolescent women. The findings are important to keep in mind for those investing in adolescents in order to achieve a changed age structure and to invest in youth and human capital and reap the benefits of the changed age structure.  The low and middle-income countries are very diverse in the terms of future population growth of adolescents, the proportion of adolescents who are married or in-union, adolescent childbearing and family planning demand and contraceptive use. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In this paper, we draw upon the 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects (WPP) (United Nations Population Division, 2017a). to provide an overview of trends in the global female population and age-specific fertility rates, with a special focus on adolescent women (age 15-19) and analyze trends in the proportion of women who are married or in a union among women aged 15-19 (United Nations Population Division, 2018).  We also analyze data on family planning indicators amongst women age 15-19 (United Nations Population Division 2017b) and assess the relationship of adolescent fertility to unmet need for family planning. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The size of the global female population aged 15-19 reached its historical peak around 2005. It is lower today than it was ~13 years ago, mainly driven by China’s dramatic fertility declines. However, this population of female adolescents will continue to grow in the future, maximizing in size around 2060. Expected changes until 2030 in the absolute size of the 15-19 age group will be largest in the countries categorized as low income (particularly in Africa) and lower-middle income, which has implications for where investment is most needed for family planning. There is very little uncertainty around this, because those who will be adolescents in 2030 are already alive today. There is greater uncertainty as we look towards 2100, because of more uncertainty around future fertility trends.</p><p>Adolescent birth rate has declined everywhere, but remains high in low income countries, and is projected to continue to decline. However, adolescent birth rate is lower than birth rates in older age groups everywhere, as fertility peaks in later years (in low-income countries in age group 25-29).  High adolescent birth rates are associated with high unmet need for family planning among 15-19-year-old females (married &amp; unmarried combined), suggesting that much adolescent childbearing is unintended.</p><p>Despite the declines over time in the proportion of adolescents that are married/in-union, more than a quarter of women are married/in-union in a number of low-income countries (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa), which has important implications for family planning use and estimates of fertility.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The renewed interest and commitment to adolescent sexual and reproductive health is applaudable. However, it is important to keep in mind demographic trends, when considering how best to serve women across all ages. Ensuring that young women have access to family planning services in order to avoid unintended pregnancy may help to achieve a changed age structure. Additionally, at the population level, the elimination of child marriages and expanding access to sexual and reproductive health information and services among adolescents will lead to reductions of adolescent childbearing and period measures of total fertility leading to faster declines of the number of births in the population.</p><p>But further to that, there have been misconceptions about when the global adolescent population peaks, where in the world the growth in adolescents will be, in which age-group fertility rates are highest, and in which age groups there are the highest unmet needs for family planning. It is important to know the population trends of the future, to better understand who will need to be served, most especially in order to reap the benefits of a changed age structure, in terms of investment in human capital. The analysis presented here will provide such information by presenting global, regional and national population estimates and projections, and fertility, marriage and demand for family planning trends.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>More than 60% population of UP is under-30 years of age, yet young voices are less heard, particularly in the context of youth’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) - like what kind of services are made available to youth is legally, socially, culturally, economically, accessible and what gets missed out. Young people are “not supposed” to have sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs, and there is a range of deepseated social and cultural taboos that make it even more difficult to obtain SRH services even if it is available and accessible at Adolescent Friendly Health Clinic (AFHC). Young voices need to be recognised more in SRHR context, and youth should be meaningfully engaged in SRHR policy frameworks, programmes, and in service delivery at all levels. Until, we enhance meaningful participation of youth, it will remain difficult to obtain sustainable, positive impacts and youth-focused SRHR outcomes.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The intervention aims to increase the visibility of SRHR needs of young people and to foster youth led documentation of young voices, perspectives and opinions in line with those of exerts healthcare providers, and practices and ground realities on youth SRHR, to secure improved outcomes in sexuality and reproductive health. Citizen News Service (CNS) with support from Youth Champion Initiative (YCI) mobilized a group of under-30 correspondents to train them on journalism skills and provide knowledge on a range of SRHR related issues to help them develop their articles focused. Articles were widely disseminated and shared with government agencies also.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In July 2015 CNS in association with civil society partners identified a group of 12 young correspondents to document youth voices related to SRHR and issues relevant for them in the state for one year.  The selected under-30 youth correspondents were given hands on experience to (i) write news articles, (ii) learn basic photography and video recording skills, (iii) interview experts and affected communities (iv) use social media tools, among other journalism skills through a week long comprehensive training workshop. A range of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) related issues were discussed in detail to help the correspondents develop their articles focused. Correspondents wrote a thematic news article each month focusing on issues like sex education, youth SRH services, child marriage, menstrual hygiene, family planning, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) etc. and documented ground realities and challenges along with suggestions to overcome them. These articles were widely syndicated through CNS syndication network to get them published in many prints and online media, and were also shared on social media and were shared with government health departments such as National Health Mission, Health and Family Welfare and Health Directorate etc. to increase the impact an outcomes.        </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The under-30 youth correspondents team had produced nearly 60 news articles, including videos, on youth SRHR issues such as access to quality SRHR services, sex education, menstrual hygiene, sexually transmitted infections like HIV/AIDS, early child marriage, family planning and SRHR related SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). The correspondent team also prepared a set of recommendations based on their field visit experiences, observations, and interaction with experts, care providers and affected communities. The recommendation were submitted to the concern government’s officials and departments such as National Health Mission, SIPSA, Health and Family Welfare Department, Rural Development, and Panchayati Raj Department and education department among others, for their cognizance, who assured the correspondents team to incorporate the recommendations in their PIPs as well. The correspondent team observed that lack of Inter-sectorial coordination as a major problem that hinders the overall outcomes of SRHR related programmes in the state. So, with support from YCI, a state level inter-sectorial coordination meeting was organized to share the learnings of the project and to accelerate the action for improving the outcomes of youth SRHR programmes.    </p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p>Training:  http://bit.ly/cns-young-photos </p><p>Hindi articles: http://bit.ly/cns-young-hindi</p><p>English articles: http://bit.ly/cns-young-english </p><p>Videos: http://bit.ly/cns-young-videos  </p><p>      </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>China’s abortion rate is much higher than other countries. Approximately 13 million induce abortions performed in China per year, accounting to 1/6 of the total number of the world. Further, near half of those abortions were performed among young females less than 25 years old. In China, around 48 million people, or 1 in 7 of childbearing age population, are girls aged 15 to 19. They were exposed to reproductive health risk, including unintended pregnancy and artificial abortion, for now and the next 30 years or even longer. Long leak time, with adolescents’ the poor compliance to contraception, make for a high risk of repeated abortions among Chinese females. Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal implants, are not user-dependent and have very low failure rates (less than 1%), which were recommend by the World Health Organization and other professional health organizations from all over the world as a first line of defense for teens looking to prevent pregnancy. However, very few Chinese teenagers use LARC methods. China’s abortion rate is much higher than other countries. Approximately 13 million induce abortions performed in China per year, accounting to 1/6 of the total number of the world.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Chinese 15-19 years old adolescents, including those who have had induced abortion, had an extremely low rate of LARC use.

      "methodology": "<p>Recruitment is conducted at 50 institutions that provide abortion services throughout the country from 06.16.2017 to 12.31.2017. 15-19 year-olds girls who come to seek abortion after an unexpected pregnancy are recruited. We conducted a questionnaire survey before she started an abortion and received family planning counseling services. The content of the questionnaire includes participants’ ages, education level, employment status, living area, current sexual activity frequency, recent family planning, previous contraception use, times of abortion and so on. The participants were also asked about whether they had heard about LARC, and whether they want to learn more about LARC, and their attitude towards LARC use at present and in the future. We evaluated the association of age, current sexual activity frequency. Etc. and preference for a LARC vs. a non LARC method.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The average age of all the 822 adolescents enrolled was 17.81±1.103. Of all the participants, 79.1% (n=650) were at first-time abortions, 17.3% (n=142) were through second-time abortions, and 3.6% (n=30) were during third or more than third-time abortions. The total repeated abortion rate was 20.9% (n=172). 59.5% (n=489) of the all the respondents had not heard of any LARC before. Of the 333 respondents who had heard about LARC before, 56.8% (n=189) said they were considering or had considered using LARC. The reasons for their refusal or misgiving about using LARC are mainly: worried about LARC may lead to infertility (52.4%, n=99); believing LARC is unnecessary for them since they don’t have regular sex life (29.6%, n=56); thinking LARC is only for married woman, unmarried girl who use LARC will be reproached by others (18.0%, n=34). When been asked if they want to know more information of about LARC, 55.5% (n=456) of all the 822 respondents answered in the affirmative. In multivariable analyses adjusting for key demographic characteristics, the strongest associations with LARC awareness were having received any form of sex education (adjusted OR 1.7) and living in urban (adjusted OR 1.6); the strongest associations with LARC acceptance were repeat abortion (adjusted OR 1.9), having regular sex life (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 1.2–1.7), and unemployment (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 1.1–1.7).  School adolescents were less likely to consider using LARC than their counterparts (all p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study, for the first time, present the awareness, cognition and attitude towards LARC of 15-19 year-olds Chinese adolescents who are seeking induced abortion, also founding that greatest barrier for promoting the use of LARC in 15-19 years old adolescents is deficiency of objective, scientific information about LARC. Most (55.5%)15-19 year-olds abortion patients have a positive attitude toward LARC, they would like to know more about LARC, even only few of them were considering to use one. Adolescents who having an abortion history before, or having regular sex life or were under unemployment status, were more likely to consider using LARC.</p><p></p><p>Health workers should pay close attention to adolescent patients. All the conclusions above suggest that 15-19 year-olds adolescents are holding open attitude toward LARC information now. If providing an intuitive, objective, scientific decision making information, LARC could become one important option for them to avoid unintended pregnancy.</p>",

      "title": "Current Status of Adolescent Reproductive Health in Indonesia: Findings from a Qualitative Study across nine provinces",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Currently, there are a lack of national-scale studies detailing the implications of the current adolescent reproductive health (ARH) policy and programming landscape from the perspective of adolescents, their parents, and key stakeholders.   </p><p>This study was designed to collect comprehensive evidence from 10-19 year-old adolescents, the parents of 10-14 year-olds, and key stakeholders working in adolescent reproductive health (ARH). Data were collected in nine provinces in Indonesia representing a cross section of urban and rural, male and female, primarily in-school youth. The study examines the effect and reach of sexual and reproductive health programs targeted to unmarried adolescents aged 10-19 years as well as their attitudes, knowledge and sources of information on reproductive health.  The parents of the 10-14 age study cohort and key stakeholders were interviewed to better understand the social landscape surrounding ARH. Overall, the study assesses the needs of the adolescents, considering also the influence from parents, service providers and key decision makers. It concludes by identifying considerations and strategies to increase the fulfillment of rights and access to sexual and reproductive health services for unmarried adolescents.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What is the current knowledge, attitudes and practices of unmarried adolescents 10-19 years in Indonesia with regard to sexual and reproductive health?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This research employed in-depth interviews, semi-structured interviews using vignette questionnaires, and focus group discussions (FGDs). The study population included four groups. One study cohort consisted of seventy-two (72) male and female young adolescents, aged 10-14 years. The young adolescents were interviewed using a vignette (projection) technique based on the instruments used for the Global Early Adolescents Study.  The second study population included interviews with parents of the 10-14 year olds, totaling 144 adults. Thirty-six (36) focus group discussions were conducted with 288 male and female adolescents, ages 15-19. The fourth study population consisted of 200 national and local government stakeholders, NGO staff, community and religious leaders, teachers and counselors, and midwives. The data were collected from the end of January 2017 until mid-April 2017.</p><p>The study was conducted in 18 urban and periurban/rural districts within nine provinces spread across the Indonesian archipelago.  The provinces were divided into high and low performing based on the national standard of childbearing and average age at marriage among 15‐19 year old women. The high performing provinces were West Sumatra, Yogyakarta Special Region, Bali and East Nusa Tenggara, and the low performing were Jambi, East Java, West Kalimantan, North Sulawesi and Papua were chosen.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The study found a gap between the reproductive health (RH) knowledge of adolescents and the parent’s perception on the adolescent’s knowledge . Young adolescents tend to seek RH information from their parents, while 15-19 year olds prefer to seek information from their peers and the internet. Parents think their children will gain sufficient information from school lessons and that they will acquire SRH facts on their own, as they grow older. In terms of ideal age of marriage, all groups agreed that for females it is between 20-25 years old, while for males the ideal age is 25-30 years old. With regard to responding to unplanned pregnancy, all groups believe that marriage is the best solution. While most adolescents would choose to get married, have and raise the child, abortion was proposed as a solution by some of the older adolescents.  Parents in general are not in favor of abortion and would commit to supporting their children morally and financially their child was faced with an unplanned pregnancy. </p><p></p><p>When it comes to access to information on contraception the majority of parents and stakeholders felt that this should not be available to unmarried adolescents, as they believe it will encourage premarital sex and promiscuity.  The main challenges in providing access and information on contraceptive options to unmarried adolescent are: resource limitations, legal barriers, lack of enforcement of supportive policies, cultural values and norms, services that are not youth friendly, and the lack of coordination across stakeholder groups.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The rich data gleaned from this survey advances the current knowledge of adolescent reproductive health in Indonesia beyond standard indicators such as fertility rates and contraceptive prevalence rate. It provides infromation on adolescents and key stakeholder’s knowledge, attitudes, and  perceptions related to SRH, including in sensitive issues such as unplanned pregnancy, abortion, and use of contraception in a Muslim-majority setting.</p><p>The findings of this study contribute to improving the National Adolescent Reproductive Health by providing the evidence of the following opportunities: the need for improved access, the quality of, and approaches to reproductive health education for adolescents; the need for improved cross-cutting cooperation amongst program implementers to increase the effectiveness of funding and program impact; the need to strengthen legal frameworks to protect the ARH program and adolescent’s sexual and reproductive health rights; and the need to implement strategic communication campaigns and develop digital platforms to increase access to ARH information.</p><p>·       </p>",

      "title": "Disability inclusive comprehensive sexuality education for Vietnamese adolescents of Quang Tri Province",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>HI has developed a project on 3 years of inclusive sex education. This project targets young people and adolescents aged 16 to 30, including young people with disabilities, and offer them education, awareness and mobilization sessions. The objective of the project is the improvement of the knowledge and practices of the Vietnamese youth in Quang Tri province to fight against sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies and risky practices, often at the origin of impairments, especially among a population uninformed because of its difficulties in accessing awareness messages.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Several studies conducted by HI have proven, particularly in Vietnam, that people with disabilities, including those with sensory impairments have a level of knowledge impaired compared to people without disabilities. Health knowledge, including sexual and reproductive health, is also affected. In a similar study conducted in Ethiopia[1], it turned out that 78% of young people with disabilities never had the opportunity to discuss sexuality with their parents. On the project, only 7% of participants had these discussions with their parents. This is due to parents' frequent anxiety, lack of training and tools to communicate with their children (Bilge, Çeber &amp;</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The awareness training was conducted through a tri-partite partnership, facilitated by HI, between the Quang Tri Special School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the Quang Tri Provincial Hospital and the Hue Medical University.</p><p>HI provided support to the University for the design of the training materials, the hospital provided the doctor who received training on the methodology and rapid training in sign language provided by Quang Tri School.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>By the end of the project, HI managed to cover 52 young people who attended 6 sessions of comprehensive sexuality education. The average age was 22 years with the youngest attendant being 16 years old and the oldest 30. Most of the participants were attending as a couple. All of them were students at the Quang Tri Special School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and 22% of them were part-time students.</p><p>The results were stunning as 79% of the students improved their knowledge on sexuality and reproductive health. 15% had approximately similar level before and after the sessions while 6% had lower results at the post-test. This meaning that the methodology still needed to be improved.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "The program developed in Vietnam is a good example of the disability inclusion strategy promoted by HI. Developing sexuality education for adolescents with disabilities is only one aspect of a global reflection on the social position of adolescents with disabilities. A better involvement of these young people in society requires equitable and adapted access to prevention information, especially related to sexuality and thus ensures more sexual and reproductive rights.",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The project <strong>Adolescent Reproductive Health Information and Services (ARHIS)</strong> is a nine-month pilot project which intended to bridge the existing and hindering gaps between reproductive health information and services, particularly with regard to family planning and HIV, among adolescent boys and girls aged 10-19 years in the 2nd Congressional District of Quezon City, Philippines. It aimed to increase adolescents' and young people's knowledge and awareness about their sexual and reproductive health (SRH), address various issues and  concerns related to adolescents’ and young people’s SRH, and at the same time make a wide range of reproductive health services accessible and available to them.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>A baseline survey was initially conducted by highly-skilled community mobilizers to gather a situational analysis of adolescents' and young people’s sexual and reproductive health issues and concerns. The results of this survey were then presented in a stakeholders' meeting to gather and foster community support and involvement. Further, interactive learning sessions (ILS) on a variety of sexual and reproductive health topics, among young people, parents, and community leaders also took into consideration the baseline survey results. With regard to reproductive health service provision, both facility-based service delivery and outreach activities, thus bringing in services more accessible and available, were employed.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The project Adolescent Reproductive Health Information and Services (ARHIS) was a nine-month pilot project, implemented from June 2015 to March 2016, in the five (5) urban-poor barangays of the 2nd Congressional District of Quezon City in the Philippines. These barangays include Bagong Silangan, Batasan Hills, Commonwealth, Holy Spirit, and Payatas. Out of the abovementioned barangays, only Bagong Silangan is not included in the list of Top Ten Most Populous Barangays in the National Capital Region based on the 2015 Census of Population.</p><p>It intended to bridge the existing and hindering gaps between reproductive health information and services, particularly with regard to family planning and HIV, among adolescent boys and girls aged 10-19 years. Although originally intended for adolescent boys and girls, the project extended its services to cater young people aged 20-24 who have had a previous pregnancy during their adolescence so as to limit succeeding unwanted and unplanned pregnancies.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In a span of nine months, the project was able to yield the following results:</p><p>• A total of 521 adolescents and youth (AY) reached by interactive learning sessions on various sexual and reproductive health topics, including but not limited to, puberty; sexual orientation, gender identities and expressions (SOGIE); responsible relationships; teenage pregnancies; family planning; and HIV &amp; AIDS.</p><p>• A total of 218 parents and community leaders informed of AY sexual and reproductive health issues and concerns.</p><p>• More than 350 AY provided with family planning services including pills, both combined oral and progestin-only; and progestin-only injectables and implants.</p><p>• More than 380 AY availed of condoms as means of STI and HIV prevention. A noble initiative of the project is the identification of a \"condom distributor\" – a youth leader who has been educated about STI and HIV prevention as well as correct condom use, as the focal point for condom access in the community.</p><p>• A total of 25 young people, parents, and community leaders identified as ARHIS champions who have been instrumental in the achievement of project deliverables through their dedication and commitment to support the project.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The concept of adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) remains to be a huge challenge in the Philippine context. This is due to the fact that majority of Filipinos, due to its conservative and predominantly Catholic culture, are still not keen on discussing issues and concerns related to ASRH, particularly with regard to the alarming increase of teenage pregnancies and the rapid increase of HIV cases among 15-24 year olds.</p><p>However, the project, albeit a pilot, has demonstrated that with the involvement and support of parents and key community stakeholders, these barriers may be addressed. The project has further demonstrated how adolescents and young people yearn for reproductive health information and services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Nepal has accepted health as a fundamental human right in its constitution 2015. The Government has aimed to enable country to increase access to and use of quality Family Planning services by poor and marginalized population by empowering to have the desired family size and have healthy spacing of childbirths. Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016 demonstrated that fertility trend decreased from 4.6 to 2.3 from 1996 to 2016. Adolescent fertility decreased from 127 to 88 during the same period of time. The use of any methods of Family Planning by married women has already doubled from 29% in 1996 to 53% in 2016. Use of modern method increased from 26 to 43 percent during this time but has not changed since last ten years. Use of any modern methods of adolescent is 14.5 percent and young women are 23.9 percent. Unmet need of family planning is 24 % in 2016. It is very high (34.9%) among adolescent and 32.9% among young women. That result indicates that Nepal is slightly behind in meeting the SDG target. To increase family planning service utilization by adolescent and young people UNFPA Nepal implemented FP satellite clinics in the remote parts of the country.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In close collaboration with District Public Health Offices, low Contraceptive Prevalence Rate areas were selected to organize family planning satellite clinics in 2017 and conducted clinics where the regular services of Long Acting Removal Contraceptive (LARC) was not available. The activity was tested in one remote part of the district where 35 LARC service provided mainly young married women from Muslim and marginalized community. More than 50 clients visited the clinic for counseling. It was very success cost effective intervention to reach to the unreached population for family planning. This achievement was shared among different stakeholders and decided to expand. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This program implemented in two districts of Province No 1, four districts of Province No 2 and one district of Province No 3. Out of seven districts, five districts were in the Terai region and two districts were in hilli rigion. Southern parts of four districts are adjoining with Bihar state of India. There are 549 Public Health service delivery centers with. Only 78 health facilities have five Family Planning Services and only 91 health facilities have Implant service only. Satellite clinics were implemented from March 2017 and continued up to the end of the year. Sixty three must vulnerable and having low contraceptive prevalence rate clusters were selected from district stakeholder meeting and scheduled FCHV orientation, Health Mother Group orientation, date of satellite clinics. It was decided to organize the clinic bi-monthly in the same locality/health facility. Married adolescent and young women, Muslim and marginalized were informed and counseled for Long Acting Removal Contraceptive (LARC).  Data was collected from service delivery units and relied on face sheet collected by service providers. One Implant and One IUCD trained health service providers were included in the team of satellite clinics including FP counselor, record keeper and FCHVs. More than 25 clients</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Contraceptive Prevalence Rate of the districts increased and contributed to reduce unwanted pregnancies. Within 10 months period of program implementation in 2017, 3500 new Implant and 742 new IUCD services added in the family planning services. It was almost new family planning service utilization from satellite clinics. Among the total Long Acting Removal Contraceptive (LARC) services, 82.5 percent utilized Implant and 17.5 percent utilized IUCD. Out of total Implant users, 71.43 percent were adolescent and young women. 35.14 percent Dalit, 29.91 percent Muslim, 19.34 percent Janajati and 15.6 Brahamin/Chhetri utilized services among the total Implant users. Out of total IUCD users, 42.86 percent were Muslim, 28.97 percent were Janajati, 15.09 percent were Dalit and 13.07 percent were Brahman and Chhetri. 40.43 percent were adolescent and young women. That indicates the main target group of family planning satellite clinics were well encompassed in the service. Most marginalized and vulnerable women of reproductive age including married adolescent and young women mostly utilized LARC services from satellite clinics. This is an effective approach to reduce unmet need of family planning in remote parts of the country.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Nepal is geographically and economically highly variant country for utilization of health services. All family planning services are not easily accessible to the marginalized people in Nepal. Unavailability of public health services in doorsteps, shortage of trained human resources, inaccessibility of twenty-four hours services, round year unavailability of family planning commodities are main challenges to reduce the unmet need of family planning in Nepal. Visiting services of family planning targeting to the most vulnerable people observed effective. Family planning satellite clinic is one of the important and cost effective approaches to make family planning services accessible to the Muslim and adolescent and young women of reproductive age. The data shows that satellite camp of Long Acting Removal Contraceptive can fulfill the demand of birth spacing in the remote part of the country. Strengthening the regular services including training to the human resource on LARC and establishing new LARC site, satellite clinics should be organized in the different remote part of the country. Pre-satellite clinic campaign should be organized by mobilizing female community health volunteers. It is one of the strategic interventions to raise awareness and create demand of services in the inaccessible geographical terrain. Family planning satellite clinics mobilizing trained health service providers from nearby health facility strengthen stewardship and develop leadership.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Whereas many researches on adolescent sexual behavior have focused on the various negative impacts of early sexual initiation among adolescents, very few have actually studied the psychosocial antecedents of this behavior. Accordingly, traditional health programs that were grounded on the inference of such studies have involved usual interventions like knowledge enhancement, use of contraceptives or promoting abstinence. Although these approaches have been present for a long time, there still seems to be a missing part in the attempt to delay early sexual initiation and to prevent its consequences among adolescents. Factors that serve as early warning signs of adolescent sexual behavior are also needs to be studied. Intention to have sex was found to be significantly associated with sexual intercourse, participation in sexual behaviors and greater overall hetero-social risks such as being involved in a number of progressively riskier situations. It is suggested that program interventions that focus on sexual intentions may yield more desirable outcomes as compared to targeting other elements like self-esteem and emotions.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study examines the sexual intention of adolescents and possible factors that lead to this intention. The study focuses on individual-level variables and interactions and uses the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a guiding model for its conceptual framework. Specifically, the study hypothesizes that (1) perceived parental monitoring, (2) perceived peer norms towards sex (3) attitudes towards sexual intercourse and (4) sexual self-efficacy – resistive (SSE-R) are significantly associated with an adolescent’s intention to have sex in the next 1-2 years.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study design is analytic cross-sectional. The study area is San Pedro City, Laguna Province, Philippines. The city was chosen for its relatively high teen pregnancy cases. The study population are Grade 10 male and female students from three public high schools in the city. Consent was obtained from both students and parents. Data collection took only an average of one hour for each class. A total of 292 students are included in the study. Questionnaire type of data collection method was employed. External assessment and pre-testing of questionnaire was done to ensure clarity and consistency. For the respondent profile, only age and sex were collected. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items on perceived parental monitoring (7 items); perceived peer norms towards sex (3 items); attitudes towards sexual intercourse (3 items); sexual self-efficacy – resistive (SSE-R) (4 items); and sexual intention (3 items). The data was analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 24. Descriptive statistics included proportion of variables; while inferential statistics included correlations and odds ratio. Correlation analysis was computed using Pearson Correlation or Chi-square Test at 0.05 level of significance. After which, binary logistic regression was used to compute for the odds ratio at 0.05 level of significance.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>There respondents of the study were 38.4% males and 61.6% females, with mean age of 16 for both sexes. Results of the survey indicate that among males, 28.6% intends to have sex in next 1-2 years; while among females the proportion is only 2.8%. Most male respondents (69.6%) perceive moderate level of parental monitoring; whereas, most female respondents (57.2%) perceive high level of parental monitoring. Majority of both males (91.1%) and females (94.4%) think that the peers of a female teenager would lose respect for her if she starts having sex. Meanwhile, only a little over half (53.6%) of the males and about two-thirds (65.6%) of females perceive that a male teenager would lose the respect of his peers once he starts having sex. Also, most males (46.4%) and females (52.2%) perceive that some of their peers are already having sex. Nevertheless, almost all females (97.8%) and most of the males (70.5%) reported having negative attitudes towards sexual intercourse. A high SSE-R was reported by almost all female respondents (97.8%) and most male respondents (68.8%). Among males, sexual intention is significantly associated with perceiving most peers are having sex, perceiving no change in friends’ respect towards a male teen who started having sex, having positive attitudes towards sex, and having low sexual self-efficacy resistive. On the other hand, the significant associations found among female respondents are between sexual intention and having positive attitudes towards sex, and having low sexual self-efficacy resistive.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study found that certain psychosocial constructs impact an adolescent’s intention to have sex, which in turn, affects his/her decision to engage in sexual activity. Sexual intention, therefore, is a critical mediating factor because it is able to identify adolescents who are at an increased risk for early sexual initiation. In general, findings indicate that both male and female respondents have relatively optimistic results. The respondents perceived to have experienced moderate to high level of parental monitoring. Moreover, their perceived norms indicate that they do not favor sexual behavior among teenagers. As of the moment, they have negative attitudes towards sex. They also reported having high resistive sexual self-efficacy. Lastly, they reported having no intentions to engage in sex in the next one to two years. These results may be a challenge to relate to the status quo of ASRH in the Philippines, particularly noting the increasing teenage pregnancy rate. Policy makers and program implementers must not be lulled into thinking that the adolescents’ attitudes and perceptions about sex are “protective” against the repercussions of having sex early. The association between some of the psychosocial factors with sexual intention shows that efforts must be made to strengthen these in ASRH programs among teenagers within this age range. Approaches directed on improving self-efficacy, changing attitudes and correcting norms about sex may demonstrate higher effectiveness than increasing knowledge alone which has been the most common strategy in many adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) programs.</p>",

      "title": "Trends and Factors Associated with Child Marriage in Four Asian Countries",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Child marriage is widely recognized as a violation of rights and is also associated with poor reproductive, maternal, child health, and economic outcomes.  Consequently, delaying marriage beyond the adolescent years is often promoted as a means to improve gender equity and to reduce “too early” pregnancy and the associated risks of morbidity.  Amid changing social norms and interventions intended to reduce child marriage, it behooves us to better understand trends in the age distribution of marriage and changing patterns in factors associated with child marriage.</p><p>This study examines changing trends in child marriage and socio-economic factors associated with marriage over the past three decades in four Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Nepal.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "\t<li>To what extent has child marriage decreased since the early 1990s?</li>\t<li>As child marriage declined over time, has the age distribution of marriage changed?</li>\t<li>Which socio-economic factors continue to be associated with child marriage?</li>\t<li>Is child marriage a generalized phenomenon across social groups or has it become increasingly concentrated? If so, among which groups?</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>We use data from 21 DHS surveys in four countries. These surveys are: Bangladesh 1993-94, 1996-97, 1999-2000, 2004, 2007, 2011, 2004; India 1998-99, 2005-06, 2015-16; Indonesia 1991, 1994, 1997, 2002-03, 2007, 2012; and Nepal 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016.  This study consists of two related analyses. In the first, we use survival analysis methods to estimate the cumulative incidence function of age of marriage among women during age 15-24.  These survival curves illustrate shifts in the age structure of child and early marriage.  Tarone-Ware tests of equality are used to detect statistically significant changes between surveys.</p><p>The second analysis examines socio-demographic factors associated with marriage by age 15 and by age 18.  We analyze whether the phenomenon of child marriage is equitably distributed across these factors or has become more concentrated over time, and identify whether the factors associated with child marriage have shifted over time.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We identify a consistent trend toward less child marriage over time.  However, these shifts have not been evenly paced.  Rather, fast and significant change between two successive surveys is followed by a period of slow inter-survey change, followed again by a hastening of change.</p><p></p><p>In three of the four study countries, the shifts in the age distribution of child marriage first manifest in fewer marriages at the youngest ages, followed by less marriage throughout the entire adolescent years. In India, however, a significant reduction in marriage at the youngest ages is most visible in the last 10 years. The shape of the age curve also shifts over time.  The age curve of marriage retains an approximate logistic-type shaped curve (slow pace of marriages at the tails of the age span and rapid increase in the pace of marriage in the middle of the curve).  However, age curves transform over time from being convex during adolescent years to concave, at least during early adolescent years. This indicates that the steepest rise in the pace of marriage has shifted over time from the middle of adolescence to the 20’s or late adolescence.</p><p></p><p>Child marriage is universally associated with education, household wealth, and residence.  Reductions in child marriage occurred most readily among groups where marriage age was already higher: those with more education, richer household wealth quintiles, and urban residents.  Disparities have widened over time, with child marriage increasingly becoming a phenomenon concentrated among the less educated, poorer, and rural women.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study provides evidence of changing patterns in the age distribution of marriage.  It indicates a typical pattern in the pace of change, first occurring among the youngest adolescents and then spreading across the entire adolescent age span.  It also suggests an increasing clustering of child marriage among already disadvantaged groups.  Such information about changing marriage patterns is useful for targeting policies and programs to further reduce child marriage in areas where they are most likely to be effective.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is very low - only 10.3%  of women use a modern method. Adolescent girls are even less likely to use contraception, with only 5% of girls aged 15 to 19 using a modern method.  Unintended pregnancies are associated with an increased likelihood of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. In conflicted-affected regions, the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality is heightened due to a lack of security and fractured health infrastructure.</p><p>Since 2012, Save the Children (STC) has worked to expand access to and demand for family planning (FP) and post-abortion care (PAC) services in North Kivu, a province plagued by ongoing conflict since 2004.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>STC’s twofold approach in the DRC has focused on service provision and community mobilization, including a tailored demand generation activities and advocacy strategy. As uptake of services has increased over time, the community mobilization efforts must remain robust and nimble to ensure that all community FP and PAC needs are met.</p><p>This shows that <strong>systematic evaluation of community mobilization strategies</strong> leads to more refined and targeted means of reaching even the most marginalized members of the community with FP and PAC information and messaging.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The DRC team established a semi-annual systematic evaluation of their community mobilization strategy. As a part of this evaluation, client exit interviews, registers, and project data are reviewed, with particular focus on the source of health facility referrals, number of community sessions conducted and their topics, and linkages with other health services that can effectively increase knowledge and uptake of reproductive health services. Focus groups are conducted with clients and community members to have feedback on what strategies are effective and which are not. Finally, reasons for removal of LARC methods of FP are examined and program staff and health providers seek ways of addressing these issues through community health workers, information sessions, and targeted outreach.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Uptake of FP and PAC services has continually increased in North Kivu. This is due to project quality, but without strong community mobilization, this increase would be less notable. For example, it was noted via routine program data that opposition in the household was a major reason for the increased removal of implants and IUDs. Through the evaluation community mobilization activities, staff learned that despite some effort, the male population was not being reached adequately. STC staff realized that community messaging was geared toward women. Further, the points of care where FP services were well-integrated, tended to be frequented primarily by women- ANC, PNC, and post-school consultations.  Now, FP is integrated into male health services and FP messaging is tailored specifically to men and the program is now seeing more positive feedback from previously skeptical men and their female partners. Similarly, the public generated feedback that adolescents not attending school were not reached with the community mobilization strategy, particularly in camp settings, so the staff has focused attention on peer education in camps and areas where adolescents gather, training adolescents not in a school environment to be peer educators and deliver critical FP messages.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Community mobilization should be dynamic and ever adjusting. Communities vary, as do the messages that resonate with them and as communities adapt, updated health messages are necessary. Initially in North Kivu, community messages were solely focused on availability of FP and PAC services. Now, as demand continues to grow, it is critical to continually looking for new BCC strategies to address topics and subpopulations that can be more difficult to influence.</p>",

Worldwide, Eastern Africa has the highest rate of unsafe abortion among sub-regions. In this region about 18 percent of maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortion. In Kenya, maternal mortality caused by unsafe abortion is projected to exceed the sub-regional estimates. About 464,000 induced abortions occur annually in Kenya, with an abortion rate of 48 per 1,000 women of reproductive age (15-49).</p><p>To prevent future unintended pregnancy and repeat abortions contraceptive counselling and provision of contraceptive methods is an essential element in post abortion care (PAC). Furthermore, the inspiration to introduce an effective contraceptive method is highest instantly after the abortion. However, women seeking PAC are reluctant to admit to an induced abortion. Subsequently PAC providers have difficulties to recognise women’s pregnancy intentions. There are no published data on studies in low-income countries which have investigated women’s pregnancy intention and acceptance of a contraceptive method within PAC. The aim of this study was to investigate contraceptive uptake among PAC seeking women reporting the pregnancy as unplanned versus planned in western Kenya.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Lesser awareness about conceptions mechanism and fewer knowledge of efficient use of reversible method of contraceptive attributes to higher casual sexual encounter leading to unwanted pregnancies. Among married and unmarried couple risk involved with the practicing of the traditional method is also one bigger threat causing failure. In developing countries like India, the major problem examined related to contraceptive practicing is basically underlined into two types, first being the unmet need for contraception and second is related to the failure of contraceptive. Both are critical to rising in the contraceptive prevalence in any country but later is more decisive to the decline in CPR given the unmet need is met. This failure leads to unwanted pregnancies, which in majority of the cases end up in induced abortions. Couple’s aspiration of using contraception and consequent failures leading to abortion despite effort discourage the motivations of using it but bears very scanty literature in India at the sub national level. So, the need of the hour is to quantify and establish the relations between the induced abortions taking place due to unintended pregnancies and contraceptive failure in India in the light of several socioeconomic and demographic determinants at the sub national level. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>There are three main hypothesis of the study</p>\t<li>The effectiveness of family planning methods is significantly different.</li>\t<li>There exist wide variations in the failure rate of method mix according to the type of users.</li>\t<li>An induced abortion due to the failure of method significantly varies among the users of method mix.</li><p></p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study takes the underutilized section of calendar data from Measurement Learning and Evaluation (MLE) survey that maintains calendar columns (2009-2014) for different method mix and following reasons of discontinuations both for urban poor and non-poor in six bigger districts of Uttar Pradesh. The survey was motivated to understand and differentiate the assessment of family planning services among urban poor in the concerned state. A hybrid mechanism of study constituting the combination of both longitudinal and cross section has been implemented in the MLE survey, where the intervention regarding the family planning was introduced by URHI. Out of 14,043 women aged 15-49 years successfully interviewed in the end line of the survey, 7496 episodes of all reversible methods included in the final study. This study basically focused on two outcomes 1) Contraceptive failure &amp; 2) Induced abortion followed by failure episodes. An associated decrement life table is used for calculating failure rate for different methods and for different population. In order to examine the effects of background characteristics of respondent on failure rate of different contraceptive methods a Weibull accelerated failure time model is performed. Further for understanding the role of method mix on induced abortion logistic regression is used.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Among the total acceptors, those users who relied on the long term spacing mechanism like IUD/PPIUD experienced lesser failure rates than the user who adopted coital dependent methods like pills and condom etc. Traditional method users have experienced higher failure than that of the modern methods. Condom and traditional method were the most used method in the last five year of observation period, because of this separate analysis were conducted for these methods. Looking at the statistics in the analysis of the study, one can infer that there are several characteristics of the respondent which influence mix method failure rate: age of the user, socioeconomic status (Caste, Wealth Index, and Religion), educational status, region of residence and fertility related variable such as number of living children and desire level of children. The episodes offered by private medical sectors have lower failure rate than public medical sector. The hazard ratio of one-year failure rate indicates that episodes of accidental pregnancy are higher among the users who migrated in the surveyed city from any other city of UP and lower for the users who previously belong to any other state of India. This finding reveals that respondent’s previous residence influences their present use of contraception. Moving towards the reproductive consequences of these failures, we get that around 29 percent of all spacing method failure episodes terminated with abortion which is around 28 percent of all abortions reported by the users in the study period.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Due to lack of comprehensive estimation mechanism and due to larger abortions taking place outside the facility settings, abortion statistics are often underestimated. This study attempts to provide an estimate of induced abortions which occur due to the failure of a method in Uttar Pradesh, which stands out as the most populous state in India and positioned fifth in the world order in terms of population size. The study suggests multitude of factors that contributes significantly to the rising of contraceptive failure as well as abortions, such as parity of women, her caste ethnicity &amp; her economical condition but a most influential factor is the place from where she gets the method and the finding suggests that a skilled and professional provider of public medical services is needed so that they offer the effective methods with the proper knowledge regarding the use of the specific method. The place from where the respondent belongs or the place of origin also plays a significant role in analyzing the failure rate, though they currently live in the study areas their choice and pattern of use are identical with the place they belonged previously. So it is necessary to target these users with the schemes &amp; plans different from the users of a study area. All failure episodes not ended in induced abortion most of them resultant in a live birth which adversely affects the fertility rate of the population.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning is a critical and often-overlooked topic in the postpartum period, when women and providers tend to shift focus to the health of babies. In Kenya, nearly 50% of births occur within 24 months of another birth, representing an unmet need for promotion of healthy birth spacing and postpartum family planning (PPFP). Many women in Kenya do not receive PPFP information from their providers after delivery and do not know when their fertility will return after birth. These facts, coupled with a high rate of mobile phone penetration in Kenya (&gt;80%), present an opportunity to share health information and reminders about PPFP through short message service (SMS). Jacaranda Health worked with the target community of postpartum women and healthcare providers to develop light-weight, low-cost PPFP information/reminders for women delivering at public hospitals in Kiambu County, Kenya. The messages were designed in informal Swahili, piloted with new mothers, and enabled with two-way capability. In order to evaluate the impact of the messages, a randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted between November 2017 – April 2018 with 897 women. Jacaranda Health has now begun an expansion throughout Kiambu County. Women can self-enroll into the messaging program via a mobile short code.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We aimed to test whether a package of information delivered in via SMS to women after childbirth could impact the rate of uptake of PPFP when compared with a control group who received the standard of care.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted an RCT at three large public hospitals in Kiambu County, Kenya, outside of Nairobi. Each facility had 100+ deliveries per month. Women aged 18-40, who had given birth vaginally without complications, and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to enroll in the study when they were discharged. Women were randomized into one of four study arms after enrollment. The first arm, the control group, did not receive any mobile messages. The second arm received information on postpartum danger signs via SMS (19 messages total). The third arm received the danger sign messages and general postpartum care messages (31 messages total). The fourth arm received the danger sign messages and postpartum family planning messages starting 30 days after discharge (26 messages total).</p><p>Example family planning message: <em>It’s possible to get pregnant soon after delivery, even before seeing your periods. Visit a hospital to make a plan to start family planning.</em></p><p>Participants completed a baseline survey in person (November 2017-March 2018) when they enrolled and an endline survey via phone at 8 weeks postpartum (January 2018-May 2018).  Analysis was conducted in STATA and used to calculate the likelihood of PPFP uptake for each study group. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Result data was analyzed for participants completing baseline surveys (n=897) and endline surveys (n=511). At baseline, 47.8% of participants (n=427) reported wanting another child in the future, with a median time of the desired next child being in 5 years. 36.1% of participants reported not wanting more children (n= 323) and 16.11% (n=144) were unsure of their intentions for future children. The odds of women in the FP messaging arm taking up PPFP by 8 weeks postpartum was 1.6 times the odds of women in the other groups and was statistically significant (p=0.02). The intervention arms which did not receive the PPFP package did not show any increased odds of uptake. In the family planning message arm, 57% of women had taken up PPFP by 8 weeks postpartum, compared with 45% of women in the other arms. Women in all messaging arms reported high rates of reading the messages (98%), and high rates of understanding the messages (99%). Across all arms, 68% of women who had not started PPFP said they intended to take up a method in the future, 17% said they did not intend to take up a method, and 14% were unsure, with no significant differences between arms.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results of this study show tremendous promise that lightweight mobile tools can be effective in low-income country contexts to promote postpartum family planning and healthy birth spacing. While most women in our study expressed a desire to delay pregnancy after their recent birth, the rates of postpartum family planning uptake at 8 weeks were below 50% for all groups except the women who received simple SMS reminders and information. This exposes a possible gap in the healthcare system in the period after birth, when women may not be provided with the family planning reminders and information they need to make informed choices to match their fertility intentions. Health providers should utilize the opportunity of women being present at health facilities for birth and newborn care/vaccinations to share postpartum family planning information. While our study shows that SMS reminders are an effective tool for sharing this information, it is critical that messages be designed with the end-users themselves so that the information is understandable and relevant, and that the facilities initiating similar programs are prepared to provide comprehensive PPFP services. For Jacaranda’s county expansion project in 2018, we are sharing the PPFP messages with all women who self-enroll. We hope to reach 10,000 women within 12 months through facility-based posters and other awareness activities, getting information to women when they need it most.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In India, nearly half of the 48 million pregnancies taking place among women in ages 15-49 annually is estimated to be unintended, highlighting huge unmet need for contraceptive services. Among women and girls with an unmet need for family planning are those who have recently given birth or undergone an abortion. Although contraception following an induced abortion is highly recommended for preventing another unintended pregnancy and repeat abortion, little is known about the number of women who adopt contraception following an induced abortion or factors that facilitate or hinder such women from doing so in India. The few studies that have examined post-abortion contraceptive practices have described the experiences of women of reproductive ages; studies focusing on young women – a group known to be more disadvantaged than adult women in terms of social, economic and human assets, access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and SRH outcomes – are almost non-existent.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Drawing on data from a community-based study conducted among married young women in ages 15-24 in two large states of India – Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh – in 2015, this paper examines contraceptive intentions and practices among young women who had experienced an induced abortion in the two years preceding the interview. Specifically, we present findings on the extent to which young women who had an abortion had intended to practise contraception following their abortion and had adopted contraception immediately after abortion, that is, within two months of abortion. We also present findings on factors correlated with post-abortion contraceptive use.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this paper were drawn from the baseline survey of an evaluation of a district-level model that sought to provide a continuum of care to married young women by strengthening the capacity of health care providers in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The survey was conducted during February-July 2015 in 100 primary sampling units (PSUs) across four districts, selected using multi-stage systematic random sampling technique, among married young women in ages 15-24 who were married, had become pregnant or had delivered a child in the two years prior to the survey. A total of 4,952 married young women were successfully interviewed, with a response rate of 96%. We used data from the contraceptive calendar to identify women who had experienced an induced abortion in the two years prior to the interview and some 3% of women reported an induced abortion (N=166), and of these, data on post-abortion contraceptive practices were available for 150 young women and findings presented in this paper focus on these women. Descriptive statistics were used to describe contraceptive intentions and use. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the correlates of post-abortion contraceptive use.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Findings show that the majority of young women who had an abortion had intended to practise contraception post-abortion: overall, 65% intended to use contraception at some time following their abortion and 59% reported intentions to use within two months of abortion. The majority of young women who had intended to use contraception within two months of abortion had wanted to use condoms (30 out of 57 young women), followed by female sterilization (9 out of 57). Young women who were advised around the time of abortion about post-abortion contraceptive use and who had practised contraception prior to the index abortion were more likely than others to report intentions to practise contraception within two months of abortion. In contrast, young women who had delayed seeking abortion were less likely than others to express such intentions.</p><p>Just 28% had adopted contraception within two months of abortion. The majority had adopted condoms (18 out of 39), followed by oral pills (7 out of 39). Young women who had delayed seeking abortion were less likely than others to have adopted contraception (OR 0.47). On other hand, young women with two or more surviving sons were more likely than others to have adopted contraception (OR 2.49). Young women’s age at abortion or educational attainment were not associated with post-abortion contraceptive use. Factors such as receipt of contraceptive counselling around the time of abortion, prior use of contraception before the index abortion and the type of abortion method were also not correlated.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our paper extends the limited literature on post-abortion contraceptive intentions and use among married young women, a population sub-group that is widely acknowledged to be at a considerable social and health disadvantage in India. Unlike most previous studies, which were based on clinic-based samples, our study has drawn on a community-based sample of married young women. Findings confirm that post-abortion contraceptive uptake is limited, although many more had intended to use contraception. Our findings call for improved attention to providing contraceptive counselling and services to married young women who seek abortion.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Providing family planning services following a birth or pregnancy termination is a critical component of reproductive health to address unmet need for birth spacing or limiting family size.  Short inter-pregnancy intervals are a well-established risk factor for poor infant, child and maternal health and survival. Contraception following livebirth or abortion prevents unwanted pregnancy and thus the risk of induced abortion or miscarriage or an unwanted child. Postpartum contraception is therefore of high public health importance. Up to two-thirds of women in low income countries would like to avoid pregnancy in the first year after delivery but are not using contraception. Winfrey and Rakesh (2014) have examined the use of family planning by type of method in the postpartum period in 43 developing countries disaggregated by women’s demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and fertility preference. A major gap in knowledge concerns demand for, and means of promoting, immediate postpartum family planning services in Asia and Africa as identified by Cleland et al..  Shah and colleagues discussed the validity and measurement of the concept of unmet need for family planning during the postpartum period, and presented key findings on postpartum contraceptive protection, use dynamics, and method mix.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main objective of this paper is to identify gaps in post-partum protection (both, natural and contraceptive) in the 12 months following delivery and compare the country specific results with the recent WHO recommendations published in <em>Programming Strategies for Postpartum Family Planning </em>(7). More specifically, the paper aims to answer the following research questions:</p>\t<li>What first contraceptive method is used following birth?</li>\t<li>Is timing of post-partum uptake of a method related to contraceptive discontinuation?</li>\t<li>What is the typical length of exposure to risk of conception in the 12 month following childbirth and how does this vary across countries</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>The data came from the Demographic and Health Surveys, with reproductive calendar. The dates of starting and ending contraceptive episodes of use and the main reason for stopping use are ascertained. Durations of postpartum amenorrhea, sexual abstinence and breastfeeding following live-births collected in the maternity history section, were mapped into the calendar as months of postpartum insusceptibility and breastfeeding.  In the paper, insusceptibility is defined by length of post-partum amenorrhea (or by length of post-partum abstinence if that is longer.</p><p>Reasons for discontinuation were categories into: all causes; failure, method-related reasons ( comprising all reasons that imply some form of dissatisfaction with the method or associated services) and no further need.  A binary variable was constructed to indicate whether a delay in contraceptive uptake occurred in the 12 months post-partum or not. Delayed uptake was defined as contraception uptake at least one month after resumption of susceptibility or became susceptible and did not use any method.</p><p>Both single and multiple decrement life-tables were used in the analysis of time to discontinuation and cause-specific reasons and time to first post-partum event.  Adjustments for survey standardized sample weights and clustering were taken were applied in all analysis using Stata version 15.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, 101,964 pregnancies in 17 countries during the three years prior to the survey were covered by the analysis.  A majority (72%) of all pregnancies ended in live birth, while 12% were terminated or miscarried and 14% were still continuing.  The median succeeding pregnancy interval between the end of last pregnancies and next conception was within the narrow range of 21-28 months. The type of first method used postpartum is very diverse. In the four countries of sub-Saharan Africa and in Colombia and Peru, injectables In Bangladesh, Philippines, Dominican Republic and Morocco, oral contraceptives. Condoms predominate in Maldives and Ukraine, withdrawal in Azerbaijan, Moldova and Turkey and IUDs in Vietnam and Egypt.  Postpartum sterilization is uncommon with the exceptions of Colombia and Dominican Republic where this method accounts for at least one in five of all first contraceptive episodes.  LAM) is rare except in Moldova and Morocco. Contraceptive adoption by month 12 was 63.5%, 8% of women had used no method and conceived while the remainder had also used no method but had not conceived.  Country variations in postpartum uptake or conception are striking. In sub-Saharan Africa and Maldives, contraceptive adoption is low at 34%  and highest, 70%, in Colombia, Moldova, Morocco and Turkey. With regard to the probability of conception, country estimates range from 5-22%. The highest probability of conception is found in Azerbaijan, where contraceptive adoption is rather low. The next highest conception incidence is observed in Philippines, also a country with a modest level of contraceptive adoption. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Despite concerted efforts to promote postpartum family planning, the uptake of any method and especially of a modern method remains low in the 17 countries studied. We find a wide variety of patterns in terms of the timing of uptake, the type of the first contraceptive method used and the risk of conceiving within 12 months following a birth or pregnancy termination. The average length of breastfeeding, amenorrhea, sexual abstinence and insusceptibility.</p><p>Of major health consequence is the conception rate that range from 5% to as high as 22% by 12th month since last birth or pregnancy termination. Conception rates are higher in countries with low postpartum contraceptive uptake or heavy reliance on traditional methods. Our findings suggest the need to increase postpartum contraceptive use and especially long-acting reversible methods.</p><p>This work will be expanded to include all avilable DHS surveys with reprodcutive calendar to assess with country's trends  </p><p></p>",

      "title": "Postpartum family planning:  amenorrhea, breastfeeding and the timing of family planning uptake in Rwanda. Second analysis of Demographic Health Survey 2014",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Postpartum family planning has been identified as an appropriate approach for improving use of family planning, especially to address women who would like to limit or space subsequent births.  At the last Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in 2014, postpartum family planning (PPFP) use in Rwanda was low relative to overall use of family planning among all women. .  PPFP was identified a strategy for high impact, in particular shortening period between birth and initiation of FP use. However, information is lacking regarding the use of FP in postpartum period, as the DHS final report does not provide specific data on PPFP. This study aims to provide more information regarding the characteristics of women using PPFP and timing within the postpartum period for better implementation of PPFP as a new in the strategy for family planning and Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (FP/ASRH).</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What is the mCPR at various times in the postpartum period?</p><p>What groups of women are most likely to use postpartum FP?</p><p>How do beliefs about fecundity and return to fecundity correlate with the timing of the adoption of PPFP?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Demographic and Health Survey series includes month by month information on contraceptive use for each women interviewed for the five years preceding the survey.  This “calendar” allows identification of family use patterns following births for relatively large numbers of women relative to the numbers of women who are postpartum at the time of the survey. </p><p>We linked the use of family planning with women’s socio-demographic and economic characteristics and the initiation of postpartum family planning use to breastfeeding patterns, return of menses, understanding of the reproductive cycle and time to next pregnancy.  Also other background variables were examined relative to inception of postpartum family planning use.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The secondary analysis found that only 7% of women are using any FP one month postpartum, and growth is slow in the succeeding months. Furthermore, there are some large difference in the use of postpartum family planning across various social, demographic and economic factors, but these did not yield statistically significant relationships in a logistic regression model. Well educated women, younger women (15-24 years), women with complete antenatal care were much more likely to use postpartum FP. Women with more 5 or more children and women with longer previous birth interval are less likely to use PPFP. There were not any large differences seen between urban and rural for postpartum FP use. Disaggregating modern method use reveals a steady increase in the use of injectables and implants throughout the postpartum period, while pill and condom use are low and level off at approximately four months postpartum. Women who are not breastfeeding and women who are not amenorrhoeic are significantly more likely to use modern family planning than women who are breastfeeding and amenorrhoeic respectively.  This is true for all postpartum periods (0-2 months, 3-5 months, etc.).  For example, 57% of non-amenorrhoeic women are using family planning at 0-2 months versus only 12% of amenorrhoeic women.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Increasing uptake of family planning in the postpartum period is complicated.  It requires the right combination of antenatal care, delivery services and follow up via integrated services to follow through after a woman has given birth.  Understanding the decision-making process and correlates surrounding family planning will improve the design of postpartum family planning programs.  This methodology can be applied in any country where postpartum family planning will be an important part of a new family planning strategy.  Use of the major points of the analysis will support an improved decision-making process as it did in developing the new national FP/ASRH strategy in Rwanda We hope that a similar set of analyses could be adopted in other country strategies as part of the move toward better evidence based planning.</p>",

      "title": "Use of best friend report to determine prevalence of induced abortion among Kenyan women",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>There are an estimated 80 million unintended pregnancies globally each year, approximately half of which result in induced abortion. Accurate data on prevalence of abortion and risk factors for induced abortion in the general population can be difficult to obtain and data among HIV-infected women is even more limited. Under-reporting of induced abortion is common in places even where it is legal due to stigma surrounding sexual behaviors and abortion. Where abortion is illegal and most unsafe, data is even more limited and not systemically collected. The best friend report may be an effective method to obtain more accurate estimates of sensitive and stigmatized behaviors, including abortion. This technique was first used to assess sexual behaviors and prevalence of abortion in Malawian women. The best friend report asks participants to answer questions based on their friend's behaviors and takes advantage of friends tending to have similar behaviors and sociodemographic characteristics. It may offer a way to overcome biases that are common with sensitive topics. While the best friend report has not previously been evaluated in the context of HIV-infected Kenyan women, it could be an important method to better understand the prevalence of induced abortion in this population.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study’s goal is to measure prevalence of self-reported induced abortion compared to best friend report of induced abortion in HIV-infected Kenyan women. We hypothesize that self-reported induced abortion will be lower than best friend report. Secondary questions include: 1) cofactors associated with induced abortion, and 2) comparison of age and education between participants and their reported best friend. We hypothesize that women with history of induced abortion will be younger, unmarried and report no use of family planning method in the past month and that respondents will have similar demographics as their best friend.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This is a secondary data analysis using data collected from a large cross-sectional survey entitled “<em>Prevalence and Cofactors of Family Planning Uptake and Integration in HIV Care and Treatment Programs in Kenya</em>”. The primary survey enrolled HIV-infected women of reproductive age presenting to 109 HIV Care and Treatment Programs in Kenya. Eligible facilities provided antiretroviral therapy to ≥1000 HIV-infected clients annually. Eligibility criteria for this study included: female gender, ≥1 prior pregnancy, HIV-infected and receiving care at one of the selected HIV Care and Treatment Programs, between 15-49 years of age, vaginal heterosexual intercourse in the past 6 months and ability to provide written consent. The survey included questions about personal history of pregnancies and induced abortion. Participants were also asked to consider their closest friend and answer questions about their best friend’s age, education and prior history of induced abortions. Analyses were restricted to women who answered the survey question about self-reported induced abortion and three questions related to their best friend. Analyses were adjusted to account for facility-level clustering. The prevalence of elective abortion among study participants and their closest female friend was compared using a prevalence odds ratio (POR).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Study staff administered individual level surveys to 4,805 HIV-infected women between the ages of 15-49. Overall, 3,430 women were included in this analysis. A total of 143 women (4.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.3-5.3%) self-reported a history of one or more induced abortions and 13.8%, (95% CI 12.2-15.7%) reported their best friend had a prior induced abortion (POR 4.09; 95% CI 2.70-6.20, p2 prior pregnancies, have fewer living children, and have a history of intimate partner violence compared to women who did not self-report a history of induced abortion. Age, education, income, employment, years since HIV diagnosis, and depression were not significantly different between women.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>We found the prevalence of induced abortion as reported by best friend report was substantially higher than self-report. The prevalence of self-reported induced abortion in our study (4.2%), was consistent with the prevalence previously reported (3.9%) in a 2012 study in Kenya on “procured abortion”. To our knowledge this is the first study to use best friend report to estimate prevalence of induced abortion in Kenyan women. Measurement of induced abortion rates among African women are challenging due to stigma and legal restrictions surrounding abortion. The best friend report method of measuring induced abortion may remove some of the stigma that leads to underreporting and underestimation of true abortion rates. In addition, it can be an easy and cost-effective method to better estimate sensitive and underreported behaviors. While participants and best friends comparisons were limited in this study, we believe the best friend report may help derive better estimates of the true prevalence of induced abortion by allowing participants to answer sensitive questions in an indirect fashion. Further research and validation of this method is needed to determine the utility of this approach. With better understanding of prevalence and cofactors associated with induced abortion in HIV-infected Kenyan women, we can implement and target programs to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>WHO released their guidelines on health worker roles in providing safe abortion care and post abortion contraception in 2015. While safe &amp; simple evidence-based interventions for provision of safe abortion care exist, globally nearly 17 million abortions are less safe, i.e. may be done by trained providers using non-recommended methods or using a safe method (e.g., misoprostol) without adequate information or support from a trained individual &amp; 8 million are least safe done by untrained people using dangerous, invasive methods (Lancet, 2017). These contribute to global burden of maternal mortality and morbidity. In many countries including India, abortion care is limited to doctors only while evidence based interventions for safe abortion and post abortion care, especially in early pregnancy, highlight that the same can be provided on an outpatient basis at primary care level by properly trained health-care providers, including non-physician providers who are trained in basic clinical procedures related to reproductive health.    Ipas Development Foundation worked closely with HRP, WHO and experts in India to review the legal and policy framework for abortion provision by cadres of healthcare providers in India and map it to recommendations in the WHO guidelines. This was used to arrive at policy recommendations</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>It is estimated that 15.6 Million abortions take place in India annually. To provide high quality abortion services to this large cohort of girls and women, there is an acute need to expand the provider base. It is estimated that there are 30,000 obstetricians and close to 900,000 general practitioners in India. Of this only a very small percentage are permitted to offer safe abortion services since GPs require additional training to offer CAC services. The gap between trained provider to women seeking termination of pregnancy is very huge and immediate action needs to be taken to bridge the same.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>India has historically implemented task-shifting and task-sharing for RCH interventions. The WHO guidelines provides global evidence for considering the same for safe abortion care and post-abortion contraception that has to potential to inform policy change for improving access to safe abortion care in India. IDF undertook an exhaustive review of relevant legal and policy guidelines on CAC and post abortion care in India and mapped the permissions to various health worker cadres to the WHO recommendations. This synthesized document was shared with a select group of experts in India who met over two meetings to review the mapping and recommendations for India in light of the on ground services and status of the healthcare system to arrive at the key findings.</p><p>The legal and policy recommendations have been finalized in close consultation with the experts in the form of a policy brief that will be available for dissemination at the conference. It is expected that this policy brief will be used widely by advocates for CAC in India for strengthening services as well as by advocates in other countries to arrive at legal policy recommendations for strengthening CAC services.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Result of the consultative approach was drafting of a comprehensive policy brief that elucidates legal and policy recommendations for improving access to CAC in India with focus on expanding provider base.</p><p>Key recommendations:</p>\t<li>Expanding access to first trimester abortions by amending the abortion law in India and permitting indigenous system of medicine (ISM) practitioners, nurses and ANMs after training to perform first trimester abortions using MMA.  </li>\t<li>Reducing the training requirement for general practitioners (MBBS doctors) to enable a larger cohort of doctors offering CAC services.</li>\t<li>Removing operational barriers of permission for primary health care facilities to offer CAC services only up to 8 weeks and permitting them to provide full first trimester services i.e. up to 12 weeks.</li>\t<li>Permissions for training ISM practitioners, nurses and ANMs to manage incomplete abortions since this is a medical emergency.</li>\t<li>Revision of Indian technical and policy guidelines to explicitly allow ISM practitioners, nurses and ANMs to provide post-abortion care services. Current Indian guidelines are silent about their roles even when these cadres are already trained in management of similar obstetric complications.</li>\t<li>Strengthening women’s access to MMA by:\t\t\t<li>Amending the MTP Rules to remove any reference to gestation age</li>\t\t<li>Permission for use of MMA in India in second trimester too. Currently, MMA is approved for use only up to 9 weeks of gestation</li>\t\t<li>Leverage the role of pharmacists and pharmacy workers for effective dissemination of information on use of MMA</li>\t\t<li>Include ISM practitioners, nurses and ANMs for counselling on CAC services. </li>\t\t</li>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>The WHO Guidelines issued in 2015 provide a range of options for health care providers to safely and effectively perform a particular task/ sub-task in safe abortion care and post abortion contraception. It is for a country to decide on strategies to adopt and use the guidelines based on their local context and health systems. These recommendations have been drafted after significant consultation among experts and it is expected that advocacy by diverse stakeholders shall pave the way for positive change for strengthening women’s access to CAC services in India. </p><p>Expansion of provider base for safe abortion care and post abortion contraception shall bridge the significant gap between trained provider and women seeking care and thereby strengthen quality of CAC services in India. It will also facilitate faster decline in maternal mortality and morbidity as a result of unsafe abortion in India.  </p><p>The extensive process of consultation across relevant stakeholders in country is an example of arriving at strategic recommendations for policy change. This may serve as an example in drafting policy recommendation for health systems in other countries as well. </p>",

In 2015, the IRC embarked on an ambitious strategy, IRC2020, to enhance the quality and reach of our programs to help our beneficiaries achieve key outcomes. A central pillar of IRC2020 is achieving gender equality, which requires improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes for women and girls.</p><p>Despite the IRC’s commitment to women and girls, safe abortion care (SAC) services were still not offered by IRC country program. While there is limited data on unsafe abortion in humanitarian settings, global evidence indicates that the burden of unsafe abortion falls most heavily on poor women and girls in low resources countries, many of which are affected by conflict and natural disaster. This led the IRC to develop a strategy to fulfill our commitment to women and girls and integrate SAC into our programs.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The IRC identified four objectives to integrate SAC into our programs:</p><ul>\t<li>Clarify our organizational commitment to increasing access to SAC;</li>\t<li>Transform staff attitudes toward SAC and the women and girls who request the service;</li>\t<li>Build context-specific knowledge around abortion in each country program; and</li>\t<li>Implement country program-driven approaches to increase access to SAC.</li></ul><p>To realize this strategy, the IRC developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to achieve each objective and established a partnership with Ipas to build our expertise on SAC programming.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2017, the IRC developed, endorsed and disseminated an internal position statement in support of access to SAC for all women and girls. Next, the IRC held a training of trainers on Ipas’ Abortion Values Clarification and Attitude Transformation (VCAT) curriculum in Nairobi for 22 IRC staff from six country programs and headquarters and conducted VCAT workshops in nine countries. The IRC measured staff attitudes toward abortion before and after each workshop using a confidential, quantitative questionnaire. To build context specific knowledge around abortion, the IRC conducted systematic desk reviews and key informant interviews to answer country-specific questions about abortion for six country programs. The IRC also sought opportunities to share our organizational commitment and readiness to implement SAC programming with European donors interested and engaged on SAC advocacy.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>IRC staff who participated in VCAT workshops generally reported improved attitudes toward abortion, though the results were mixed and varied by country. Among IRC VCAT participants in Thailand, the proportion of participants who strongly agreed that all women should have access to abortion in the first trimester increased from 43% to 93% following the workshop. However, in Myanmar, the proportion of participants reporting that they would support their organization providing SAC to any woman who requests it only increased from 0% to 13%.</p><p>In 2017 and 2018, the IRC began safe abortion care programs in Pakistan, Ethiopia and Serbia and provided safe abortion care to 248 women and girls from January 2017-January 2018. Each of these “early adopter” countries developed a unique strategy for service provision. Pakistan offers discrete SAC on request via public and private facilities, Ethiopia supports the Ethiopian government to increase access to safe abortion care to the extent of the law in refugee camps and IRC Serbia facilitates SAC referrals to private providers for migrants and refugees. Two additional country programs are in the process of developing strategies to integrate safe abortion care into their programs and three country programs have received SRH funding that includes safe abortion care.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>The IRC’s experience offers a road map and lessons learned for other organizations hoping to increase access to SAC. Disseminating the internal SAC position statement and conducting VCAT workshops were necessary first steps in generating support and improving understanding around SAC. IRC staff required organizational backing and safe spaces to discuss the complexities of abortion to consider implementing SAC programs. Each IRC country has unique legal considerations and health system dynamics that influence abortion access, therefore a one-size-fits-all approach to programming would not be successful. IRC staff members’ biggest concern was restrictive abortion laws. To identify effective strategies while mitigating risk, each country program needed to explore not only the letter of the law but also its interpretation and application as well as how it interacts with international law. “Early adopter” countries succeeded by designing unique, context-specific SAC program strategies. For IRC country programs where SAC has not yet been integrated, staff buy-in was often contingent on additional funding for SAC due the limits of their current grant portfolio. Donors who aim to fund SAC in crises should discuss SAC with their grantees to reassure them of their support as well as encourage them to include SAC in their programs.</p><p>In the past, the humanitarian field has failed to act on increasing access to safe abortion care. However, growing consensus around SAC as a catalyst of gender equality and improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes should prompt each humanitarian agency and government to take concrete steps toward field-wide change.</p>",

      "title": "Full choice, full access: a new strategy for delivering safe abortion and post-abortion care",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally, 214 million women have an unmet need for modern contraception. It is estimated that 40% of pregnancies worldwide are unintended, and of these, 50% result in abortion. Between 2010 and 2014, 56 million induced abortions occurred each year. An estimated 25 million abortions take place unsafely each year, due to legal restrictions and other barriers to safe services. These unsafe abortions result in 22,800–31,000 deaths annually.</p><p>Marie Stopes International (MSI) believes that every woman has the right to access a high quality, confidential, client-centred safe abortion. MSI provides safe abortion services within the fullest extent of local legal frameworks, and provides post-abortion care to ensure immediate life-saving care is available to women suffering complications from unsafe abortion.</p><p>To further its mission to eliminate unsafe abortion and ensure women can have children by choice, not chance, MSI has developed a new safe abortion and post-abortion care strategy that responds to the changing global environment. Mechanisms for delivering safe abortion and post-abortion care have been transformed over the past two decades by new technologies such as medical abortion medications; mobile phones and digital health; and widening definitions of abortion providers through task-sharing.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>A new strategy for safe abortion and post-abortion care was developed, with the objective to improve access to high quality, client-centred care, and reduce use of unsafe abortion methods and providers. The resulting ‘continuum of care’ strategy is a framework that supports country programmes to replicate evidence-based best practice, and encourages innovation and learning.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The strategy was developed between 2016-2017 through a review of global evidence on safe abortion and post-abortion care, service statistics, and programme experiences and best practice.</p><p>The review of global evidence included descriptive evidence on barriers to safe abortion and post-abortion care, evaluations of interventions to improve access to safe, high quality abortion care, and evidence on the scale of the need for abortion care.</p><p>Global service statistics were reviewed, to assess how the number of women accessing safe abortion and post-abortion care has varied over time and by geography and delivery mechanism.</p><p>Programme experiences and best practices were recorded through a series of interactive facilitated workshops, where representatives from country programmes could share examples of success and lessons learned through group discussions and activities. Examples and case studies were recorded, and the strength of the evidence behind the case studies were evaluated, to assess the strength of the recommendation.</p><p>The strategy was communicated through MSI’s 37 country programmes, and each individual country programme re-developed the global strategy according to their local context.  </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Three pillars were identified as critical to eliminating unsafe abortion: 1) a knowledge revolution to deliver awareness of services and a referral network; 2) expanded numbers of safe access points for women to receive products and services without judgement; and 3) scale with integrity and leveraged sector expertise.</p><p>The knowledge revolution pillar seeks to address the lack of reliable information about rights, entitlements and options. Abortion is highly stigmatised, and legally restricted in many countries, meaning that communities often have limited awareness of safe methods or providers. Smart communications campaigns, extensive referral networks supported by a central digital referral hub, and mechanisms to provide a continuum of care for self-managed medical abortion are needed.</p><p>Expanding access points for safe services and products is critical. This means increasing the number of safe providers and sales points through clinical training, values clarification and attitude transformation, and on-the-job clinical, legal and psychosocial support. Mapping service points can identify unsafe providers, who can be supported to refer to safe services or be converted to safe providers. Evidence-informed pricing strategies and mechanisms to ensure that no woman is turned away because she cannot afford to pay are required.</p><p>Finally, scale up of access must be delivered with quality and integrity, by supporting providers, and influencing markets to ensure quality products are available. Sector expertise must be leveraged by working in partnership, and bringing evidence and service delivery experience to advocate to governments to reduce the legal and clinical barriers that drive women to unsafe abortion.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>In summary, the strategy highlights the importance of a knowledge revolution for women and girls, increased access to safe services and products, underpinned by excellent quality care and working in partnership to remove restrictions. To expand access to safe abortion and post-abortion care, service delivery organisations must ensure that women can access services and products in places and ways that meet their needs through varied delivery methods; build a continuum of care to support women from pregnancy discovery through to abortion completion and choice of contraceptive uptake; and use evidence to innovate, evaluate and ensure that best practices are replicated. Service delivery organisations must continue to push boundaries to de-stigmatise abortion; and bring the voices of women to inform policy debates and influence legislative, policy and regulatory environments to uphold women’s right to safe abortion.</p><p>By 2020 there will be more women of reproductive age than ever before, and we are still a long way from all women having a real choice of options for safe, comprehensive abortion and post-abortion care, especially for the poorest, youngest and most vulnerable women who are being left behind. This strategy outlines the steps service delivery organisations can take to ensure that safe options become a reality for all women, and to create a world where no woman or girl ever dies from unsafe abortion.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Abortion is criminalized under most circumstances in Argentina. A group of feminist activists, the Socorristas en Red, offer information about the safe use of medications for abortion and support services to women seeking abortion in their first and second trimesters. It is essential to understand how these feminist accompaniment models can support women, and how they can help improve the services received by women in the health system, especially in contexts where abortion is not legal and women fear a risk to their safety if they disclose their abortion to health professionals.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This qualitative study aimed to understand women’s experiences having second-trimester medication abortions with the support of the Soccoristas. Specific aims include understanding women’s experiences with health professionals before, during, and after their abortion.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Over the course of approximately six months, we conducted in-depth interviews with 23 women who had second-trimester abortions outside of the formal health sector accompanied by Socorristas in Argentina. Interviews lasted between approximately 45 minutes and an hour and a half. We used a semi-structured interview guide which included questions about reproductive history, decision to have an abortion, experience with the Socorristas, experiences with the health system before, during, and after her abortion, and the abortion process itself. A codebook was developed based on key themes identified in the interview guide, as well as inductive codes that emerged after reading the transcripts. We conducted a thematic analysis to understand women's experiences during their care-seeking experiences and identify if and how women decided to access medical care during their abortion process and how health professionals responded to them. This study was approved by the Allendale Investigational Review Board.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>When women disclosed their abortion intentions to health professionals, some provided emotional support and referrals to the Socorristas, while those who did not support women’s decisions admonished them and warned of serious health consequences—causing women to worry more for their safety. Most women sought post-abortion care; several women felt a health professional was trustworthy and shared with the health professional that they had taken medication to induce abortion. Many women reported fearing legal repercussions when seeking care, and did not share that they used medication. During their care-seeking, some reported receiving empathic and respectful treatment, while others reported receiving poor treatment, in several cases because they were suspected of inducing abortion. Most health professionals who provided  supportive care had previously established relationships with the Socorristas.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These findings illustrate how feminist activists can help build bridges with the health system to ensure that providers understand women’s circumstances, their legal rights, and will provide supportive care to women. It demonstrates that for women who have abortions in restrictive settings, supportive health professionals can help to ensure that women feel comfortable accessing clinical services before and after their abortion.</p>",

      "title": "Development and Validation of a Psychometric Scale to Assess Clients’ Perceptions of Quality of Family Planning Services",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Over the past three decades, client-centred care has been promoted as a central tenet of rights-based family planning (FP) programming. A critical aspect of client-centred care is our ability to measure clients’ perspectives on the quality of care they have been provided. Existing approaches to client feedback on quality derive from traditional ‘structure-process-outcome’ conceptualisations of quality, and instruments gather ratings on multiple aspects of service delivery which have been deemed by researchers or programme managers to be important to clients. These including ratings on aspects of both clinical and inter-personal care, and the resulting outputs may be summed, somewhat simplistically, to provide an overall aggregate measure of quality. This approach has commonly been applied in health facility surveys, for example the global client exit interview employed by Marie Stopes International. It is unknown, however, whether these indicators are important to clients themselves, whether they apply in all contexts, and whether they robustly load onto (or predict) an overall measure of client-reported quality.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aims to develop and validate a parsimonious psychometric scale to evaluate clients’ perception of family planning (FP) service quality in peri-urban and rural areas of Pakistan. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study utilised a mixed-methods design. 48 focus group discussions (FGDs) were first conducted with married women of reproductive age (MWRA) (15-49 years) residing in peri-urban and rural areas of Punjab province to elicit opinions on different aspects of FP service quality. Based on the themes identified, psychometric scale items were developed to measure each dimension of service quality. These items were reviewed by quality of care experts and ascertained the relevance of the item against the aspect of quality the item was purported to measure. In 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among 2,144 MWRA exiting from family planning services (including counselling). Respondents were sampled consecutively from 336 facilities. The questionnaire included 35 client-reported quality items, recorded on five-point Likert-type scales. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) were subsequently used to refine and validate the scales. Ordinal alpha, composite reliability, and convergent validity established reliability and validity for the final factors. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to test how subdimensions of perceived quality relate to the overarching factor of perceived quality.  The model’s goodness of fit was evaluated using root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (.95).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Four thematic areas were identified through FGDs: Perceived Accessibility, Perceived Functional Quality, Perceived Technical Quality, and Perceived Physical Infrastructure Quality. We developed 35 psychometric items to measure the identified dimensions. In EFA, a four-factor solution was optimal, with the eigenvalue of each &gt;1. The extracted factors aligned with the four identified dimensions, and their measurement validity was confirmed through CFA. Items that yielded factor loadings below 0.5 or were conceptually redundant were removed from the scale., The final scale consisted of 12 items, with each factor measured by three items. All four factors were highly reliable, with Ordinal Alphas and Composite Reliability &gt;0.8. The final measurement model was a good fit [CFI = 0.989, RMSEA = 0.053]. All dimensions of quality were highly correlated with each other, confirming the hypothesis that all four dimensions are products of a singular hierarchical factor. The hierarchical model yielded a good fit as well [CFI = 0.989, RMSEA = 0.052]. We accepted the hierarchical model as our final model. The hierarchical factor explained 13% of the variance in perceived accessibility, 82% of the variance in perceived functional quality, 74% of the variance in perceived technical quality, and 56% of the variance in perceived physical infrastructure quality.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study responded to the growing interest in client-centred care by developing an empirical scale to measure clients’ perceived family planning service quality. The parsimonious scale is comprised of 12 items that measure four dimensions of quality. These dimensions aligned well with the themes identified from the initial exploratory qualitative study and provide information on ‘structural’ and ‘procedural’ care. The validated framework conceptually aligns with general and family planning service quality frameworks, with the exception of the inclusion of perceived accessibility in the framework. Though the variance explained for accessibility is low, in absolute terms, perceived accessibility does have an impact on MWRA’s perceptions of quality, and therefore is an integral component of the framework for client-centred evaluation of perceptions of quality. The perceived quality scale developed and validated through this study is a brief and simple tool that has the potential to be used for routine service quality monitoring and evaluation. As testing confirmed a hierarchical model, this suggests that a composite perceived quality score can be created from the 12 scale items. Moving forward, the efficacy of this tool can be further tested by comparing its results with observed quality scores for individual providers and identify specific areas of improvement for service providers. Furthermore, this tool can be used to understand the impact of clients’ perceptions of quality on client volume at facilities, and potentially on method continuation rates.</p>",

      "title": "Development and Validation of the Client-Reported Quality of Contraceptive Counseling Scale",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The international family planning field has been at the forefront of prioritizing quality in healthcare service delivery, motivated in large part by recognition that positive client experiences—in particular related to the communication between providers and clients about method options—are essential to acceptance and use of contraceptive methods.  Quality of care has been widely measured and monitored since the early 1990’s using tools derived from the seminal Bruce-Jain framework. However, existing tools to measure client experience communicating with the provider are insufficient in several ways. First, widely-used questions on exit interview tools tend to focus on receipt of information and are limited in their ability to measure the interpersonal aspects of care. Second, these tools frame questions about client experience positively, without any direct probes for whether mistreatment or coercion of women occurred—a striking omission given the burgeoning context of human rights based service delivery guidelines and advances in the maternal health field related to measuring disrespectful care. Finally, existing measurement tools have not been assessed for reliability and validity; the extent to which they provide precise, unbiased measurement of clients’ experiences with counseling in different settings is largely unknown.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We sought to contribute to efforts to improve measurement of women’s experiences with contraceptive services in this new era of rights-based service delivery by creating the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale. The scale’s development was grounded in best practices for counseling from quality and human rights perspectives, in an effort to create a measurement tool with potential universal applicability. In order to ensure its relevance in Mexico, where it was developed and validated, item composition was based on prior research by our team into women’s expressed preferences for contraceptive care in that country.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>                We refined an initial set of 35 QCC scale items via cognitive interviews with 29 clients in primary healthcare clinics in Mexico City and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. We then fielded 499 exit surveys to reduce the item pool and validate the scale, recruiting in 16 public clinics and two hospitals to maximize variability in terms of provider counseling approach. Survey participants were followed-up at 1-2 months post-visit to assess the association between quality scores and short-term contraceptive use and needs. Data collection took place in 2016-2017.</p><p>The factor structure of the scale was assessed using exploratory factor analysis. Individual item properties were examined using item response theory (IRT). These analyses were used to iteratively reduce the item pool and construct the final 22-item QCC scale, using data from San Luis Potosí. Considerations of content validity, drawing upon the measurement framework to make sure the full range of the QCC construct was covered, were central to decisions about item removal. We then conducted confirmatory analyses to assess whether the reduced scale performed consistently in Mexico City, using confirmatory factor analysis and IRT. Convergent, divergent, and predictive validity were examined through analyses of the correlation of QCC scores with external variables.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We conducted 242 surveys in Mexico City and 257 in San Luis Potosí between February-July 2017. We reached 60% (n=207) of the 70% (n=347) of women who agreed to be reached for phone follow-up. On a scale of 1-4, individual item scores averaged between 2.9 and 4.0, and the average composite score across cities was 3.5. The three dimensions identified in exploratory factor analysis were Information Exchange, Interpersonal Relationship, and Disrespect/Abuse; these dimensions were reproduced in the separate Mexico City sample. Correlations between factors were acceptable for considering the latent construct unidimensional for purposes of producing composite scores. Information Exchange factor (10 items) and Relationship factor (7 items) were highly correlated (Pearson coefficient=0.7) in analyses combining the two cities’ data. The Disrespect/Abuse factor (5 items) correlated 0.3 with Information Exchange and 0.4 with Interpersonal Relationship. IRT modeling produced an acceptable range of item difficulties and discrimination levels. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92 overall and between 0.76-0.91 for sub-scales.</p><p>Using a series of correlation analyses between QCC scores and external variables hypothesized to be related or unrelated to the QCC construct, we established convergent, predictive, and divergent validity of the QCC scale. Notably, QCC scores were highly correlated with the global measure of experience with provider (OR=22.6; p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The QCC scale is valid and reliable for measuring women’s experiences with contraceptive counseling in Mexico. The scale produced a good spread of scores, which makes it useful for comparing quality scores over time and across settings. The three related dimensions of the scale—Information Exchange, Interpersonal Relationship, and Disrespect/Abuse—cover a broader construct than is typically captured in survey instruments capturing client experience with contraceptive care; thus the scale provides a useful tool for comprehensively measuring quality and rights.  The ability to produce both composite as well as sub-scores enhances the utility of the QCC scale. QCC total scores and sub-scale scores can be used to bolster contraceptive counseling improvement efforts in Mexico, and their validity for use in India and Ethiopia is currently being assessed.</p><p>The robust measurement of client experience afforded by the QCC scale can be used for several purposes. First, QCC scale scores and sub-scores can be used to guide quality improvement efforts in health care systems and facilities. Second, they can be used for research purposes to investigate, on one hand, the determinants of positive client experiences with contraceptive care and, on the other hand, the impact of positive experiences on health and well-being. More longitudinal research is needed to better understand contraceptive use dynamics as well as the impacts of high quality healthcare service delivery. The QCC provides a tool to facilitate such research.</p>",

      "title": "Patient-Provider Trust: Findings from the Assessing Service Quality and Contraceptive Discontinuation (ASQ-D) Study in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Health systems involve interactions between patients and providers (Gilson, 2003).  The decision to seek out medical services requires some level of trust by the patient that the health care provider is acting in their best interest. A number of studies have been conducted on the concept of provider trust, largely in developed country contexts, and have found that it is associated with a number of improved health interactions and outcomes in different health areas (Gopichandran et al. 2015).</p><p>Provider trust is typically measured through a multi-dimensional construct that incorporates a number of aspects of the patient’s experience with the provider, including confidentiality, competence, fidelity, and honesty, among others (Hall et al. 2001). These particular dimensions are not consistently measured in studies on FP service quality and do not usually benefit from a comprehensive trust scale.</p><p>Research conducted at social franchises in Nepal found that two of the main reasons clients selected a franchise were patient knowledge of the provider and the provider’s caring manner (Agha &amp; Balal 2003). Yet evidence is scant within developing country contexts around provider trust and, in particular, the link between provider trust and health outcomes, such as contraceptive continuation.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The theoretical domains of trust established in the literature have largely only been validated among populations in developed countries. We use exploratory factor analysis using a wide range of questions to understand whether the same domains of trust are present among a select sample of Ugandan contraceptive users at social franchise clinics.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We use data from a 12-month prospective cohort study (ASQ-D) in Uganda among 1054 women aged 15-49 from 30 ProFram social franchise clinics who adopted a contraceptive method at the time of the visit. Women were interviewed at baseline and at 3.5, 6.5, 9.5, and 12.5 months after their visit.</p><p>The survey tool included 19 questions intended to measure participants’ trust of their provider. These questions were selected and modified from prior studies and were intended to reflect established theoretical domains of trust: fidelity, competence, honesty, confidentiality, and reputation. We use exploratory factor analysis to identify domains of trust within our data, map them to the five theoretical domains, and test for internal consistency within each of the identified factors.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Using cut-off criteria for factor retention of eigenvalue&gt;1 along with an examination of the resulting scree plot, four factors were retained from the analysis. We used a relaxed cut-off for factor loadings, as is typical in exploratory factor analysis, of 0.5 to identify eight items for factor 1, three items for factor 2, three items for factor 3, three items for factor 4, and two items that did not load on any factor.</p><p>After a review of the items loading on to each factor, we mapped three theoretical trust domains to the factors: fidelity, reputation, and competence. The fourth factor was dropped as it contained all questions that were reverse coded, suggesting a possible translation or misinterpretation problem. There were no items that mapped to a confidentiality domain or to an honesty domain. Hall et al recognize that there is overlap between honesty and fidelity and, indeed, the questions directly related to honesty, such as ‘my provider was honest about which family planning options were available to me’ are included in factor 1, fidelity.</p><p>We then tested the identified factors for internal consistency and found factors 1, fidelity, and 2, reputation, to be highly reliable (α=0.84 and α=0.81, respectively) while factor 3, competence, less so (α=0.56).</p><p>The next step in the analysis will be to test associations between the measures of trust and contraceptive discontinuation at 6 and 12 months; results of this will be included in the full paper and presentation.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>While woman often cite the reason for choosing a particular health clinic as related to some characteristic of the provider, provider trust is less well understood in the low- and middle-income countries. The results of our analysis suggest that several established theoretical domains of trust, fidelity, reputation, and confidence, resonated among our sample of Ugandan contraceptive users (it is important to note that our sample is not representative of the broader population of Uganda women or contraceptive users). These domains of trust have been previously found to be associated with positive health outcomes; whether these domains of trust are also associated with contraceptive continuation remains to be seen but, if so, the implications for clinic supportive supervision and quality assurance are critical to understand as trust is a less tangible concept to target for improvement.</p>",

      "title": "What do women want? Redefining quality of care in abortion service delivery",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The World Health Organization defines quality of care domains as services that are safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable and people-centered. Measurement of quality is necessary to improve existing services and expand access to high-quality care around the globe. In abortion service provision, quality of care is predominately measured through clinical indicators, driven by service providers' view of quality. There is little known about women’s perspective on abortion quality of care. While most abortion facilities measure client satisfaction in some form, these assessments pose a unique set of challenges. Clients are often limited in their choice of where to access abortion services and therefore any abortion service can be welcome for a woman with an unwanted pregnancy, influencing her expectations and perception of the quality of the service provided. In addition, the internalization of abortion stigma may lead women to believe they do not deserve quality abortion care. Greater understanding is needed of what women want from a quality abortion service, and how to accurately measure this at the point of service delivery.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This qualitative study aimed to better understand women’s concerns and expectations prior to obtaining abortion care, to explore women’s perception of quality abortion services and what aspects of quality they prioritize, and to consider connections between stigma and quality of care.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2017, IPPF, in collaboration with Ibis Reproductive Health, conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with abortion clients in Kenya and India about their perceptions of quality of care and their experiences seeking and obtaining abortion services. Women were also asked to describe the best and worst healthcare they have received and what constituted a service that was high-quality, respectful, or satisfactory. Each participant was also asked to identify three components of abortion care that were most important to them. In Kenya, we conducted 24 interviews with women in two cities. In India, we conducted 10 interviews, and two focus group discussions with 11 women. Participants were between 18-49 years of age and had reported having at least one prior abortion. For analysis, we created a codebook, carried out an iterative coding process, and conducted a thematic analysis. We identified relevant themes and patterns, considered similarities and differences across the two countries, and assessed priority aspects of quality among this sample. We used the Donabedian model as a framework for analysis which assesses quality of health care through structure, process and outcome domains.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The majority of women in both India and Kenya reported that they had low expectations of the abortion experience and the care they would receive. These women described fears about the safety, experience, and completion of the procedure, as well as stigmatizing treatment by providers. Most women had little or no knowledge about abortion prior to seeking care. For many women in both countries, this lack of knowledge and misinformation was a source of fear and worry when thinking about receiving abortion services. Women identified a range of aspects of care which they perceived as high quality. They discussed aspects of care in five categories: communication and information provision, interactions with provider and staff, technical skills and competency of the service provider, clinic infrastructure and available services, and abortion procedure and outcomes. The aspects of high-quality abortion care that were most important to women in this study included 1) kind and caring providers, 2) appropriate care provided 3) clear explanations and accurate information in preparation for the procedure, and 4) availability of follow-up services. Despite similarities across the sample, there were various differences between the countries. Women in Kenya expressed more fear about severe complications from the procedure and stigma from the providers. They expressed more concern about how young women might be treated when seeking abortion. In India, women were focused on access to accurate information and preparedness for the procedure. They identified increased stigma and barriers faced by unmarried women seeking care.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The findings provide programme managers and clinic staff with a greater understanding of the needs and wishes of women seeking abortion care. This knowledge will assist in the better design and delivery of programme interventions and services that meet women’s needs. The findings have also informed the development of indicators to enable service providers to assess and improve quality of care in abortion service delivery.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Despite evidence supporting Sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) as a strategy to improve outcomes in countries with high maternal mortality, Kenya face challenges related to lack of training, gaps necessary supporting health systems.</p><p>These constraints lead to health care workers’ inability to consistently translate sexual reproductive health and rights knowledge, and skills into practice.  There is lack of a program providing mentoring and enhanced supervision at health centers focusing on clinical and systems improvement. KMET implemented clinical mentorship in 22 facilities in Western Kenya as a strategy to address these issues, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of services.</p><p>Provision of comprehensive quality health care services requires training and mentorship, irrespective of the individual providing services. Clinical mentorship is aimed at improving the skills and knowledge of health care practitioners.  In Kenya the health system lacks a system of practical training and consultation that fosters ongoing professional development of mentees to deliver sustainable high-quality clinical care.  Although clinical mentorship guidelines have been developed they are not seen as part of continued professional development required to create competent care providers</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>KMET Implements clinical mentorship in Kisumu, Siaya and Migori Counties and supported 22 facilities in mentorship. A mentorship guide for providing oversight, coordination and support to mentorship activities developed for utilization by public and private facilities. KMET included MOH representatives for continuous discharge of responsibility and as the sole regulator and coordinator of health services. The MOH supervised and offered technical support to providers. The program had mentors who formed the County Mentorship support unit (CMSU) who were official from the MOH and had expertise in sexual reproductive health provision. The program ensured that mentorship skills: clinical mastery in  contraceptive provision, guidance and problem-solving skills, adherence to applicable clinical standards, guidelines, protocols and reporting and documentation were among selected mentors</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>KMET trained MOH reproductive health coordinators as mentors and set up County mentorship Support unit (CMSU) who were responsible for mentorship and support needs and developed a suitable work plan to implement activities with providers. The mentors trained 66 providers on family planning services with focus on long acting reversible contraceptive methods. The providers were provided continuous mentorship sessions based on need basis. The mentorship assistance recorded in mentorship supervision tools.  Providers were tasked with responsibility of doing 20 LARC procedure (10 implants and 10 IUCD insertions) own their own to attain competency</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A pool of 10 mentors established across the counties of intervention. A mentorship guide developed that had mentorship plan and data collection tools.

      "title": "CyberNurse Rwanda: Design Research and Rapid Prototyping ​of​ Provider Tools ​to Improve​​ Youth Friendly Sexual Health Services ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Over the past decade, Rwanda has made vast improvements to ensure equitable access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. While successful at reaching married women and families, these services often fail to reach unmarried Rwandan youth. Nearly half (47%) of all pregnancies in the country are unintended and only 12% of sexually active adolescents use contraception. In 2016, primary research conducted by YLabs and YTH in Rwanda found that youth rely on their peers, internet, and social media for sexual health information, much of which is inaccurate. Sexual health services provided in schools or clinics focus heavily on condoms and abstinence, and did not offer comprehensive, unbiased care to unmarried youth. Insights from health workers revealed substantial provider bias towards the kinds of methods and counselling, if any, would be suitable for unmarried youth. To address this, YLabs, YTH, and SFH Rwanda are taking a user-centered design approach to better understand provider-side barriers to delivering comprehensive SRH services to unmarried youth, and to design new solutions to improve quality of care and increase youth demand for family planning.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What are the social and structural barriers service providers face in providing quality SRH services to unmarried Rwandan youth? What innovations can we design to improve the quality of care that youth receive, and thereby increase youth demand for SRH services?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>During February 2018, the team conducted user-centered design research activities with service providers in two urban and peri-urban districts in Rwanda: Kigali and Huye. Qualitative research tools integrated ethnographic methodologies and included semi-structured interviews, participatory activities, co-design workshops and example concepts to gauge knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and current practices regarding SRH service provision to unmarried youth. Through 18 in-depth interviews, 10 focus group discussions, and one co-design workshop, the team interviewed 47 community health workers, nurses, pharmacists, doctors, youth coordinators, and youth. The team also tested initial, low-fidelity digital and non-digital prototypes that aimed to assess provider knowledge on different contraceptive methods through interactive games, provided video testimonials from influential stakeholders on the merits of providing contraception to youth, and simulated professional chat forums aimed at sharing best practices and addressing misconceptions around youth service provision.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Since 2016, there have been multiple national initiatives to improve providers’ capacity and behavior to offer all available contraceptive services to youth in order address the high rates of unplanned pregnancy. Research findings suggest that these initiatives have made progress towards improving service provision for youth, yet despite these efforts, youth uptake of clinic services remains low. Focus group discussions with youth revealed that the risk of exposure waiting in line for SRH services at the clinic was unbearable and presented a fundamental barrier towards service uptake for unmarried youth. As a result, youth unanimously reported a reliance on pharmacies for contraceptive products. Qualitative data show that pharmacists see more youth clients than any other providers (nearly as many youth per week as clinicians report seeing per month) because of the quick and discrete service offered to youth.</p><p>Given the pervasive stigma associated with engaging in premarital sex, providers reported that youth are dishonest about their intentions for obtaining contraception. Seeking oral contraception (OCP) would be an admission of ‘planning’ to engage in this stigmatized practice; as a result, youth reported that they commonly opt to use emergency contraception (EC) to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex, as they perceive this as more socially acceptable. Furthermore, qualitative data from youth reveal that they commonly create false narratives to explain their reasons for purchasing contraception, often claiming it’s for an older family member. This often inhibits provider capacity to offer accurate messaging on correct dosage and side effects of the OCP and EC. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>A fundamental learning from this work has been the need to design service-delivery approaches to meet youth where they are: at their preferred entry points in the health system. While there have been national efforts to improve clinician’s capacity to deliver comprehensive SRH care to young people, youth are drawn to the quick and discreet service provided by pharmacies. However, pharmacists lack training for contraceptive counseling for youth, leading them to rely upon cultural norms and biases to guide their service provision. Though pharmacists’ line of questions and counselling are guided by norms and stigmas regarding adolescent contraceptive use, they demonstrated eagerness to better understand, connect, and serve their youth clients.</p><p>The application of a user-centered design approach allowed the team to generate comprehensive user insights into the intricacies of youth’s engagement of the health system, a more nuanced understanding of the structural and social barriers providers have towards service provision for unmarried youth, and finally, how to design solutions to enhance service delivery approaches across a spectrum of healthcare providers to offer youth accurate, quality, and unbiased SRH care. By November, the team will share an implementation strategy and final set of solutions (tested, iterated, and developed with providers) that will build off these insights. These solutions will be designed to enable pharmacists to deliver accurate, expedited, and trusted services to youth and support providers’ desire to guide responsible contraceptive use and increased choice for youth.</p>",

      "title": "Digital contraceptive counselling to improve provider and client experience and perceptions of counselling for contraceptive choice",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Multiple barriers constrain a woman’s ability to choose and use a contraceptive method suited to her lifestyle, physical needs and personal preferences. Key barriers are insufficient knowledge of which methods are available and how they work and lack of quality client-centred counselling to explain how different methods may be suitable. Through experience and research, Marie Stopes International (MSI) has observed that: (1) unanticipated side effects are a primary reason for discontinuation; (2) women choose methods they have heard of or were recommended to them rather than those that suit their lifestyle and fertility preferences; (3) providers may limit counselling to a woman’s initial preference without discussing other suitable methods; or (4) counselling can be didactic unresponsive to the individual and/or overwhelming in the volume of information on unsuitable methods, leading to clients’ confusion or decision paralysis.</p><p>Recognizing these barriers, and given MSI's commitment to put the client at the centre of service delivery, we developed a needs-based (rather than method-based) digital job aid, the Digital Counselling Application (DCA), in 2015. This tool, based on World Health Organization decision logic for contraceptive safety, is designed for providers to use during family planning (FP) counselling in a collaborative, client-centred approach.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The intervention studied consisted of MSI provider training on use of the DCA and a refresher course in client-centred counselling. The DCA is designed to improve the selection of methods comprehensively addressed in counselling to suit the specific client. Using the tablet-based app, the provider and client go through a series of questions and visual aids assessing lifestyle, needs, acceptable side effects and medical eligibility for contraceptive methods. The output is a ranked list of methods, with pros and cons, reflecting the client’s responses, that informs a personalised provider–client discussion of the top three methods.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We tested the intervention tool, which was translated into local languages, in 11 randomly selected Marie Stopes clinics in Vietnam and 24 in Ethiopia in 2016 and 2017. Intended beneficiaries of the intervention were: FP service providers at these clinics, with the aim of improving their skills in counselling clients using the DCA; and clients, women ages 15–49 years, receiving FP counselling, specifically those not currently using an FP method (adopters) or thinking of changing to a new method (switchers).</p><p>As part of a larger study, including an RCT, we conducted in-depth interviews with 12 providers and 10 female clients (ages 18–49), split evenly between the clinics in Vietnam and Ethiopia following three months of testing.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Due to higher than expected baseline measures and issues with client recruitment and follow-up, the RCT was ultimately underpowered to detect a significant effect on method choice, provider recommendation of LAPM, or client’s experience.</p><p>The in-depth interviews indicated that three months after training, providers largely reported having adapted to using the DCA, with its user-friendly design, and felt that it modernised their counselling. Counsellors reported more readily developed rapport with clients thanks to the side-by-side seating arrangement while using the tablet. Further, providers noted that the DCA encouraged clients to ask questions not raised in non-DCA counselling sessions. With continued use, providers became confident in rephrasing the DCA’s questions to be more sensitive and culturally appropriate and counselling became more streamlined as they became familiar with question content and sequence.</p><p>Challenges cited by providers included: having to report counselling sessions on a separate platform; difficulty using the DCA on busy days; and unsuitability for clients who already had a strong preference or had come for repeat prescriptions.</p><p>Clients welcomed the modern technology, saying providers were capable and confident in their use of the DCA. They felt the FP counselling was comfortable and focused, providers were trustworthy, and there was adequate time and flexibility for discussion. The providers’ DCA-prompted questions were considered appropriate. Although most clients reported gaining knowledge, and a few clients felt the DCA assisted them in making an informed decision, several clients expressed some anxiety when the DCA output suggested methods not aligned with their preconceived preferences.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Findings from the testing process suggest that the DCA could be a suitable and feasible tool for use as part of an FP provider’s suite of counselling aids, helping providers to tailor their counselling and choice of job aids to both their own and their clients’ needs. Research to date has not yet been able to demonstrate the DCA’s ability to have a significant impact on method mix. As balanced method mix is critical, future research into the potential ability of the DCA to overcome client- and provider-side bias for or against particular methods should be conducted.  </p><p>Further, additional testing should aim to establish the DCA’s suitability to improve client-centred counselling across the different cadres and capacities of health staff, client profiles, and service provision settings. In consideration of this, and the characteristics of the DCA in terms of provider ease of use, client acceptance and quality of client-centred counselling, there is potential scope for further expansion of testing with non-clinical personnel in community-based mobilisation and awareness-raising. In this implementation, the DCA would be positioned to explore and inform clients on which FP methods may be best suited for their fertility preferences, medical eligibility, and lifestyle. Upon completion of further testing, the DCA and associated training would be integrated into appropriate channels of delivery as part of a suite of job and communication aids to ensure services meet our provider and client needs.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Maternal mortality among Afghan women is high, standing at 661 in 2015 and CPR is very low, standing at 20% in 2015. Women in Afghanistan face a lifetime risk of death from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. Training and deploying professional birth attendants is considered to be the most critical intervention for safe motherhood and reduction of neonatal mortality. Currently, there are 5000 community midwives in the country, and we are facing with a shortage of midwives. UNFPA realized that due to the pressing needs, trained midwives were immediately deployed to work in the field after graduation without any mentorship to enhance their practical skills. However, midwives reported the need to acquire expert advice to manage complicated cases. Thus there is a need for 24/7 services to assist midwives during their practices when they face challenges to support maternal and newborn emergency cases or either has queries about reproductive and family planning services.</p><p>To provide technical information, consultation and guidance to health service providers in particularly midwives working in very remote and insecure area during their practices, UNFPA and the Ministry of Public Health jointly initiated in 2016 the Midwifery Help Line (MHL)</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Midwifery Help Line (MHL) is a toll-free helpline available 24/7 to provide online technical information, consultation, and guidance to midwives during their practices whenever they faced challenges they can call free of cost from any part of the country. The MHL will enable midwives to provide quality Family Planning ,Maternal and Newborn services for saving lives.</p><p>The objective of MHL is to assist the midwives in informed decision making on complex maternal and Family Planning cases while on duty</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Midwifery Help Line is a toll-free helpline functional 24/7 and operates by two gynecologists and two midwives at Rabia Balkhi Maternity Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. MoPH is the owner of MHL and they will use their stewardship role to support MHL services. The call center is equipped with guidelines and job aids to provide up to date information and consultation to midwives need urgent support, or either has queries about reproductive and family planning services the.</p><p>Midwifery helpline has a database recording all caller information and types of queries. By the end of each quarter, the MHL data analyzing by the Ministry of Public Health and it gives a picture of midwives support, and training needs to facilitate quality RMNCH service delivery.</p><p>Currently, primary health services are available in most of the health facilities in a specific period usually from 8:00 to 14:00 pm.  Midwife alone may scare to provide services without backstop by another technical staff. The MHL offers technical backstop for midwives to offer RMNCH and FP services in case they face any challenge during the absence of other staff in the health facility, and it will encourage 24/7 service delivery in the health facilities</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The MHL has responded to 3551 calls from the public and private health facilities across the country. 86% of calls were from midwives followed by medical doctors (3.5%), and 10% other health workers. 57% of call recorded during the daily official time while 43%  between 05:00 PM- 07:00 AM.  36% of calls requested from CHCs,  14% BHCs,9% DHs, 5% HSC, 5% from Family Health Houses and 11% from private health facilities, and 20% of calls asked for support from home when a midwife assisted a delivery or midwifery schools, and other institutions.</p><p>The majority of calls (22%) sought guidance on the management of delivery complications, e.g., prolong labor, malposition of baby, episiotomy, Laceration, and dosage of uterotonics. 12% of calls asked help on family planning, 5% of calls asked support on the management of Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia with focus on diluting and the use of Magnesium Sulphate.  Another 5% of calls asked help on the management of postpartum hemorrhage and 5% management of incomplete or threatened abortion and post-abortion management. The remaining 51% calls requested assistance on other issues such as hemorrhage during the pregnancy, newborn resuscitation, STI/UTI/PID, breast mass, fetal distress and shock management.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>MHL is useful and quick access to support and technical guidance for health workers in particular midwives working in very remote and insecure areas of the country where direct mentorship and on the job training of midwives by expert is not possible, The MHL gives confidence and skills to enable midwives to provide 24/7 maternal and newborn life-saving and FP services, also it guides timely and informed referral of complicated cases. It also guides the training plans around the critical needs identified by MHL database.</p><p>MHL provides need-based technical information to midwives, which will consequently improve the skill of the midwives to better manage maternal and newborn cases to enhance the quality of FP services and save lives.</p><p>Analyzing of the MHL data will give us information about the training needs of midwives and their needs will be fulfilled by providing need-based and tailored training.</p><p>In future midwifery helpline would be linked to Maternal and Newborn Death Surveillance and Response (MNDSR) and Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) to get an update and accurate data.</p><p>The MHL improve networking among midwives working in public or private health facilities, and MOPH can share update information or any other urgent issue with all midwives through MHL</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Youth Peer Providers (YPPs) are volunteers who serve as resources on improving health-seeking behavior amongst young people of their same age. Lwala Community Alliance (LCA) has been implementing this community-led health initiative since the year 2013 in the North Kamagambo area of Migori County, in western Kenya. YPPs encourage their peers to utilize family planning methods, increase awareness, and dispel myths and misconceptions. LCA invests in these volunteers by providing trainings and mentorship; however, turnover remains high, with many trained recruits leaving their posts prematurely. Some of the reasons that contribute to this include: Education: YPPs are between the ages of 18 to 24 years. Many of them just completed their fourth form and plann to continue with their education. Compensation: YPPs are provided with a stipend to facilitate travel and necessary mobile airtime; however, many have other financial obligations that eventually lead them to seek higher paying positions elsewhere. Marriage: Most YPPs are young and unmarried at the time they begin their service with Lwala, but often leave when they get married. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Lwala organized for a three-day training for YPPs on theater,and also holds a one-day mentorship session on a monthly basis. The team also developed a table banking group. The YPPs are now able to save the stipends they have and generate interest, allowing them to pay for things such as school fees. Lwala has also encouraged the YPPs to enroll in tertiary institutions around our catchment area, including Rongo University, Siala Institute,Lwala also considers the YPPs for any upcoming job opportunities, resulting in eight YPPs becoming employed by Lwala across different departments hence acting as an exit strategy for the youths.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To address these challenges Lwala collaborated with highly-engaged YPPs to develop activities that could keep less-engaged YPPs satisfied with the role they play in the community, as well as generate more income for them.Lwala organized for a three-day training for YPPs on theater (with health-seeking behavior being the focus of the content),and also holds a one-day mentorship session on a monthly basis. This has helped encouraged YPPs to remain involved with Lwala in a fun and engaging way, and has also provided them with the opportunity to generate income by acting at community events with their newfound skill set.The team also developed a table banking group. The YPPs are now able to save the stipends they have and generate interest, allowing them to pay for things such as school fees.Lwala has also encouraged the YPPs to enroll in tertiary institutions around our catchment area, including Rongo University, Siala Institute, which has enabled the YPPs further their education, become more resourceful and set a good example to fellow youths in the community.Lwala also considers the YPPs for any upcoming job opportunities, resulting in eight YPPs becoming employed.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Continuing education, including refresher trainings on family planning (FP) methods, quality counseling techniques, and other new developments in FP and reproductive health, ensures that health workers maintain and update their skills, improving the quality of services they provide clients. Traditional in-service trainings have proven to be costly and do not respond to the growing demand for customized, on-the-job training in low-resource settings. To meet this demand, the USAID-funded Knowledge for Health (K4Health) Project explored new ways to deliver free FP content from the Global Health eLearning Center (GHeL). While internet access and connectivity continues to be a challenge, more than three-quarters of all mobile cellular subscribers now live in low- and middle-income countries. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a technology that works with any type of mobile phone. It delivers information via audio recordings and, therefore, does not require a smartphone, internet connectivity, or even full literacy. Users can provide feedback by pressing a number key. K4Health implemented an IVR FP refresher course—also called the Family Planning Mobile Training Course—based on existing GHeL FP courses to improve FP-related knowledge for health workers in Kenya.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Students and health workers at the Kenya Medical Training College and the Kitui District Hospital first completed two GHeL FP courses. From September 2015- July 2016, these same participants (n=233) were invited to complete the FP Mobile Training Course at least six weeks after completing the GHeL courses to allow for some decline in memory retention over time. The FP Mobile Training Course included 20 audio questions with accompanying explanations using GHeL course content. Using spaced-education methodology, participants were required to answer each question correctly twice to pass the course and could answer up to four questions per call.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Before and after the Family Planning Mobile Training Course, participants were asked to complete baseline and endline knowledge assessment tests. Baseline scores were derived from scores from the two GHeL FP courses. A usability assessment was conducted at midline to inform K4Health as to participant’s motivations to take part in the FP Mobile Training Course, their overall likes and dislikes of the IVR training course, and suggestions for improvement. A total of 48 participants did not start the Family Planning Mobile Training Course, while 86 started but did not complete it. Because these two groups (n=134) were exposed to the IVR training course, but did not initiate or complete it, they were dropped from the analysis. Additionally, those participants that did not complete both the baseline and endline assessment were dropped from the analysis. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Among those who completed the baseline, endline, and FP Mobile Training Course (n=75), the mean scores increased significantly from 12.1 at baseline to 15.9 at endline (p <ul>\t<li>Participants who completed the training (n=75) spent an average of 22.6 days engaged in the IVR training, with an average call duration of 5.9 minutes.</li>\t<li>Participants who did not complete the training (n=86) spent an average of 8 days engaged in the IVR training, with an average call duration of 3.8 minutes.</li></ul><p>The midline usability assessment found that participants liked the training, found the content to be useful, and that receiving the training on their mobile phones via IVR was convenient.</p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>IVR is a low-cost and easy-to-use technology with the potential to reach a large number of health workers and students with FP information that can serve as a refresher to FP trainings or as a way to provide basic FP information. This project faced a number of implementation challenges similar to other distance learning initiatives, such as variable participation levels, as well as implementation challenges specific to IVR, related to varying familiarity with mobile devices. Discussing the findings from the Family Planning Mobile Training Course program will contribute to the understanding of how IVR can be used to build capacity of FP health workers and program implementers in remote areas that experience online connectivity challenges. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Au Burkina Faso, le gouvernement à travers le plan national d’accélération de la planification familiale (PF) 2017-2020 s’est fixée pour objectif de passer d’un taux de prévalence contraceptive de 22,5% en 2015 à 32 % en 2020. A cet effet un accent est mis sur le renforcement des ressources humaines. Plus de 800 sages-femmes sont déployés chaque année pour l’offre de service dont la planification familiale du postpartum (PFPP). Pour contribuer à la réalisation de cet objectif, Jhpiego en partenariat avec le ministère de la santé met en œuvre un projet dénommé « Extension durable de la planification familiale dans le postpartum ». Ce projet  dont le focus est l’intégration de la PFPP dans la formation de base des sages- femmes comporte également un volet  « suivi post déploiement » dans le but de renforcer les compétences des nouveaux diplômés pour l’offre de services de PF. Toutefois, vue le nombre très élevé de nouveaux diplômés et de sites à visiter, disposer d’un nombre suffisant de superviseurs constitue un défi majeur et plusieurs prestataires doivent attendre un temps relativement long pour bénéficier d’un suivi. Le mMentoring s’avère donc être une approche pouvant pallier efficacement à cette situation</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Le mMentoring mis en place par Jhpiego se veut être une approche innovante efficace et à moindre cout pouvant contribuer au suivi post formation des prestataires. Il a l’avantage de toucher plusieurs prestataires en même temps contrairement au suivi classique qui nécessite plusieurs équipes de superviseurs sur un temps relativement long.</p><p>L’intervention s’intéresse à deux cohortes de sages-femmes ayant validé leur formation en 2015 et en 2016. Elle a débuté en Aout 2017 par l’envoi de messages courts ou SMS pour rappeler des informations clés sur la PFPP et aussi de quiz pour évaluer les connaissances des prestataires. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Le mMentoring a concerné 402 sages-femmes diplômées en 2015 et 2016, et déployés dans 254 formations sanitaires dans toutes les régions sanitaires et équipées pour les services de PFPP incluant le dispositif intra-utérin (DIU) du postpartum. Pour renforcer le suivi des prestataires sur le terrain, Jhpiego a mis en place cette approche qui consiste à évaluer la rétention de leurs connaissances en PFPP et puis fournit des informations clés pour combler les insuffisances sur les techniques d’offre des méthodes notamment les méthodes de longue durée d’action. Les messages et les quiz concernent principalement les domaines tels que le counseling PFPP, les insertions du DIU et des implants, la prévention et contrôle des infections (PCI), ainsi que la collecte des données.  Le système utilise la plateforme Telerivet pour l’envoi des messages et la gestion des données. Pour lancer le mMentoring des messages de confirmation de numéros de téléphone et la volonté de participation des prestataires ont d’abord été envoyés.  Des messages d’annonces du mMentoring en PPFF expliquant l’objectif visé et les modalités de réponses ont ensuite été transmis aux nouveaux diplômés. Les messages sont envoyés par jour selon un calendrier préétabli alternant des messages de renforcement des connaissances et des quiz. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Au total, 402 prestataires  sages-femmes nouvellement diplômées ont reçu les messages du mMentoring sur la PFPP pendant la période d’Aout 2017 à Janvier 2018. Soixante-dix messages de renforcement de connaissances et 61 quiz ont été envoyés aux prestataires.Le taux moyen de participation aux quix etait de 41% avec un taux moyen de bonnes reponses a 86,94% . Deux évaluations ont été réalisées à 4 mois après le début du processus en collectant des informations sur les attentes des prestataires sur le mMentoring. L’analyse de ces données a permis d’identifier des lacunes en matière de connaissance sur la PFPP et des difficultés concernant les procédures de soins notamment la technique d’insertion du DIU et des implants, le respect des regèles de Prévention et contrôle des infections. Ces constats ont permis d’adapter les messages en prenant en compte les suggestions faites par les prestataires. L’introduction des quiz sur les cas cliniques en novembre 2017 a obtenu un taux de participation de 57% pour le quiz axé sur  l’offre du DIUPP en salle d’accouchement. </p><p>En termes d’offre de services PFPP, le lancement du mMentoring a contribué à  un accroissement du nombre de femmes recevant une méthode PF avant de quitter la maternité. En effet le pourcentage de femmes ayant accouché et conseillé sur la PFPP est passé de 53% d’avril à septembre 2016 à 72% pour la même période de l’année 2017. Le taux d’adoption d’une méthode contraceptive par les femmes est passé de 30% à 46% dans les mêmes périodes.</p>",

Le taux moyen de 86,94% de bonnes réponses aux quiz est un résultat montrant que l’intégration de la PFPP à l’école de formation de base est une approche efficace pour l’extension de l’offre des services. Les prestataires dans le feedback transmis via le mMentoring ont ressorti des aspects positifs de cette approche qu’ils souhaitent voir s’étendre à d’autres domaines d’offre de services comme les SONU, les soins postnatals et la lutte contre le VIH.</p><p>En outre, le mMentoring a permis d’identifier et de corriger des insuffisances dans la compréhension des procédures de soins incluant les règles de PCI et l’offre de méthodes contraceptives. Par ailleurs le mMentoring a permis d’identifier les lacunes dans le remplissage des supports de collecte de données. Des informations appropriées pour adresser cette situation ont été envoyés aux prestataires et gestionnaires de données des districts sanitaires.</p><p>Toutefois, une plus grande participation des prestataires aux quiz pourrait être obtenue si ceux-ci recevaient des crédits téléphoniques pour répondre aux questions ou si un numéro vert était mis en place. Le mMentoring permet de faire un suivi post formation d’un grand nombre de prestataires avec un minimum de temps et de ressources.</p><p>Le ministère de la santé pourrait s’approprier cette approche innovante de suivi post formation et l’utiliser dans tous les domaines de la santé.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The current trend towards decreasing lengths of patients’ visits to teaching hospitals reduces the possibilities for learners to observe the medical processes and procedures.  Limited number of providers in some countries also limits the possibility to see and practice first hand family planning consultations.  In this context, use of online technologies to support the learning process by simulations of clinical scenarios enables learning clinical problem-solving more efficiently.  A High-level Meeting organized by UNFPA Regional Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia in 2012 analyzed the factors influencing contraceptive access and utilization in several middle-income countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and recommended, among other, building the capacity of service providers in the region through the use of modern technologies, such as distance learning modules.  As a result, the UNFPA Regional Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia initiated the development of an online learning platform for evidence-based and rights-based family planning.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Virtual Contraceptive Consultation (ViC) (www.vic.eeirh.org) is an online learning platform for evidence-based and rights-based family planning, developed by the East European Institute for Reproductive Health and the UNFPA Regional Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, with the aim of strengthening the capacities of family planning service providers in the region.  ViC uses technical information from the World Health Organization cornerstones of family planning guidance and other sources, and provides e-learning which complements the traditional live family planning training courses and offers the flexibility and advantages of an online learning environment, easy to use and securely accessible anytime. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>ViC is structured into three main sections: Learn, Test and Practice.  After completing the Learn section, which contains technical information on family planning, users quiz themselves in the Test section on contraceptive methods and other family-planning subjects.  Quizzes extract questions from question banks in a randomized and shuffled way, and can be customized to reflect the needs of different learning groups.  The Practice section then asks learners to apply their knowledge in interactive simulations of real-life clinical scenarios, in which they must follow the correct steps of a contraceptive consultation and propose the best contraceptive options, based on the anonymous personal data, medical history, sexual and reproductive history, physical examination, and paraclinical investigations presented.  Clinical situations of various degrees of complexity can thus be practiced in a safe environment, with instant feedback and references to the relevant WHO family planning guidance.  By following through the initial and follow-up visits, learners gain up-to-date knowledge about modern contraceptives, counteracting outdated information, misinformation and biased personal opinions.  ViC is targeted primarily to family planning providers (primary health care physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists who manage family planning clients), but can be used also by residents and pre-graduate medical students training in family planning.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>ViC has been developed in two generic versions (in English and Russian languages) open to learners from any country/territory, and a growing number of language specific versions (currently Albanian, Bosnian, Georgian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Macedonian, Romanian, Tajik, Serbian), developed in partnership with key institutions and family planning experts in each target country/territory.  Content is being translated to these languages through collaboration with local institutions, so that learners can easily benefit from the platform in their language.  ViC’s multilingual capabilities ensure there are no linguistic limitations to learning family planning online.  As of April 2018, ViC has more than 700 users from 22 countries/territories and more than 500 certificates awarded.The ViC Learning Management System has a modular, scalable design, which allows it to be tailored to meet the needs of any country/territory, enabling it to be customized and institutionalized based on national accreditation and certification requirements, thus expanding the reach and increasing ownership.  The Learning Management System can be configured by enabling or disabling core features, and easily integrates everything needed for a course using its complete range of built-in features, including external collaborative tools such as forums, wikis, chats and blogs.  Upon successful completion, learners receive either generic certificates, or, in the target countries/territories, certificates issued in partnership with national institutions (e.g. medical universities, accreditation bodies, Ministries of Health) and are awarded credits/points in accordance with the respective national Continuing Medical Education systems.  Each certificate has a unique code which allows tracking the results and makes fraud impossible.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The Virtual Contraceptive Consultation (ViC) online learning platform is a unique multilingual tool that allows learners unrestricted opportunity to practice the contraceptive consultation in a risk-free environment, provides opportunities for trial-and-error and instant feedback on decisions, together with relevant references explaining the correct conduct.  Errors made by learners have no significant consequences, which enables less stressful learning.  ViC is been used both as an individual interactive learning tool, or as a component in a blended learning programme.  Using the Learn and Test sections online as a precondition prior to a live course allows training programmes to reduce time allocated to transmitting basic knowledge and increase time allocated to live activities aimed at building skills and attitudes.  Virtual consultations can be practiced not only individually, but also in a classroom with a group of learners, stimulating engaging discussions related to the case facilitated by a trainer.ViC has been well received, both by individual users and the key institutions and family planning experts in the target countries/territories.  It offers multiple advantages to Continuing Medical Education programs in comparison to the traditional methods of teaching, including: efficiency, standardization, easy accessibility, interactivity, decreased instructor workload, exposure to standardized cases of different levels of complexity, immediate feedback and links to the relevant resources, improvement of clinical skills in a non-threatening experimental environment, learner autonomy.  The fact that ViC courses are developed in partnership with key institutions in each country/territory encourages engagement and supports the ownership and sustainability of the project over the time.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Worldwide in 2017, 63 percent of women of reproductive age were using some form of contraception. In Rwanda, at the end of 2015, the contraceptive prevalence rate was 53 percent. In 2014, 20 percent among FP users in Rwanda were covered in community by CHWs trained in CBP-FP.These last play an important role in FP by generating demand, providing information and contraceptive methods (injectable, pills), and facilitating client referrals from community to health facilities.However,Rwanda’s CHW program is still noticing challenges in addressing unmet contraceptive need at the community level.To-date,CHW training and supervision has been largely focused on theoretical knowledge and reporting.While site visit at CHW household is conducted to supervise and ensure quality of FP service provision at community level, the supervision sessions were limited due to the nature of the work:individual home visit compared to the number of CHWs to visit and the available number of staff at HC which has been largely unfeasible to attain. To address these gaps, MoH in collaboration with the Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP),initiated in September 2016 the Community Health Mentorship Program in ten of Rwanda’s thirty districts.The program analysis presented here was conducted in four of the ten intervention districts</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The MoH in collaboration with MCSP,initiated a new approach to strengthen CHWs skills,knowledge,reinforce the link between health facilities and CHWs,and support the sustainability of provision of high-quality community based provision of FP.Once a quarter two mentors from HC(a nurse in charge of FP and incharge of CHWs) gathered 5 to 9 CHWs from 3 neighboring villages for a mentorship session.For each conducted in CHW’s home there is FP client scheduled in advance to receive FP service by visited CHW while mentors and other CHWs were observing.Based on identified gaps,mentors addressed them with consistent corrections through demonstration and discussions</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Prospective data analysis was conducted using data from four of the ten intervention districts (Rwamagana, Kamonyi, Huye and Nyaruguru), which include a total of 58 health centers. Data from these districts was selected purposefully as they started to implement community mentorship before the remaining 6 MCSP supported districts. A compilation of monthly quantitative data generated from SISCom (Health Management Information System for Rwanda’s community health program) and data from HMIS (Health Management Information System). The analysis included facility-based and CBP-FP indictors, looking at data from January 2016 to December 2017, and comparing the pre-intervention and intervention period. The analysis also included data reported every month by community health mentors who use standard checklists to track both theoretical and clinical skills, and also looked at the number of planned mentorship visits conducted, number of CHWs targeted and reached, and the documented strengths, challenges, and areas for improvement. The data reflects work with 4,597 CHWs and 116 community health mentors</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Before the intervention in September 2016 across all four districts there were a total of 162,019 FP users while after the intervention in December 2,017 FP users were 184,513 (new and continuing) meaning that there is an increase of 8,989 FP users from September 2016 to December 2017.At the end of the year 2017, a total of 67,064 FP users were receiving FP method at the community level, representing CHWs contributing 36% of FP service provision. Comparing new users on quarterly basis in 2016 against new users in 2017 across the four districts, we observed that new FP users in 2016 were 32,547 while in 2017 they were 42,774 which show an of 10,222 new FP users in one year. FP users who discontinued in 2016 were 13,529 while in 2017 they were only 11,214, a decrease of 21%. The contraceptive prevalence also increased by 4.7% in the four districts concerned. With regard to implementation of community health mentorship, 618 visits planned among them 608 mentorship visits representing 97 percent took place. Every quarter 98% of CHWs were reached by a team of community health mentors. A compilation of data recorded by mentors during mentorship session using a checklist of community health mentorship show that skills of CHWs and performance were improved in provision of injectable contraceptives from 64.1% (December 2016) to 85.7% in December 2017.Although, performance of CHWs is increased some of them are still challenged in providing clear information related to rumors attributed to FP methods</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Community health workers play an important role in overall FP service provision in Rwanda. Results from this community mentorship work show that the action to increase support to CHWs has overall positive outcomes, most notably the increase in FP users and a decrease in discontinuation rates. Early identification and recuperation of dropout clients played a key role in these results. Furthermore, high mentorship visit completion rates show that this model is feasible for implementation by public sector employees. The model of community health mentorship implemented by MoH in collaboration with MCSP as it is implemented facilitate CHWs to attend mentorship sessions. These positive results reinforce the importance of linkages between FP clinical services and CBP-FP providers. For the future, a cost effectiveness comparison between supervision and community health mentorship should be conducted. From these experience, the MoH with its partners in family planning program should extend this community health mentorship approach countrywide for continuous improved quality of family planning services at community level</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Building capacity of health care workers is crucial for achieving strong health systems and better health outcomes. Despite all the trainings that have happened in the health sector over the past decades, classic approaches to training and supervision have not resulted in the desired changes in quality of care and health outcomes. Classic training approaches focusing on off site, classroom based, theory heavy content have shown limited effectiveness in improving provider performance. Previously trained providers raised the issue of limited practice of skills either on models or lack of clients to practice ’hands-on’ during the course of these training. This is exaggerated by infrequent or no post training follow up resulting in lack of provider confidence and competence. Evidence (Rowe and Rowe et al 2009) identifies alternate training approaches to improve and sustain learning for better health delivery and care. It is against this background that the use of an alternate training approach was tested to see if it would enhance provider knowledge and skill and ultimately lead to increased uptake of Family Planning (FP) in Rwanda.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP), in collaboration with Ministry of Health (MoH), aimed to improve provider performance in FP through organizing On-Site Trainings (OSTs), post-training follow-up and supportive supervision by national level technical staff. The MoH, local health leaders, district health teams and heads of facilities were involved in planning and implementation to reinforce ownership. Proficient providers (nurses and midwives) were identified as district site trainers. Training materials for use by trainers and participants were developed and anatomic models were distributed at each OST facility. OST were scheduled according to the availability of participants at the facility.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The OST approach was implemented in 90 health facilities, including six hospitals and 84 Health centers in six MCSP supported districts in Rwanda from May 2016 to July 2017. Facility heads were contacted in advance for selection of learners and identification of a space within the facility to be used for trainings. In total 101 district site trainers were identified,  one trainer was assigned to a health center while two for the hospitals. .A total of 736 learners including doctors, nurses and midwives working in the identified health facilities underwent trainings using the OST approach. The course content was delivered in an interactive manner at appropriate times over the course of 8 weeks with a maximum of 3 hours per day and three sessions per week. The clinical focus was on FP counselling, skills practice on models and clients and feedback from district trainers. The HMIS report and program documentation were used as data sources for tracking results of  the intervention. Findings from the intervention, including uptake of FP methods, was shared with health decision makers at different levels of the system. Clients receiving FP services, health providers and the Rwandan health systems are the intended beneficiaries of this intervention</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>An initial performance assessment conducted in the 90 health facilities of the six districts prior to the intervention revealed only 1.4% of all health providers identified for OST were currently providing family planning services with acceptable performance( 80% in theory and 85% in practice). During the 14 months of the intervention (May 2016-July 2017), this number increased from 12 to 736 of identified providers. This increased the availability of trained staff for providing FP services from 1.4% to 6,033% in the six intervention districts from program data.</p><p>Apart from increase in the number of trained staff for FP services, the HMIS data shows increasing trends in new acceptors for FP, with new acceptors increasing from 9,129 in December 2015 to 20,486 in December 2017 representing an increase of 124%. Program data also showed a rise in the acceptance of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives, with uptake of implants among new FP, acceptors increasing from 1,238 in December 2015 to 8,363 in December 2017, this represent 575% of increasing, and uptake of IUD increased from 61 in December 2015 to 386 new acceptors in December 2017, this represent 553% of increasing from HMIS.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Using an OST approach resulted in an increase in the number of competent providers in a short period. This human capacity development took place without disruption of routine services as it was conducted at the facility level at appropriate times so as not to interfere with service delivery. OST also helped providers learn within their workplace environment and address their specific workplace barriers like space, lack of equipment, or poor infection prevention practices. The increase in the number of competent FP providers at these sites further resulted in an overall increase in FP use, most notably in LARCs.</p><p>Moving away from classic training approaches to more effective training, like OST, is a promising practice for developing a cadre of competent health providers. The MoH, district and health facilities level authorities can implement this approach for better and sustained health outcomes. Ensuring a proper implementation plan, availability of commodities and an enabling environment is key for success of this training approach.</p><p>As challenges, during the implementation of OST approach we have faced unavailability at time of participants during evaluation, few reel client during evaluation period. A lot number of clients comes for others problem like illness, vaccination, ANC and others) during training period (the started with delay in the afternoon) and others trainings organized by others partners</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Currently in Rwanda, family planning (FP) services are provided at health centers, hospitals and health posts. Faith-based facilities that do not provide modern methods refer clients to nearby health posts that were purposefully equipped to provide FP services for them. Health centers provide a range of methods including long-acting revisable contraceptives (LARCs), short-acting and natural methods. Hospitals, in addition to these methods, also provide permanent methods (PMs). Although provision of FP services at each level is well defined, and despite ongoing training of service providers, healthcare workers still experience limitations in providing certain FP methods due to lack of basic knowledge and skills. New evidence(bluestone 2012) shows that traditional training approaches that use extended, off-site, group-based workshops have had limited effectiveness in improving and maintaining provider performance after training and identifies better ways to sustain improvements in service delivery. This evidence suggests that learning within the workplace, in short segments with frequent practice and a focus on doing, rather than knowing, is the most effective at impacting performance. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>USAID’s Maternal and Child survival Program (MCSP) utilized an onsite clinical mentoring approach to improve FP services. Clinical mentoring is a competency based capacity-building approach that allows for hands-on skills building of health providers in their work environment. It involves initial didactic trainings followed by on-site hands-on support to enable providers to improve skills and gain clinical competency. MCSP developed a pool of district mentors who were proficient in FP and willing to work in person and virtually with individuals or teams to build skills to ensure competent workplace performance and respectful provision of high-quality FP services</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>From January to December 2017, following identification and training of district mentors, the Rwandan Ministry of Health (MOH) and MCSP implemented a comprehensive FP mentorship approach in 172 facilities (12 hospitals and 160 health centers) in ten districts of Rwanda. Mentees were mentored in 12 FP competencies including FP counseling and provision of short- and long-acting methods.   , Mentors conducted visits to their assigned health facilities once a month to assess areas of improvement, set performance goals, and build relationships with their assigned mentees.. To ensure continuous practice, anatomic models were provided to each health facility. Clinical competency of mentees was assessed through client observation when possible, and via anatomic models when not, using standard mentoring checklists and including a thorough review of mentee records. Mentees were certified as competent after achieving a score of at least 85% in the skill as per the checklist. Mentees needing additional support were provided with ongoing mentorship. MCSP conducted regular supervisory visits to ensure smooth running of mentorship activities and address any gaps. Program data from service statistics in the intervention facilities was used. Clients receiving FP services, health providers and the health system are the intended beneficiaries of this intervention.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p></p><p>Over one year period, 366 health providers from 172 facilities in the 10 MCSP supported districts were mentored in FP through this approach. There was an observed increase in provider competency during the intervention period with 100% of health providers mentored scoring competent in FP counseling and 60% scoring competent for provision of short-acting methods. For LARCs, 48% of providers scored competent for provision of implants, 17% for Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) and 11% for postpartum IUDs. All 12 hospitals and 160 health centers were found to be providing quality FP services and improved documentation in client files and facility registers was observed. All health facilities made remarkable efforts to improve their working environments and 143 of the 172 facilities moved their FP services to better rooms and equipped them with essential equipment and supplies. 84% (145) of facilities integrated their FP services into other departments such as maternity, HIV, Immunization and antenatal care. There was an increase in new users of FP methods from 17,942 in October to December 2016 to 33, 674 in October to December 2017 (87.7% increase) as well as those opting for LARCs or PMs. New users of LARCs and PMs  increased from 3,138 in October to December  2016 to 14,779 in October to December 2017 (371% increase); while short acting methods increased from 14,804 to 18,895 (28% increase) during the same period. This in turn increased the number of clients using family planning from 384,805 to 455,926 (18% increase) during the intervention period.   </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Findings show not only a double-digit increase in uptake of FP methods, but a substantial increase in use of LARCs and PMs. Clinical mentorship contributed to these gains in FP by increasing the competency of service providers in both FP counseling and service provision. Unlike classic training that pulls providers away from their workstations, clinical mentorship focuses on building capacity of providers at their workplaces. Not only does this approach avoid the service delivery gaps that come up when providers are pulled from their posts, it also utilizes opportunities to serve clients while fostering learning in a providers work environment. Clinical mentoring is a practical and feasible approach that districts can continue to utilize to build ongoing capacity and competency of providers to yield sustainable and high quality results. Continuous learning, assessment and certification of learners is essential to improve and maintain use of clinical standards and ensure continuity of quality and access to family planning services at all times.Use of social media like WhatsApp was an enabling factor in exchange of learning experiences.</p><p>Moving forward and to ensure scalability and sustainability of the mentorship approach, ministries of health will need to revise roles of identified providers/mentors to build in mentorship as one of their tasks. Implementation of an effective clinical mentoring approach calls for commitment from all levels of stakeholders including program managers, hospital managers, mentors, mentees both at central and district level.</p>",

      "title": "Why does knowledge of key injectable contraceptive characteristics decrease three months after training? Results from an implementation research study using panel data",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Unmet need for family planning (FP) in Nigeria remains high despite efforts to expand access to FP over the past two decades. Patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) are the most popular service delivery point for contraceptives with 38% of modern contraceptive users and 13% of all injectable users obtaining their method from a PPMV (NPC, 2014). Despite this demand, Nigerian law restricts PPMVs from selling and administering injectable contraceptives because they lack formal training (NPC, 2008 &amp; 2003). With the 2009 World Health Organization endorsement of community health worker provision of injectable contraceptives, Nigerian policy-makers are debating whether task-shifting injectable contraceptive provision to PPMVs can increase access to and use of contraceptives.</p><p>Legally there is no educational or training requirement to be registered as a PPMV, but PPMVs are generally expected to have completed primary school (Liu, 2015). As the Federal Ministry of Health decides whether PPMVs should offer injectable services, some argue that all PPMVs should provide injectable contraceptives regardless education attainment or prior training. Others suggest only PPMVs with certain educational or health facility experience should be allowed to provide injectable services (Liu, 2016).</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The purpose of this paper is to assess the trends in PPMV knowledge of injectable contraceptives and the determinants of PPMV knowledge comparing pre-test responses to post-test, and post-test response to three-month follow-up. Results will provide insights about what support PPMVs need to maintain adequate knowledge to safely provide injectable services and whether minimum qualifications are required for PPMVs to provide injectable services.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>An implementation research study was implemented among 189 PPMVs in Bauchi, Cross River, Ebonyi, and Kaduna states to assess feasibility and acceptability of PPMV provision of injectable contraceptive services. PPMVs participated in a five-day training on FP counselling for all methods, and counselling, referral and administration of injectables. Prior to the start of and immediately after the training, PPMVs were surveyed on their knowledge of injectable contraceptives. PPMVs were surveyed again three and nine months post training. To date, data collection and entry has been completed for pre-and-post training surveys, and the three-month follow-up survey.</p><p>The outcome variable is knowledge on all three key characteristics of DMPA-IM: (1) frequency of the injectable; 2) where the injectable is administered; and 3) the injection device. The outcome variable was coded as 1 for knowledge on all three questions and 0 for all other responses. The main predictor variable is <em>have administered an DMPA-IM in the past 30 days.</em> Several covariates were included in the model including sex, age, state, education and previous work experience in a health facility. PPMV data are longitudinal so random-effects logistic models were used.  </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Seventy-five percent of PPMVs were male, 59% had two or more years of post-secondary education, and 31% had worked in a health facility. Before the study training, 46% had provided injectable contraceptives and 59% had provided other types of injections in their shops. Fifty-eight percent of PPMVs had provided one or more DMPA-IM injections within the past 30 days at the time of the three-month survey.</p><p>PPMV knowledge on the key DMPA-IM characteristics increased from 13.2% at pre-training to 85.7% post, but then declined to 65.2% three months after the training. After adjusting for covariates, the random-effects logistic model showed that PPMVs were 73.3% (95% CI: 0.148-0.484) less likely to know the key DMPA-IM information three months after the training compared to post-test.</p><p>When limiting the model to 3-month follow-up data, PPMVs who had administered a DMPA-IM within the last 30 days were 1.9 (95% CI: 1.002-3.7678) times more likely to know DMPA-IM characteristics compared to those who had not. Having two or more years of post-secondary education, age, sex and state were not found to be significant predictors of DMPA-IM knowledge three months post-training.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Almost half of the PPMVs were providing injectable contraceptives prior to the intervention but their knowledge on key DMPA-IM information was low. This underscores the need for training if PPMVs are to safely and competently provide DMPA-IM. Knowledge increased after the training for most PPMVs. This suggests that this diverse group of service providers can learn from one standard curriculum.</p><p>Knowledge decreased from the training to month three for 20% of PPMVs. PPMVs who had administered DMPA-IM within the past 30 days were more likely to have knowledge of the method’s key information. This may be because those PPMVs are more regularly applying the knowledge gained after training. This suggests that PPMVs require sufficient demand for injectable services to maintain the knowledge necessary to provide those services. For locations where (or times of the year when) demand is low, PPMVs may benefit from peer-led practice, which could be organized through the local professional association.</p><p>The results also suggest that post-secondary education or previous health facility experience should not be made minimum qualifications for PPMVs to participate in task-shifting initiatives related to injectable contraceptive services. Especially since this would exclude 41-69% of PPMVs as potential access points. Additional models will be explored using nine-month survey data and for DMPA-SC and NET-IM.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>It is widely recognized today that ensuring a timely supply of quality contraceptives is essential for an effective reproductive health program. The tagline ‘No product, No program’ is known, understood and embraced by those working to support public health programs in the developing world.</p><p>India is committed to provide accessible, affordable, accountable and quality Family Planning (FP) services responsive to the reproductive needs of the client. FP commodities in India are centrally procured and supplied to all States/ Union Territories (UTs) by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India (GoI) covering 760 warehouses, 46,782 health facilities, 1,63,882 village level Sub-centers and through 8,82,947 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) at community level. FP programme in India has faced several challenges which include tracking of FP commodity supply chain, preventing break down of supplies for contraceptives and ensuring availability of accurate, timely and appropriate data for effective supply chain decision making[1]. The top down push system still prevails across the country, hence the personnel at various levels lack skills on demand forecasting, inventory management and distribution processes, leading to either overstocking or stock outs across many public health facilities.</p> <p>[1]Rapid Assessment Study, GOI, 2015</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In view of managing the aforementioned challenges, to strengthen supply chain management in public health system by real time tracking and monitoring of Family Planning commodities an application named ‘Family Planning Logistics Management Information System’ (FP-LMIS) was developed by MoHFW thus, ensuring commodity security and protecting client’s right.</p><p>This is a web based, mobile App based and mobile SMS based application which collects information on consumption, auto- forecasts demand and tracks distribution of FP commodities at the public health facility and up to community level through front line workers to assist program managers for appropriate and timely logistics decision making.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The formative/exploratory study aims at identifying steps involved in the development of FP-LMIS and critical factors in the institutionalization of the same on the field. The study will study various steps involved though  secondary research by  review of assessment report, policy documents on FP logistics, field testing findings, operational guidelines, training package, state program implementation plan . The sample state who have completed trainings at state level would be selected  from7 Mission Parivar Vikas States[1]identified by GoI. </p><p>[1]  Mission ParivarVikas are 7 high focus states with 145 districts having highest total fertility rates in the country\\</p><p>(UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan ,Assam  and Madhya Pradesh )</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>GoI followed a multipronged approach to strengthen the logistics supply chain through capacity building of key stakeholders on FP supply chain and inventory management, strengthening warehousing through regular field visits, development of a digitized management information system (FP-LMIS) through consultative meetings with Family Planning Officers from states and representatives from development partners and supporting swift of the application. The application was field tested with the users in real field setting in the state of Maharashtra and Odisha. Post field test, the feedback was incorporated to suit the need of the various stakeholders involved. Thereafter the application was launched by Union Health Minister, India on 11th July 2017.</p><p>Currently 100% of the States/UTs have trainers for FP-LMIS trained at national level. 59% of states, District level stores and 14% block level stores have been trained on FP-LMIS in the financial year, 2017-2018. 100% of the State/ UTs have updated their ground stock entry in State level warehouses and have raised their Annual demand for contraceptives for the FY 2018-19 through FP-LMIS.</p><p>In-depth review of various documets  revealed that development of comprehensive training package and structured operational guidelines along with repeated advocacy of national and state government played crucial role in operationalization of FP-LMIS. Additionally, customization of application as per state specific supply chain structure, mobile SMS alerts for key indicators, indenting through a mobile SMS are some of the unique features that were envisaged to play an integral role in FP supply chain management and system strengthening.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>For institutionalization of FP-LMIS, key factors like technical capacity, use of information for decision making, budget allocation and mid-course corrections is very crucial. The existence of these factors, in turn, depends on the degree of institutional ownership of the LMIS at both implementation and policy levels. The study indicates the critical factors responsible of institutional commitment for ensuring timely roll out and use of application to ensure availability of required contraceptives to the clients. Some of the key lessons learnt during implementation and roll out of FP-LMIS are:</p>\t<li>For smooth functioning of the LMIS, it is imperative to have user buying-in at all levels of the public health system.</li>\t<li>Standard operational guidelines and training package are valuable to standardize the learning process by end-user.</li>\t<li>Availability of Human Resources, infrastructure and budget allocation are crucial for successful implementation.</li>\t<li>FP-LMIS gives opportunity to each level of governance to assess live status of commodities up to community level and in turn make timely forecast, indent, inter- transfer or distribute the commodities from the levels of less utilization to the levels needing supplies to ensure commodity security.</li>\t<li>Auto-generated records of the commodity movement and availability can only be accomplished through Management information system.</li><p>Despite some operational challenges, FP-LMIS has been instrumental in ensuring Client’s Rights through improved availability and reduced stock-outs of all FP commodities necessary to provide the widest choice of possible methods available.</p>",

In addition, HZ staff decides the quantities to be supplied and arranges the transport with motorcycles. The HZ staff is assisted by an IPM focal point (IPM-FP), elected amongst members of the Health Zone Development Committee (CODESA).</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Two changes are made in the distribution of family planning commodities, HIV, malaria and TB medicines:</p><p>1.    The IPM-FP cooperates with the HF head nurse in stock-taking, timely reporting of stock and consumption data, and preparation of requisitions. Monthly reporting and requisitions are delivered timely by the IPM-FP to the HZ.</p><p>2.    The pilot HZ is divided into five transport routes, each consisting of three/four HFs located along the same route. Supplies for these HFs are consolidated into one transport. The IPM-FP manages transportation of products from the HZ pharmacy to the HF with two private transporters, contracted by the HZ.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The program interventions were implemented during a pilot in the HZ of Katana, South Kivu, Eastern province DRC. The 18 HFs and 2 hospitals included provide health care to a population of 241.000. All these points of service provide all family planning methods and related services and staff is trained on supply chain management through the C3[1] and Jeune S3[2] projects. The pilot with a total duration of 6 months is designed to be comparative, whereby the baseline data of November 2017 are compared with the interim results 3 months after the start of the intervention and the end-line results. For the purpose of this abstract we used the 3 months interim results and compared them to baseline figures. Stock and transportation cost data reported monthly and validated by the HF and the HZ are used for calculating indicators and analysing results. i+solutions provides technical and financial support for the pilot.   [1] The C3 project \"Commodities Chain and Care\" under the lead of UNFPA and funded by the Government of the Netherlands [2] Jeune S3 is an alliance under the leadership of Cordaid and a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The impact of the change in transportation from a pull model to an informed push delivery system was evident in terms of improved stock availability and reduced transportation costs. Transportation cost of family planning, HIV, TB and Malaria products dropped dramatically on average from $ 20 to $ 2 per HF per month. The change from a pick up system to an informed push delivery system from the HZ to the HFs, allows for optimal route planning, combining supplies of three to four HF into one trip and consolidation of supplies of FP commodities with other medicines.</p><p>The availability of products improved from 13 (out of 18) HFs that were out of stock for at least one product at the beginning of the pilot (72% of all HFs), to one single HF out of stock for one single contraceptive (Microlut) 3 months after the start of the pilot. This product was also out of stock at the level of the HZ.</p><p>Also, in the pilot, a reduction in total number of days out of stock for all contraceptives from 2.143 days in November 2017 to just 5 days in February 2018 was also reported.</p><p>There was also broader involvement of the community in managing the supply chain through IPM-focal points.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The results obtained since the implementation of the IPM approach in Katana show a very positive trend both in reduction of cost of transportation and in the stock outs incidences. By organizing transport of products from the HZ to HFs, through route optimisation and consolidation of supplies of FP commodities with other medicines, substantial financial savings were delivered at the level of the HFs. In addition, no time is spent at HFs on picking up product at the HZ pharmacy, which allows staff to spend more time on providing services to clients.</p><p>The appointment of the IPM focal persons plays a supporting role in improving quality of data, timely data exchange between the HF and HZ and facilitating physical transportation from the HZ pharmacy to the HFs, dramatically improving availability of all contraceptive at the HF level. Equally, involvement in last mile distribution of HZ staff and the community increased significantly. To further expand the impact of the approach and to make it more sustainable, the following is recommended:</p><p>1.       Add automation of the Logistics Information and Management System in order to enhance the quality of data and their real-time availability.</p><p>2.       Upscale to include other health zones.</p><p>3.       Include all drugs used at the HF in the e-IPM approach.</p><p>4.       Funding provided through the project needs to be replaced by a sustainable financial model. Alternatives are under exploration.</p>",

      "title": "Placing people, data and processes at the heart of supply chains improvement through IMPACT Teams in Guinea, Kenya, Myanmar and Indonesia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>At the heart of the best functioning supply chains are incredible people. In addition to the many approaches to strengthen data systems, transport, and other physical attributes of managing and monitoring supply chains, it is critical to consider how to connect people and empower and motivate them with data to improve supply chain performance, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The IMPACT Team approach adapts a quality improvement method for supply chain management to achieve just that. IMPACT Teams are deliberately made up of people across functions and disciplines who are trained to interpret key process and outcome indicators, follow a problem-solving process, and are empowered to use their data to make operational and strategic decisions that continually improve the performance of their supply chain.</p><p>The results from early implementations are impressive – implementation research from Malawi shows that significantly improving data visibility is not enough; supply chain outcomes were significantly improved in areas where the information system was combined with a data use culture, and staff could analyse, use or transform data for decisionmaking and action (Shieshia, 2014). Compelled by this success, between 2015-2017, Kenya, Myanmar, Guinea and Indonesia launched IMPACT Teams for their family planning supply chains.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The broad success of these interventions encouraged a cross-country retrospective analysis of the IMPACT Team approach, how effective it is in improving supply chain performance, and the enabling conditions for success. The cross-country analysis asks two research questions: Are IMPACT Teams effective in improving supply chain outcomes, including performance, data quality, and efficiency and is there variability in their effectiveness (e.g., for some activities, or for some levels of the supply chain)? And, what are the enabling factors required for IMPACT Teams to be effective in improving supply chain performance?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A retrospective analysis of IMPACT Team implementation for family planning supply chains is underway in four countries (Kenya, Guinea, Myanmar, and Indonesia). We have developed an IMPACT Team theory of change to guide the analysis and selected a series of qualitative and quantitative indicators that are applicable across implementations. Data sources include IMPACT Team documentation (e.g., action logs), routine information sources (e.g., DHIS2), qualitative interviews, and focus groups.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary results from Kenya, Guinea, Myanmar, and Indonesia have shown that IMPACT Teams significantly or notably improved supply chain performance. For example, in Kenya, IMPACT Teams narrowed the gap between overall and timely reporting rates for contraceptives and vaccines. One county that prioritized quality data saw a 29-44% reduction in data discrepancies. Another county reduced and maintained a 0% stockout rate of contraceptive tracer commodities for the three consecutive months.</p><p>This evaluation will look at data across the four country implementations to provide insights into how effective IMPACT Teams for different levels or activities within the supply chain, and what the enabling factors are for success.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Some data are already available that show how IMPACT Teams improve performance, including reducing stockouts and improving supply reliability and reporting. This study, however, seeks to add to the field of supply chain management, and specifically data for management, by dissecting the data to understand the key drivers of this approach. This can guide data for decision making efforts in supply chains across low and middle income countries to ensure family planning products reach women when and where they need them.</p>",

      "title": "Integrating long acting reversible contraceptives within youth friendly services to adolescent and youth in Ethiopia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>One-third of Ethiopia’s population is aged 10-24 years. The total fertility rate has declined from 5.5 to 4.6 children per woman between 2000 and 2016, per the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). However, at 13% teenage pregnancy continues to be the challenge. Adolescents and youth have limited access to the full range of contraceptives including long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs).  Unmet need for contraception is high: 30% among 15-19 and 20% among 20-24-year old women. The most common methods in both age groups are short-acting methods, injectables being the most used.  Attention to this sub-group regarding their reproductive health and contraceptive choices will positively impact Ethiopia’s population health, well-being, and future economic growth.</p><p>The Integrated Family Health Program (IFHP+) with the Evidence to Action project conducted a study in 2014-2015 to test a service delivery model offering contraceptive services including LARCs to young people in 10 Youth Friendly Service (YFS) units in Amhara and Tigray regions. The results showed that training YFS providers to offer quality counselling and all contraceptive methods in one location resulted in higher LARCs uptake for all sexually active young women, including those planning on delaying their first pregnancy and spacing second pregnancy.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The global consensus statement on expanding method choice for youth calls for the provision of evidence-based information on the safety, effectiveness, reversibility, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and benefits of contraceptive options. Based on this, the USAID Transform: Primary Health Care project in 2018 continued after IFHP+ to integrate LARC services within YFS. YFS providers were capacitated to improve LARC uptake by the enhancement of their counseling and clinical skills on implants and intra-uterine devices. In addition, orientation of peer educators on YFS was conducted to create demand and strengthen referrals.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The scale-up of LARC integration started in July 2015 and continued to June 2016. Providers were trained for two-weeks using theoretical and practical sessions. Pre-tests and post-tests were administered, and each participant was evaluated, closely followed, and expected to perform at least 5 implants and intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) insertions during practical sessions.</p><p>Peer educators were oriented on LARC counseling, information dissemination, and referral protocols to create demand and improve referrals. Close technical support was provided by project staff to cover any inadequacies and technical challenges in service delivery.  Since the start of the scale-up, 184 YFS facilities included LARC service as part of their services provision.  368 health care providers were trained on LARCs. This training improved providers’ skills in counseling, implant and IUCD insertions, and reduced provider bias against providing LARCs to young people. The YFS providers, peer educators, and the health facility heads conducted quarterly review meetings to monitor the quality of the services, check peer educator’s performances, and further strengthen the demand creation and referrals by peer educators. The service data was captured in YFS sites and reported on quarterly basis. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The LARC integration within the YFS scale-up started in April 2015 and continued until June 2016. During this period 187,590 clients accepted modern contraceptives. Of these clients, 18.5% (34,757) received LARCs of which 79.2% was Implanon; 11.9% Jadelle; while 8.9% received IUCD. Among adolescent and youth clients who were on short acting contraceptives, 64.3% received injectables while the rest used oral pills and emergency contraceptives. According to the EDHS 2016, the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) among the 15-19 and 20-24-year age groups has improved significantly in the 2000-2016 period (by 32% among 15-19 year-olds and 38% among 20-24 year-olds); with a sharp increase in LARCs during the same time period (by 6% among 15-19-year-olds and 10% among 20-24-year-olds).  However, the most common methods in both age groups continues to be short-acting methods (injectables are the most common method). Adolescents and youth accept LARCs at a higher rate in the project’s intervention areas than the average LARC uptake rate across Ethiopia among the same population. There was a rapid increase in uptake during the first two quarters, which then leveled off. We believe this is partly due to the challenge of high turnover of trained YFS providers and peer educator attrition affecting service provision and demand creation at the community level.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>As described, health care providers were focusing only on the provision of short acting contraceptives. Therefore, training of providers on LARCs and integrating LARCs services within YFS improved providers’ attitude in LARC provision. Additionally, providing orientation to peer educators and sensitizing the community reduced community bias that denies young people opportunities to access LARCs.</p><p>Giving young women access to effective contraceptive methods can help alleviate poverty by honoring their right to decide when and how many children they want to have and to plan for a family size that they and their partners can support. Young women will be able to seek better educational and employment opportunities, leading to poverty reduction and ensuring prosperity for all.  </p><p>For Ethiopia to reduce fertility, improve CPR, and reduce child and maternal mortality, it’s imperative that the country provide access to the full range of contraceptives and method choice for all, especially for sexually active adolescents and youth.  Creating access to LARCs and increasing young people’s knowledge on LARCs services will result in a steady increase in LARC utilization and ultimately reduce teenage pregnancy.</p>",

      "title": "Making the case for expanded method mix among adolescents: lessons from a multi-country analysis of Marie Stopes International's routine data from rural mobile outreach services",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Marie Stopes International (MSI) launched their Global Adolescent Strategy in 2017 to increase adolescent access to sexual and reproductive services across our global partnership of 37 countries.</p><p>Adolescents face a multitude of barriers in accessing contraceptive services, including provider bias, location and discretion of services, pricing, and, perhaps most importantly, stigma. We therefore strive to ensure all our existing service delivery channels (including static clinics, mobile outreach, community-based nurses, and social franchise clinics) are affordable and accessible and that our young clients have a positive experience with MSI.</p><p>MSI’s mobile outreach teams travel to mostly rural locations and operate either out of a public health facility, another suitable building, or tents. Where possible, outreach teams provide a range of contraceptive methods including short- and long-term reversible methods, as well as permanent methods where feasible, for free or at a greatly reduced cost.</p><p>With mobile outreach, significant barriers to care such as cost and distance are reduced or removed. In addition, all our providers are trained to offer client-centred care, regardless of the clients’ age, marital status, or childbearing status. Community-based mobilisers often work with communities before the outreach visit to address myths and misconceptions and try and overcome stigma towards contraception.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In 2016, we undertook a situational analysis of MSI’s adolescent client reach and demographics across six sub-Saharan countries to understand our adolescent (15-19) clients across different country contexts. Using routine outreach data from Ghana, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia, we aimed to answer the following research questions:</p><p>(1) What is the age profile of MSI’s of mobile outreach clients?</p><p>(2) What contraceptive methods or services do adolescent mobile outreach clients take up?</p><p>(3) Does method mix vary by age and parity among adolescents on mobile outreach?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>MSI conducted a descriptive analysis of MSI’s routine Client Information Centre (CLIC) routine client data for the six countries’ outreach teams from April to September 2016. </p><p>Data were collected on laptops during mobile outreach visits. Initial demographic and identifier data was collected in the offline CLIC portal by the team driver at the start of the client visit. Once the client had seen a provider, the provider’s written notes were then entered into the CLIC client record by the driver after the client visit. Once the laptop regained connectivity the client data was then stored, encrypted, in a secure central data warehouse where fully anonymised datasets could be run for analysis. Data from all client visits at any outreach site in any of the six countries during this time frame were recorded and analysed.</p><p>Fully anonymised datasets from each country were appended, local values grouped for comparison, and data cleaned of errors. Visits included in the analysis were those among contraceptive clients (including visits where a method was not taken up, but a family planning service such as counselling was received). Adolescents were defined as being 15-19, and adults were defined as being 20-49. Analysis was conducted in STATA-14.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During the six-month analysis period, outreach teams across the six countries saw a range of proportions of their clients aged 15-19 (4% in Kenya, 10% in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, 14% in Ghana, and 38% in Sierra Leone). Five of the countries reached proportionately more adolescents who had already begun childbearing than nulliparous clients  in this channel (71% in Ghana, 95% Kenya, 89% Tanzania, 63% Uganda and 93% Zimbabwe). The exception was Sierra Leone, where only 27% of adolescent clients were parous, and 72% were nulliparous.</p><p>Contraceptive method mix was similar among adolescents and adults. The proportion of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) use among adolescents across the six countries ranged from 40% in Sierra Leone to 97% in Ghana; compared to 33% in Sierra Leone to 91% in Ghana among adults. This was dominated mostly by implants, which constituted a higher proportion of method mix among adolescents in all six countries than implant use by adults. The proportion of implant use by adolescents ranged from 23% in Sierra Leone to 95% in Ghana, compared to 17% in Sierra Leone and 85% in Ghana among adults.</p><p>The proportion of LARC use was no more than 7% different between parous and nulliparous adolescents everywhere, except in Tanzania and Uganda where parous adolescents were 61% and 42% more likely to receive LARC than nulliparous clients respectively.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our analysis demonstrates that mobile outreach can be used to reach adolescents with a broad method mix, including both the parous and nulliparous groups - despite the latter being traditionally considered ‘hard to reach’ in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Where Sierra Leone focused heavily on a school-linked outreach model, they saw a much higher proportion of adolescents than in other countries where teams focused on community-based outreach sites. Sierra Leone also reached more nulliparous adolescent clients, as pregnant girls and young mothers are often barred from attending school in the country.</p><p>Our analysis also demonstrates that, where cost and access barriers are removed or reduced, adolescents choose LARC, particularly implants, at an equivalent or higher rate than adults. Where an external factor affected method mix (for example a stock out of implants during the analysis period in Sierra Leone, or restrictions on providing short-term methods during outreach visits due to widespread availability of these methods in the public sector in Ghana and Kenya), it appeared to affect method mix in both age groups equally.</p><p>Additional effort is required to work with providers in some settings however, notably in Tanzania and Uganda, where values-clarification and attitude transformation training could help address provider bias or outdated knowledge about the suitability of LARC for nulliparous women.</p><p>These findings are important for supporting efforts to expand access to a full range of contraceptive methods for adolescents, including pre-childbearing youth who may be equally (or more) motivated to prevent unwanted pregnancy than women seeking contraception to space births. </p>",

      "title": "Preferred Contraceptive Attributes among Women Who Aspire for a Family in Côte d’Ivoire ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Sexually active women who are interested in marriage, but not necessarily in a stable relationship, have a need for nuanced control when it comes to contraception. Unwanted pregnancy during this phase has the potential to lead to other consequences, such as unsafe abortion, and economic precarity. Women in this life stage—called Family Aspirationals—were identified during a nationwide analysis of demand for family planning, conducted by Camber Collective under the USAID-funded and PSI-led Transform-PHARE project.</p><p>We believe this group resembles a growing group of young women across the Sahel, and globally. Family Aspirational women face conflicting pressure, to conform to both modern and traditional gender norms, and are in a particularly vulnerable life stage, as a pregnancy outside of a stable relationship may not be recognized by the woman’s partner. Due to this vulnerability, Family Aspirational women often do not use modern contraceptive methods and may resort to unsafe or ineffective practices.</p><p>Funded with a Grand Challenge grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, this project seeks to generate evidence that will improve the understanding of Family Aspirational women’s contraceptive needs, preferences, and behaviors—to inform the development of new contraceptives to serve women in this life stage.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The project’s key hypothesis is that Family Aspirational women need a contraceptive method with attributes which are not currently available in market. These women need the ability to exercise nuanced control over their own fertility, via a method that can be used during some – but not all – sexual encounters, and which can fit into complex daily routines. Desired attributes could also include rapid reversibility, discreet use, and easy access at convenience stores. Research probed into the economic and social lives of Family Aspirational women, and the implied impact on their ability to access and use contraceptive methods.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study employed mixed method research, including an adapted conjoint exercise and human centered design with twenty (20) female participants (“participants”) in the Family Aspirational life stage between the ages of 18-30, who reside in Abidjan and its peri-urban areas, and have a range of differences in parity, relationship status, religion, education level, and social economic status.</p><p>Participants engaged in four key data collection activities including: 1) an introductory interview 2) a two-week daily journaling exercise, 3) an in-depth follow-up interview – including a conjoint exercise and human-centered design activities, and 4) a focus group to iterate on ideal methods of contraception that were co-created by the participants themselves. All interviews and exercises were recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p><p>In-depth qualitative analysis probed into the social and economic contexts of participants, as well as their behavior and preferences around fertility regulations and contraceptive use. Analysis also identified trends across the 20 participants in terms of contraceptive use and barriers. The conjoint exercise enabled the process of co-creation as it gave interviewees concrete building blocks with which to formulate their ideal methods.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Initial analysis reveals Family Aspirational women have specific needs and desires regarding contraceptives, informed by their current understanding of available methods, their relationship status, and their desire to have children.</p><p>Participants demonstrated a need for methods not currently available, including a method with no side effects (or side effects perceived as positive), and one that they consider to be less invasive – something swallowed, injected, or applied rather than a device that is inserted in any fashion. Participants expressed an interest in a method that would also protect them from HIV and STIs. They also discussed the packaging, marketing and price points that would be most appealing. Further details about the specific attributes and contraceptive methods designed by participants will be shared at the presentation.</p><p>Additional insights emerged from the research process. Participants shared stories with researchers about using alternative methods for pregnancy prevention – such as drinking lemon juice or coke mixed with tomato juice. Seeking to improve their understanding of the range of available and effective methods, participants were quite inquisitive, indicating a desire for more, and more accurate, information.</p><p>Participants also became deeply engaged and proud to be part of the research process. They showed strong motivation and enthusiasm over the course of the multiple data collection points, which is noteworthy given how hesitant many women were upfront due to the sensitivity of the research. This finding suggests that there may be ways to increase women’s adoption of contraceptives through deeper user engagement in the design and delivery process.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>As urban centers in West Africa grow, and social norms and economic contexts change, it is likely that more and more women will experience a Family Aspirational life stage, across the Sahel – and globally – making it even more critical to understand their family planning behavior to meet their needs.</p><p>Pregnancy for Family Aspirational women happens during a time of social vulnerability and can have significant negative long-term consequences, yet this segment is typically under researched and not often served by conventional family planning programs and products. This research provides evidence on the type of nuanced control young women in this population segment hope to exercise over their own fertility, which may drive changes in contraceptive design, distribution, policy, marketing or products.</p><p>This research contributes concrete recommendations for evolutions in contraceptive technology and program design for Family Aspirational women in Côte d’Ivoire. Additionally, it generates insights on mixed method and human centered research design. Findings relating to methodology, such as use of novel research techniques, e.g., the daily diaries and the conjoint exercise, will be of interest to anyone working on human centered design and social and behavior change within the context of family planning. As this abstract represents initial findings, the presentation of this research will include a much greater reveal of insights and recommendations emerging from deeper analysis of a full range of the data.</p>",

      "title": "Understanding female adolescent and provider perspectives and practices related to self-administration of injectable contraception",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The introduction of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) in 2014 has opened the door to the possibility of self-injection of contraception. DMPA-SC is a three-month, progestin-only product packaged in a small, prefilled device designed for easy administration after minimal training. This makes it well suited for self-injection.</p><p>Self-injection may offer greater discretion and increase access to the injectable for those who face challenges obtaining clinic services. In particular, unmarried adolescents often encounter considerable stigma when seeking injectable contraceptives at various service-delivery points. Moreover, challenges returning to health workers for reinjection due to inconvenient clinic hours and financial constraints, among other factors, contribute to high rates of injectable discontinuation among adolescents.</p><p>Adolescent pregnancy remains persistently high in Uganda, with about a quarter of adolescents aged 15 to 19 years having initiated childbearing, despite a general increase in modern method contraceptive prevalence from 26% to 35%. Research has shown that young women can learn to self-inject just as well as older women, and that self-injection may increase injectable continuation for young women. Whether self-injection can help adolescents in Uganda to prevent pregnancy will depend partly upon the interest of adolescents themselves in self-injection, and upon providers who are currently gatekeepers to self-injection.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>There are two components to this presentation. The first shares results from a qualitative study to understand the extent to which providers and adolescents view self-injection as acceptable in Uganda. The specific objectives of the study were to assess adolescents’ interest in self-injection, and to understand family planning providers’ attitudes regarding self-injection for adolescents. The second component shares monitoring data based on actual self-injection by adolescents, made possible by the rollout of a small-scale self-injection program in Uganda in the year following the study. Together, these findings present a picture of attitudes and practices regarding adolescent self-injection.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The qualitative study was conducted in Gulu district of Northern Uganda in 2015. Adolescent participants were required to be sexually active within the past 12 months and either 18 or 19 years of age, or between 15 to 17 years and qualify as an emancipated minor. Health care personnel were recruited purposively from private, NGO, and public-sector clinics; public-sector community health workers; and pharmacies. To be eligible, health workers had to provide family planning as their main job duty, or, if pharmacy staff, sell injectable contraceptives.</p><p>Both adolescents and providers were introduced to DMPA-SC, the injection steps were demonstrated on a model, and participants were trained on how to give the injection. Participants then practiced giving the DMPA-SC injection on a model. Adolescent participants did not self-inject.</p><p>In-depth interviews were conducted following semi-structured interview guides. All interviews were audio-recorded, then translated and transcribed concurrently. Transcripts for adolescents and providers were analyzed separately using Atlas.ti to identify key themes and common perspectives of each group.</p><p>Monitoring data from clinics that offer self-injection training at the facility or through community outreach in Mubende district were recorded by providers in a registry in 2017 and 2018. Data were analyzed using STATA.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Forty-six adolescent women and 40 family planning providers participated in the qualitative study. The median age of adolescents was 17 years, and approximately half reported currently using contraception. Health care providers were evenly split among delivery channels, and nearly three quarters were female. </p><p>Three quarters of adolescents felt the injectable generally is an appropriate method for adolescents. Those who were not supportive primarily cited fear that the injectable can cause infertility. Among providers, just over half felt that injectable use by unmarried adolescents is acceptable. For the remaining providers, some expressed the same concern that the injectable (and other hormonal methods) may cause infertility, while others reported they recommend only condoms for unmarried adolescents.</p><p>About half the adolescents expressed interest in trying self-injection. Among adolescents who expressed reluctance, the most common reason offered was fear of the needle, with a few noting that self-injection would be difficult to keep private from parents. By a margin of about two to one, providers viewed self-injection <em>by adult women</em> favorably, citing the benefits of greater convenience and time savings, reduction in transport costs, and better adherence to the reinjection schedule. Regarding adolescents however, fewer than half saw self-injection as a good option, due to concerns about injectable use by nulliparous women or that adolescents lack the maturity to self-inject responsibly.</p><p>Monitoring data from 2017-18 will be presented, including the percent of self-injectors who are adolescents, where adolescents obtained services, proficiency of adolescent self-injectors, and the number of units given for independent self-injection.   </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Self-injection has the potential to increase use and access for this underserved population, and should be considered as one of a range of options offered to adolescents seeking contraceptive services.  However, adolescents’ misinformed concerns about fertility and the use of contraception—and the injectable specifically—may limit adoption of self-injection in this demographically important yet difficult to reach population. Concerns about method safety persist among providers as well. Making self-injection available to adolescent clients is likely to necessitate renewed efforts to overcome provider-imposed method restrictions and to ease concerns about the ability of adolescents to self-inject safely.</p><p>Following the qualitative study in 2015, as part of wider self-injection program rollout in Uganda, specific efforts were made in late 2017 to reach adolescents with the option of self-injection: for example, training public-sector providers on the importance of serving adolescents and working with providers who make periodic community outreach visits to bring contraceptive services closer to adolescents, as well as demand generation efforts that target adolescents.</p><p>Uganda is the first country in Africa to offer self-injection as a delivery option outside of a research setting. The findings regarding adolescent access to self-injection from data collected over the first year of the program in Mubende will be informative for Uganda and other countries interested in understanding the extent to which adolescents can access and take up self-injection—especially important given the documented benefits of self-injection for young women in terms of injectable continuation.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Kenyan population pyramid is wide based, with those below 25 years constituting about 66% of the population. 10.2% of the population is between the ages of 15 and 19 years, growing up with numerous reproductive health problems and rights violations including early pregnancy, HIV infections, sexual violence, unsafe abortion, and early marriage. Sexual activity starts early usually due to limited access to comprehensive sexuality information and changing family structure among other factors.</p><p>In addition, early child bearing remains a health and developmental challenge for Kenya where nearly 18% of women aged 15 to 19 years are mothers, with those from poor households and with the lowest levels of education being the majority. Contraceptive prevalence remains lowest among this target group at 10.1% with high level of unmet need for contraceptives (23%) among them. Comprehensive Sexuality Education can contribute towards addressing some of these problems as many young people are going without the requisite skills to  make informed choices.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Centre for the Study of Adolescence (CSA) has been implementing the \"World Starts with Me\" (WSWM) and Youth for Youth (Y4Y) program through the whole school approach. This means that the schools are the final implementers in the program and as such key players in the program, linking with all stakeholders involved such as teachers, parents, students, communities, health service providers, school administration and the Ministry of Education. The ownership of the program lies with the schools.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The five year program will be working with 90 schools in Nairobi, Bungoma and Kisumu. The program has currently worked with 30 schools in these regions in 2016 and 2017. The approach ensures that students are provided with comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), which should be intergrated within their annual school plans; ensures all school staff, parents, board of management members are sensitized about the program in school through the already existing structures e.g. annual general meetings; link schools to the nearest youth friendly centres for provision of Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) Services including FP; and stimulate a process of exchange among schools for linking and learning, as well as advocating for the program. Self assessments were conducted by the schools with representatives from the stakeholders listed above aimed at defining the needs of the school and the overall anticipated outcomes. The assessments assist the school to know the status of any SRHR education program in the school, which in turn brings enhanced understanding of the changes needed. Teachers and peer educators were trained to provide CSE and Sexual Repreoductive Health and Rights (SRHR) information, and health workers provided SRH services and health talks. CSA then conducted monitoring visits to check on implementation progress.</p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The self assessment workshops led to the formulation of school workplans with the stakeholders present defining roles that they will take up to ensure sustainability of the program in place. The school administration intergated WSWM and Y4Y witihn the normal school timetable; teachers were trained and facilitated sessions to students and other teachers to keep capacity up within the school; the schools put in place a referral system to ensure students can be linked to the nearest youth friendly centres and access SRHR services as well as have health education talks in schools by the health workers; parents were sensitized about the program and had discussions with their children on their SRHR needs, and a code of conduct was formulted to ensure that sstudents are protected from harrasment and there is a safe and healthy school environment.</p><p>Within 2 years, about 10,000 students have been reached with CSE and SRHR information and a total of 2,495 students accessed SRHR services within the health facilities. Health workers conducted at least 1 health education talk, including condom education, in each school</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>1. Involving all stakeholders within the school will ensure sustainable implementation of a comprehensive sexuality education program in schools and ensure all students have access to this information.</p><p>2. Ensuring schools strengthen their referral systems and linking them with the nearest youth friendly centres, will enable young people access SRHR services.</p><p>3. Ensuring that there are specialized personnel i.e. trained teachers and health workers to provide comprehensive SRHR information and services will enable young people access the correct information and are comfortable accessing services.</p>",

      "title": "Irrelevant, Dangerous, and at Odds with My Identity and Dreams: Qualitative research findings using human-centered  methodology in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania reveal emotional dynamics complicating contraceptive use among adolescent girls.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Each year in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls account for 2.2 million unintended pregnancies, and 25% of all unsafe abortions. Programs that effectively engage with women of reproductive age are not reaching adolescents—despite their acute need. Adolescent childbearing often means the end of girls’ education, limiting life prospects, and widening the gender gap. Despite growing evidence on what works and does not in adolescent programming, questions remain about how to intervene to translate meaningful youth engagement from theory to practice.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Adolescents 360 (A360) was designed to turn the traditional model of public health program design inside-out, placing youth at the center, and using the socioecolgical model of adolescence as an organizing principle. Given the affective nature of adolescent decision-making, A360 hypothesized that partnering with youth to develop and apply a deeply empathetic research approach fusing human-centered design (HCD) with public health, adolescent developmental science, and cultural anthropology would complement current evidence with actionable findings to reveal deeper understanding of the emotional and interpersonal dynamics influencing girls’ demand for and access to contraceptives,inspiring new opportunities to reach adolescents.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A360 conducted qualitative research in Ethiopia and Nigeria to empathetically understand the adolescent experience. In both countries, IRB-approved research protocols were developed from HCD activities, adapted to align with developmentally appropriate approaches for adolescents and anthropological research methodologies to minimize cultural bias. From September to December 2016, 294 and 217 semi-structured interviews were conducted in Ethiopia and Nigeria, respectively. In Ethiopia, respondents were identified in Addis Ababa, Afar, Oromia, and Tigray regions. In Nigeria, respondents were identified in Kaduna and Lagos states. Sites were selected to represent urban, rural, and religious and ethnic diversity. In both countries, respondents were selected through stakeholder analysis of the figures affecting and effected by adolescent sexual and reproductive health decision-making: adolescent girls and boys aged 15-19, mothers and fathers of adolescents, male partners to adolescent girls, community gatekeepers, community and facility-based health workers, and other service providers. Data collection and preliminary analysis occurred iteratively to ensure that thematic saturation was reached. Analysis was facilitated by professional designers working with adult-youth teams who jointly analyzed interviews, observational notes, and documents using an inductive thematic coding approach. Insights from Tanzania were derived from interviews conducted with youth and providers as part of human centered design capacity building exercises.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Across all three countries, young people crave help setting and achieving near term goals, financial independence, and reliable information about sex and their bodies. Six dominant themes emerged across the three geographies. 1) Financial and emotional anxiety in a changing world: Girls and their influencers feel anxious about achieving financial stability and a good life in transitioning economies that are competitive and cash-driven, leaving girls more exposed. 2) “I’m not sexually active unless I use contraceptives” \"I'm not sexually active, he's having sex with me\": For many unmarried girls, <em>sexual</em> <em>intent</em> is taboo. (“If I get pills my boyfriend will think I am enjoying sex”; “Getting contraceptives means I’m planning sex, which is a sin.”). In Ethiopia, youth researchers interpreted that “Being in a relationship,” translates to sexual activity, even when girls do not identify as “sexually active.” 3) “Motherhood is my dream! Infertility is more tragic than being a mother too soon”: Many girls perceive there is no competing ambition or joy that can be more reliably achieved than being a mother. 4) “You are offering me infertility”: Girls believe using contraceptives—long acting methods particularly—risks infertility. Counselling which emphasizes long-acting efficacy, minimizes bleeding changes, and does not reassuringly address return to fertility, confirms erroneous beliefs. 5) “I’m under seige”: Girls do not trust peers to deliver technical information (personal experiences are believed). In Tanzania and Nigeria, boyfriends are ´less trustworthy than thieves´.Girls feel unheard, unsafe, and unsupported. 6)“But I trust Mom”: Girls trust mothers to truly care, and crave moms’ explicit or implicit permission to use contraceptives, despite stigma. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>A360 findings from a transdisciplinary research and intervention design approach offer insights into adolescent girls’ SRH experience  across urban and rural contexts of Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania. Together, these findings represent opportunities to design SRH interventons with significant potential to ensure resonance and relevance as they are scaled. As a public health community, our attempts to offer AYSRH services often reflect a medicalized top-down narrative that presumes understanding of the adolescent experience, with approach that can be characterized as parental in tone: “When you become sexually active you should begin using family planning, to be healthy and finish school.” These interventions use sexual activity as an entry point, tout the functional health benefits of contraceptives for young people that do not resonate with youth’s immediate perceptions of need and priority, and therefore may be perceived as unreliable. This approach is fundamentally misaligned with adolescent developmental science and youth affective decision-making, which is focused on here-and-now emotional consequence and benefit, and colored by a developmental tolerance for risk and emerging ability to anticipate abstract long-term consequences. A360’s findings reinforce why we cannot continue to program around this narrative, and offers new directions to improve program design. Findings point to the importance of making contraceptives emotionally relevant, connected to immediate perceived needs, aligned with fertility and motherhood (where desired), permitted and supported by mothers, effortless, linked to security and stability, associated with a sense of personal value and importance, and divorced from any status of sexual activity. </p>",

      "title": "Resilience as the missing piece: Improving sexual and reproductive health among adolescents with the resilience-based Youth First program",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>‘Resilience,’ or the ability to bounce back and thrive after challenge or crisis, has become a buzzword in international development, especially in areas such as disaster management, climate change risk reduction, and more recently in fields such as family planning. Though the word ‘resilience’ may be in vogue, it is also a construct with a decades-long history of research and evidence-building in the fields of psychology and education. Research shows, for instance, that building resilience can amplify and accelerate improvements in adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH; e.g., Leventhal et al., 2016). However, despite the potential impact of integrating resilience-building within ASRH programs, this strategy has rarely been applied worldwide.</p><p>In this presentation, we describe Youth First, an innovative resilience-based ASRH intervention, that has been successfully delivered via government schoolteachers among over 50,000 middle school students in India and Kenya since 2009. Youth First is an evidence-based program that has been shown to improve outcomes such as self-efficacy, resilience, and self-advocacy, as well as ASRH outcomes such as ASRH knowledge and gender equality attitudes, beyond the improvements achieved by an ASRH program without a resilience component.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Youth First combines resilience training with adolescent health programming. It is administered via hour-long facilitated peer support sessions, conducted 1-2 times weekly during school hours. Schoolteachers are trained to facilitate sessions within groups of approximately 15 students each. </p><p>Youth First consists of a resilience curriculum (approximately 15 sessions), followed by a health curriculum (approximately 10 sessions). The resilience curriculum draws from fields such as positive psychology, emotional intelligence, and restorative practices, and includes topics such as character strengths, emotions, goal setting, assertive communication, and conflict resolution. The health curriculum includes topics such as hygiene, nutrition, changes during adolescence, and gender-based violence.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Youth First has been conducted among over 50,000 middle school youth (grades 6-8) in India since 2009. Youth First was also adapted to Kenya in 2017, where the program has reached approximately 250 youth to date. Participants have included rural and urban adolescents in India (in Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and rural adolescents in Kenya in agricultural and nomadic communities (in Tharaka Nithi and Kajiado).</p><p>Evaluations have included feasibility/acceptability trials, pre-/post-test uncontrolled trials, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and scale-up trials using implementation science. An external evaluation consisting of a longitudinal cluster-RCT and an additional quasi-experimental trial are currently in progress in Bihar, India to evaluate the long-term effects of the program and quantify dosage effects.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results indicate that Youth First is not only feasible and acceptable across a variety of settings but also may provide greater ASRH benefits than ASRH programs without a resilience component.</p><p>For example, students who participated in Youth First significantly improved health knowledge, gender equality attitudes, clean water behaviors, hand washing, menstrual hygiene, and communication with adults about health issues, vs. controls not receiving any curriculum. Students participating in Youth First also significantly improved health knowledge, gender equality attitudes, clean water behaviors, hand washing, health communication, ability to get to a doctor when needed, nutrition, and safety, vs. students participating in an adolescent health program without a resilience component. Results indicate that resilience provides a key missing piece in efforts to improve adolescent health, as combining resilience content with adolescent health content resulted in amplified improvements in health indicators, above and beyond an adolescent health curriculum that didn’t include a resilience component.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>In addition to trials regarding Youth First’s impact on adolescent health, a number of trials have also been conducted to ascertain how best to scale up Youth First. These tests have concentrated mainly on the state of Bihar, India, where in 2017 CorStone entered into an MOU with the government to prepare for scale-up of Youth First throughout Bihar government middle schools and residential Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidhyalaya (KGBV) schools for marginalized, at-risk girls. In all, there are over 19 million students in 70,000 schools (grades 1-8) throughout the state. </p><p>Scale-up trials indicate that the Youth First model is highly scalable via government schoolteachers. Additionally, trials have yielded a set of guidelines, implementation manuals and process requirements to guide scale-up efforts. Key findings could be extrapolated to benefit other similar programs as well, such as: the ideal length and pedagogy of such a curriculum; the importance of the startup phase in any school and the ideal roll-out phases across multiple grade levels; the centrality of supporting teacher interest and motivation; and the necessity of establishing flexible, scalable and data-driven systems to support teachers at differing skill levels.</p><p>Youth First has provided some of the first evidence in any low and middle income country setting that resilience is a key missing piece in improving adolescent health outcomes. Critically, this approach is not only feasible, acceptable, and effective, but is also highly scalable.</p>",

      "title": "Storytelling: An Innovative Approach to Address Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Related to Family Planning Among Youth and Those Working in Youth Programming",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Storytelling—which enables people to share and learn from one other—can be an especially powerful tool for communicating about sensitive or taboo topics, including adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH). As methods of communication have evolved, so, too, has storytelling. Initiatives like Humans of New York (HONY) demonstrate the power of an image accompanied by carefully chosen words to share experiential knowledge and inspire action. Although storytelling is known to have the potential to spread knowledge by leveraging a traditional means of communication, few studies have documented the influence of storytelling initiatives. The current study measured elements of storytelling on factors that affect knowledge regarding family planning through a two-phase assessment of the Family Planning Voices (FP Voices) initiative.</p><p>Family Planning Voices (FP Voices)—inspired by HONY—interviews individuals about their connection to family planning and accompanies their story with a high-quality portrait. FP Voices has interviewed and documented stories from hundreds of individuals around the world. It is a platform to share ASRH-related stories with a global audience and learn from others’ stories. This presentation will describe findings from a two-phase study on the effect of FP Voices.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This two-phase study explored the influence that FP Voices had on knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ASRH among storytellers and story readers. It also aimed to measure the effects of storytelling. In particular, this abstract explores the effect of FP Voices on youth storytellers. Understanding the ways to best to reach youth with essential family planning information is key to achieving the priority reproductive health goal of enabling countries to meet their family planning needs, specifically creating demand for family planning among youth.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The mixed methods assessment of FP Voices included online surveys and in-depth interviews and was conducted in two phases—Phase I in 2016 and Phase II in 2018. This abstract focuses on the qualitative findings from Phase I and II. Phase I included in-depth interviews (n=12) with storytellers, people who had shared their story with FP Voices, including youth (between the ages of 18 and 30) and youth-service providers. Given the prominence of the findings related to youth in the 2016 study, Phase II—currently underway—focuses on in-depth interviews and online surveys with youth storytellers, those working in ASRH and future ASRH service providers. Outcomes of interest for both phases included the influence of narratives on knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behaviors related to ASRH. Phase II is also exploring the ways in which sharing a story could affect future professional or personal aspirations among youth and how storytelling can affect the provision of ASRH services. The qualitative data was analyzed using Atlas.ti. This presentation will highlight qualitative findings related to youth and those working in youth programming for family planning from Phase I and II—which will have been completed for at least 5 months by the time of ICFP.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Findings from Phase I found that FP Voices positively affected youth storytellers’ knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy regarding family planning. Findings indicated the importance of FP Voices as a platform to discuss and address ASRH issues that are often taboo. One storyteller noted, “I have never seen a social media series that included voices of young people...That’s why I wanted to be a part [of FP Voices] and contribute my voice.” Storytellers also noted that being interviewed for the initiative prompted them to read other FP Voices stories, increasing their knowledge. One storyteller stated, “After being interviewed I found myself more open to reading other people's interviews and perspectives...It has also increased my knowledge because I get to read from other stakeholders all over the world.” Storytellers also shared that being interviewed positively affected their attitudes regarding their work in family planning. One storyteller noted, “It made me feel like my work was being recognized at the global scene. I felt like I can actually push for FP when it comes to young people accessing.” Several storytellers shared that having their story published by FP Voices strengthened their confidence by validating and elevating their experiences and several spoke of the impact that sharing their story had on their professional career. Storytellers also described the various reasons for wanting to share their story with FP Voices including one storyteller who shared, “I wanted the world to hear about the challenges of girls and women when it comes to accessing modern methods.”</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Study findings highlight the ability of stories and storytelling to positively affect knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and practices related to ASRH. Among key programmatic findings from our research is that stories can change views, opinions and beliefs around ASRH. In addition, when a young person shares their story it can build confidence and reinforce pride in and commitment to ASRH—a valuable contribution for young professionals. Finally, this research illustrates that both stories and storytelling can be used to support community-building efforts, strengthen a sense of community and promote community members to connect with one another. These findings will provide great value to informing future research on the effects of storytelling and to strengthen communication initiatives that aim to highlight issues related to family planning and reproductive health for youth. Phase II is still under way (to be finalized Summer 2018) and a more in-depth analysis comparing Phase I and Phase II findings related to ASRH will be available at the time of ICFP.</p>",

      "title": "A Characterization of Male Partners of Women Using Tier 1, 2, and 3 Effective Contraceptive Methods in Western Kenya",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Of the various barriers to family planning (FP) faced by women in Sub-Saharan Africa, a population with high HIV prevalence and unmet need for contraception, male partner resistance to FP (MRFP) is increasingly studied and cited as a potential barrier. Research exploring the characteristics of women's male partners can inform the development of FP interventions that focus on men. In some populations, historical masculine gender norms lead to MRFP, which has steered the field towards incorporation of gender norms into sexual and reproductive health (SRH) studies and interventions. We have recently launched a study in Kisumu County, western Kenya, to pilot a gender transformative intervention to shift masculine norms related to MRFP toward greater FP acceptance among men. In this study female-male dyads complete surveys that assesses beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors related to SRH and gender relations, then are exposed to a multi-faceted intervention, and ultimately will complete post-intervention surveys later this year. Although post-intervention data have not yet been collected, the baseline pre-intervention data provide a unique opportunity to describe the characteristics of male partners of women using different methods of contraception in western Kenya.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We sought to describe the SRH characteristics of men partnered with women who are using World Health Organization (WHO) Tier 1, 2, and 3 effective contraceptive methods in western Kenya. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We recruited 150 men and their female partners in Kisumu County. Participants completed surveys in June-August 2017, from which these data are reported. Dyads with women who desired pregnancy within the next 12 months were excluded from analysis. Using WHO criteria, contraceptive methods were classified as Tier 1 - subdermal implant, intrauterine device, vasectomy, tubal ligation; Tier 2 - hormonal injection, pill, patch or ring, and lactational amenorrhea; and Tier 3 - male or female condom, emergency contraception, abstinence, withdrawal, rhythm method, spermicide, diaphragm. A Contraception Awareness Score was calculated as the ratio of positive responses to \"have you heard of this method\" for 13 methods, divided by 13. A higher score indicates familiarity with more contraceptive methods. A FP Misconceptions Score was calculated as the ratio of correct responses to 9 statements that articulate common FP misconceptions (example: \"FP causes HIV\"), divided by 9. A lower score indicates endorsement of more FP misconceptions. Men also completed the Gender-Equitable Men (GEM) Scale to measure attitudes towards gender norms, in which higher scores indicate greater support for gender equitable norms. Intra-dyad FP concordance was calculated by comparing FP method reported by each woman and man that they and their partners were using.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Of the 150 women enrolled in the pilot study, 91% (136 of 150) wanted either no more children or another child at some time after the next 12 months. Ideally these women would be using some form of highly effective contraception, thus data only from these 136 dyads are reported here. Among 136 women, 27% were using Tier 1 methods, 43% were using Tier 2 methods, and 30% were using either Tier 3 methods or no contraception method at all. Among each Tier's subgroup (T1, T2, and T3), the following data for male partners is reported as T1, T2, T3. Mean age in years: 31.6, 32.1, 35.1. Percent with primary school as highest level of schooling: 68, 62, 58. Percent HIV positive: 14, 10, 17. Mean monthly household income in Kenyan Shillings: 15381, 20429, 20463. Mean length of relationship duration in years: 7.7, 9.1, 10.4. Percent in a polygamous relationship: 11, 7, 7. Mean number of sexual partners in the last year: 1.4, 1.3, 1.7. Mean number of children fathered: 3.1, 2.9, 3.4. Mean Contraception Awareness Score: 0.83, 0.86, 0.83. Mean FP Misconceptions Score: 0.57, 0.52, 0.48. Mean GEM Score: 59.9, 61.3, 59.9. Percent concordance on type of FP used within dyads: 51, 29, 27. In a multinomial regression analysis with Tier subgroup as outcome and age, schooling, household income, number of sexual partners, FP Misconceptions Score, GEM Score, and FP concordance as independent variables, none of these male characteristics were significantly associated with Tier subgroup.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Barriers to women's use of modern contraception are complex problems that touch on issues in ethics and justice, individual and population-level economic and social mobility, and relationship and gender dynamics. Our work seeks to be ecologically-grounded by incorporating an often overlooked component in SRH efforts: a woman's primary male partner. Through male engagement, and specifically by targeting those components of male gender norms that drive MRFP, we hope that we can contribute to decreasing the complex barrier of gender dynamics in women's use of FP. While our larger study seeks to shift those particular gender norms related to MRFP, the descriptive data presented here offer a snapshot of Kenyan men who are in relationships with women using highly effective versus less effective or no contraceptive methods. While we found no significant association between several male SRH characteristics and the effectiveness of contraception reported by their female partners, the different rates of FP concordance are surprising and suggest an interesting area of inquiry. If partnered men and women report the same FP method, this suggests there has been couple communication about FP, which has been associated with women's contraceptive use in the literature. Our findings underscore the complexity underlying women's contraceptive use and relationship dynamics related to FP. To ensure the success of FP interventions that seek to reduce women's unmet need for contraception, it is critical that research continue to focus on the role of male partners, who have been historically overlooked in SRH efforts.</p>",

      "title": "Educational Homogamy and Modern Contraceptive Use among Couples in Stable Union in Nigeria",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Educational homogamy is marriage between individuals who have attained similar level of education. Literature is consistent with the view that individuals form partnerships with individuals with comparable levels of education. In most situations, a reason why two partners with the same level of education form a partnership is that they tend to appreciate the same public goods or the same kind of leisure. E<em>ducational homogamy often</em> aids couple in their decision on daily activities but it is not known particularly in Nigeria whether it has influence on the couple’s use of modern contraceptive methods. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between educational homogamy and current use of modern contraceptive method among couples in Nigeria. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the population growth rate is rapid. The country has a total fertility rate of 5.5 and has been classified as one of the high fertility countries world-wide. Unfortunately, the level of modern contraceptive use (10%) known as effective method is strikingly low in Nigeria. This study provides information that are useful to assist family planning programmers on their quest on reasons for low use of modern contraceptive in Nigeria.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What is the modern contraceptive prevalence rate among couples in stable union in Nigeria? Is there variation in modern contraceptive use if the educational level of husband and wife is different? What is the difference in the contraceptive prevalence rate if couple have similar level of education? Can the relationship between educational homogamy and modern contraceptive use be sustained in the midst of some spousal demographic and socioeconomic characteristics?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A nationally representative sample of couples’ data obtained from 2013 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey was used for this study. The data collection method was cross-sectional and cluster design. A 3-stage sampling technique was used to select monogamous couples in stable union (married only once in their life-time) who are sexually active (have sex in the last 4 weeks prior the survey) and wife not pregnant but fecund (n=5722). The dependent variable was current use of contraceptive categorized as; not using any method, using traditional method, using modern method. The modern method was used as the main indicator in the multivariate analysis. The main independent variable was educational homogamy which was generated from the information on level of education of wife and that of the husband. Thus, four categories were obtained namely; both couple have at most primary education, wife has at most primary and husband has at least secondary education, wife has at least secondary and husband has at most primary, both have attained at least secondary level of education. Some socioeconomic and demographic factors were included as control in the regression model. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square model and multinomial logistic regression model (alpha=0.05). </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Mean age of wives and husbands was 29.1(SD=7.5) and 37.5(S.D=7.5) years respectively. About 50.8% of couples have the same level of education categorized as at most primary while 28.7% of the couples have at least secondary education. Approximately 15.7% of the couples were found in situation where wife has at most primary and husband has at least secondary while only 4.8% couples reported that the wife has at least secondary and husband at most primary. Modern contraceptive prevalence rate was among the couples was 13.6% and it was highest in families where both husband and wife have at least secondary education (28.3%) and least where they have at most primary education (4.4%) (p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study provides information on the relationship between educational homogamy and modern contraceptive use among couples in Nigeria. The study findings reiterate the fact that in spite of the marital stability, differences between partners may factor into the contraceptive decision-making process. A significant and consistent educational homogamy effect for couple was found regarding the use of modern contraceptive method. Modern contraceptive use was least among couples that are poorly educated and highest where couples have good education. It is interesting to know that modern contraceptive use was higher in families where wives are more educated than their husbands than vice versa. These findings call for further research on the pathways through which this association develops. Ensuring that individuals have at least secondary education before marriage will facilitate increase in the use of modern contraceptive in Nigeria. Trained health extension workers to sensitize families on the need to use modern contraceptives is essential to improvement of modern contraceptive utilization in Nigeria.</p>",

Dans le contexte traditionnel, les hommes ont une grande influence sur la santé reproductive de leurs femmes car ils sont presque les seuls décideurs sur les problèmes de santé de femmes.

Cette faible utilisation de la contraception est liée entre autre à une faible demande, qui résulte selon l’analyse situationnelle beaucoup de la faible implication de l’homme et du faible niveau d’instruction de la femme.   L’implication de l’homme semble limitée à la suite de l’insuffisance de sensibilisation sur les bienfaits de la PF et de certaines interprétations erronées de la population. Malgré les efforts fournis par le Programme National de la Santé de la Reproduction du Ministère de la Santé Publique de la République Démocratique du Congo et ses partenaires pour impliquer les hommes dans la santé de la reproduction, la participation des hommes dans la planification familiale est restée faible. Ce faible engagement des hommes demeure encore un grand défi pour le pays. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Cette étude a recherché les facteurs associés à la faible implication des hommes dans la planification familiale en milieu rural. Elle a visé à vérifier les hypothèses selon lesquelles la faible implication de l’homme dans la PF était liée (1) au faible niveau de connaissance des hommes sur la PF, (2) aux contraintes professionnelles des hommes ou de leurs épouses et (3) à la perception erronée sur les services de PF surtout la contraception moderne.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Une étude transversale analytique a été menée dans 5 aires de santé de la Zone de santé de Karisimbi, située dans la ville de Goma, au Nord-Kivu en RDC de novembre 2017 au mars 2018. Elle a porté sur les hommes âgés de 18 ans et plus et les femmes en âge de procréer, vivant en union avec un partenaire. Les participants ont été sélectionnés selon un échantillonnage à plusieurs degrés pour l’enquête des ménages et de manière raisonnée pour les focus groups et interviews. Les données en rapport avec l’implication de l’homme ont été collectées par interviews dirigées à l’aide d’un questionnaire dans les ménages, lors de deux discussions de groupes ayant regroupé de manière séparée les hommes et les femmes et par interviews semi-structurées des informateurs-clés dans chaque aire de santé. Les données ont été analysées sur Stata pour la partie quantitative et ont été résumées en proportion pour les variables catégorielles et en moyennes avec écart-type pour les variables quantitatives. L’association entre les variables a été testée en utilisant le chi-carré. Une régression logistique a été réalisée pour identifier les facteurs associés. Une analyse thématique a été réalisée pour les données de discussions de groupes et des</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Au total, 252 couples ont participé à l’enquête et 87 répondants aux discussions de groupe et interviews dont 46 hommes. En moyenne, les hommes étaient âgés de 37,7 ans et les femmes de 31,5 ans. La majorité avait au moins un enfant. La polygamie concernait 8,3% des hommes. Plus de la moitié des participants avaient un niveau d’instruction moyen et exerçaient des professions propres.</p><p>La majorité avait déjà entendu parler de la PF et plus de la moitié connaissaient au moins deux méthodes contraceptives. Près de deux tiers étaient favorables à la PF et 42 % estimaient que les hommes devraient utiliser une méthode contraceptive contre 52% qui les réservaient seulement aux femmes. Les raisons de non utilisation étaient surtout la peur des effets secondaires, le désir d’avoir plus d’enfants et les croyances religieuses. Plus de la moitié (62%) avaient déjà discuté de la PF avec leurs épouses et la moitié avaient associé leurs épouses à la prise de décision sur le nombre d’enfants à avoir. Seules 15% de femmes utilisaient les méthodes contraceptives. La proportion des hommes ayant montré une implication dans la PF était de 15,9%.</p><p>Les facteurs associés à l’implication des hommes étaient  l’âge de plus de 40 ans, le niveau élevé de connaissance de la PF, le fait d’avoir une profession avec salaire pour l’homme ou la femme, la participation de l’épouse dans la prise de décision sur le nombre d’enfants désirés, la discussion au sein du couple sur la PF  et le niveau d’étude moyen de l’homme.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Ces résultats suggèrent l’importance de mettre en place les interventions de sensibilisation de la communauté ciblant surtout les hommes  en plus de celles déjà mises en œuvre auprès de femmes. La sensibilisation des hommes ainsi les actions orientées vers eux sont plus susceptibles de favoriser l’acquisition de connaissance de la PF par ceux-ci, de favoriser la discussion au sein du couple sur la PF et la participation de la femme dans la prise de décision sur le nombre d’enfants désirés. Les interventions générales visant à augmenter le niveau d’instruction et d’éducation dans la population ainsi que celles qui visent l’autonomisation de femmes notamment par l’accès à l’emploi avec salaire sont également nécessaires pour potentialiser les interventions visant l’homme.</p>",

      "title": "Household Bargaining and other Relationship Differences between Contraceptives Users and Non-Users in Urban Ibadan, Nigeria. ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Across the globe, spurred by forces such as industrialization and urbanization, marriage patterns are undergoing shifts. In modern economies, families are rapidly ceasing to be units of economic production. This can lead to weakening of ties among extended family members and a strengthening of the conjugal bond (Cherlin, 2012). In addition, the growing importance of individualism and the rise in the status of women are spurring further change to the institution of marriage(Wilcox &amp; Nock, 2006. Burgess (1943) described these shifts as a transition from an “institutional” marriage based on traditional patriarchal authority, kinship and lineage systems to one based on “companionship.” Love, friendship and mutual respect are prominent aspects of companionship marriages. These marriages can be more egalitarian, with greater emphasis on communication and negotiation of mutual desires and goals between spouses, resulting in high quality marriages that are long lasting. Empirically the actual shifts in marriage patterns, in the west and across the globe, have been more complex than social theorists postulated. However, there is evidence to suggest that the ideation of the western family, with its emphasis on companionship and romantic love is spreading across the globe, even in settings with very little progress towards industrialization (Cherlin). </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>However, while marital patterns are changing across the globe, there is less clarity on the different types of relationships that are emerging because of these shifts, especially in terms of power dynamics and emotional processes, and how these changes in intimate relationships influence reproductive decision-making and contraceptive use. Given these gaps, in this study, we explored the similarities and differences in marital relationship of contraceptive users and non-users across multiple domains such as time use, household decision-making including long-term financial planning, relationship quality and reproductive decision-making as well as attachment to traditional norms.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The qualitative study was conducted in urban Ibadan, Nigeria, where we conducted repeated in-depth interviews with 21 young couples, where the woman was between 18-35 years old. Each couple was interviewed twice - separately as well as together as a couple. The goal of the first in-depth interview, where the couple was interviewed separately was to illicit detailed information on their relationship in terms of its power dynamics, gender egalitarianism, relationship quality and contraceptive use decision-making. The goal of the second interview, where the couple was interviewed together was to gain a better understanding of the couple’s attitudes and perceptions on the normative environment in their communities on marriage and relationships.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>While there were many similarities between couples who used contraceptives and those that did not, there were interesting differences between the two groups, especially when it came to how the couples made their decisions, their orientation towards planning and preparing for the future, the ability of the woman to negotiate and bargain, level of intimacy and relationship quality as well as their attachment to traditional social norms in a rapidly changing environment. In general, women and men in the contraceptive use group described a more systematic, planning-oriented and collaborative process of decision-making. The couples often formulated a household budget together, had an agreed upon prioritized list of items to spend on, and had a process in place to negotiate the best use of left-over funds, so as to maximize the best use of the family’s resources. In terms of relationship quality, while the contraceptive users displayed more elevated levels of communication and trust as compared to the non-users, there were particularly interesting differences in the importance they placed on sexual intimacy within their marriages. While the contraceptive users seemed very concerned about maintaining a certain level of sexual intimacy within marriage, there was a tendency among non-users to downplay the role of sexual intimacy within marriage. Finally, the contraceptive users demonstrated more tenacity and willingness to adapt to the changing economic realities in Nigeria, while the non-users were more attached to traditional roles and norms.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study provides critical and unique insight on how marriages processes and marital relationships of contraceptive users and non-users might be different, shedding light on key factors that enable couples to achieve their reproductive goals or alternately fail at achieving their goals. We get this insight from both the female partner, the male partner and the couple reporting jointly. While there is agreement on the need for family planning programs to engage couples, there is limited understanding on how to engage couples meaningfully without taking away woman’s choice and freedom. Our study findings suggest that relationships with an egalitarian orientation, with more collaborative and consensus driven decision-making as well as those with higher levels of relationship quality are more likely to succeed in achieving their reproductive goals.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning helps a couple to prevent unintended pregnancy. However, it is a long time, particularly in developing countries, prevention of unintended pregnancy has been considered as women’s responsibility. It is in the 1994 International Conference on Population Development, in Cairo, the concept of male involvement in RH programs was first declared. Male involvement is considered as an important intervention for improving maternal health, especially in countries where men are the key decision-makers and often determining women’s access to economic resources. This practice has implications for maternal health as it determines women’s use of family planning. Literatures have reported the benefits of fathers’ early engaging in maternal health care that include increased maternal access to care and increased likelihood of contraception usage. However, studies shows that it is rare to see men accompany women to ANC, PNC and be present for delivery in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, research evidences reported that women’s utilization of family planning services in these countries are very low.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We hypothesized that women whose husbands’ involved during maternal health are more likely to use postpartum family planning methods than their peer women who attend maternal health care alone. This study examined the relationship between husbands’ involvement in maternal health care and women’s use of postpartum family planning methods in Sideman Zone, Southern Ethiopia.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study was conducted in Sidama, one of the most populous zone of Southern Ethiopia. Its capital, Hawassa town, is found 270km from Addis Ababa (the capital of Ethiopia). The zone had about 2.9 million population; of which women (age 15-49) were 23%. Using a prospective cohort design, we followed a representative sample of 709 antenatal mothers until their postnatal periods, from June 01 to November 30, 2015. Data were collected using semi-structured interview questionnaire from June 01 to November 30, 2015. The main exposure variable was husband’s involvement in maternal health care (in at least one antenatal care visit or during childbirth) and the outcome variable was women’s use of postpartum family planning methods. Data were coded, entered, edited and analyzed using SPSS version20 software. A chi-squared test with a p-value &lt; 0.05, and bivariate and multivariate regression analyses with 95% confidence level were computed to look for the associations between the exposure and outcome variables. Before we reported the findings, multicollinearity tests, confounding, and effect modification for potential variables were checked. Further, the overall model assessment of the regression equation were checked using a likelihood ratio test, score test, and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The outputs of multivariate analyses show that husbands’ involvement in maternal health care was found to be a major predictor of women’s use of postpartum family planning methods. Women whose husbands’ involved in maternal health care were 11.3 times more likely to use postpartum family planning methods compared to their peers who attended the maternity care alone (AOR 11.3; 95% C.I., 4.5, 28).</p><p>Regarding women’s background characteristics, the effect-size of the associations between husbands’ involvement in maternal health care and women’s use of postpartum family planning were varies by place of residence, women’s age, education level, and by the number of U5 children alive during the study periods.</p><p>Comes to maternal characteristics, the number of ANC visited by women, initiation of antenatal care visit, use of skill birth attendants during recent pregnancy were not significantly associated with women’s use of postpartum family planning in the presence of husbands’ involvement in the model.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>There was a strong significance association between husbands’ involvement during maternal health care and women’s use of postpartum family planning service in this study. Therefore, interventions to increase husbands’ involvement in antenatal care and skilled deliver care should be considered to improve women’s utilization of postpartum family planning service.</p>",

      "title": "Increasing Male Participation in Family Planning in Uttar Pradesh, India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>FP2020 commitments in Uttar Pradesh (UP) are humongous and the result will impact the achievements worldwide as UP stands committed to contribute 10% of global commitment and 26% of India’s commitment. To achieve this UP needs to contribute over 12.4 million new family planning users. The National Family Health Survey-IV data reveals that mCPR in UP is 31.7% which includes 17.3% of female sterilization and only 0.1% of male sterilization under limiting method. Considering huge commitments under FP2020, male participation in FP is essentially required. Non Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV) has always been considered as a very effective FP method. It has a strong gender perspective as well that lowers the additional liability of women by way of encouraging men to take responsibility for FP. Despite rigorous efforts, number of NSV users is still too low and female sterilization is much preferred contraceptive method. Due to various associated myths and social causes, it’s always been a challenge in bringing out men for adopting this method.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>PSI through Expand Access and Quality to broaden method choice in UP focuses on FP demand generation and creating access to quality services through private providers in 32 districts of UP. Involving men for family planning discussion and empowering them to take right decision for their families was the assumption before start of the program. This project implemented specific male engagement strategies to promote male participation. Various marketing interventions are used for generating awareness, addressing myths and creating demand. 27 private providers have been trained and empanelled for providing NSV services. Quality Assurance is done by district quality assurance committee.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>From 2015 to till date male engagement strategies are implemented by PSI in 10 districts of project where trained male engagement team provides informed choice counselling to eligible men with focus on NSV. These clients are usually migrants, semiskilled workers belonging to low income strata. Demand aggregation was linked to quality service delivery at private facilities through FDS approach. Demand aggregation included:</p><p>A) Work place interventions: Men working in small industries and petty earners are made aware on FP merits.</p><p>B) Labor Chouraha Meetings conducted at crowded areas to remove the myths/misconceptions</p><p>C) Rickshaw puller Meetings: Team closely works with rickshaw pullers at their associations to counsel and connect them with private facilities.</p><p>D) Late evening meetings in slums: Men residing in slums are mostly available in late evenings so team conducts meetings and get opportunity to do couple counseling.</p><p>Project activity data is maintained by project MIS.</p><p></p><p>A web-portal has been developed by Government with help of PSI and other stake holders for single window private sector engagement which includes their facility accreditation, provider empanelment, service delivery and financial reimbursements by Govt. All these data are available on the web-portal with access to relevant stake holders including private providers.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>These approaches have helped to increase the numbers of NSVs, overcoming the myths and motivating others. There were no severe complications, morbidity or mortality reported. Male engagement strategy has shown significant results, the private sector contribution in male sterilisation was 31% in FY 2016-17 in the state which was only 1% in FY 2014-2015. 7.5% project cities of UP contributed 37% of state NSV. Strategy wise results are: (a) Out of total NSV clients “Workplace Intervention” has resulted in an overall 5.4%, (b) “Labour Churaha Meetings” has resulted in an overall 69%, (c) “Rickshaw Puller Meetings” has resulted in an overall 13.2%, and (d) “Slum Evening Meetings” has resulted in an overall 12.7% of contribution in NSV services acceptance.</p><p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Increase in male participation requires specific mobilization strategies. The learnings from EAQ project highlights that targeting male groups and addressing specific myths increases NSV coverage. Additionally acceptance of NSV services is high if informed choice counselling is provided. Male engagement strategies are cost effective and easy and can boost the male participation in family planning by acquiring large number of NSV clients. Few intervention strategies have been adopted by Govt. Involving men have can contribute to overall family planning acceptance as men are the key decision makers in family.</p><p>These strategies would be able to contribute for the family planning goals committed by the state Govt under its vision FP2020.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>It is a common belief that with rising women’s autonomy, the chances of limiting child birth increases. Women autonomy is deeply rooted in the cultural, traditional values and religious belief systems existing in the society and varies from one society to the other. The patrilineal system is a kinship system where the family membership of a person is trace through the blood line of a father and women after marriage in such system, move to the husband’s house permanently. On the other hand, matrilineal kinship system is a system by which the ancestral descent of a family member is recognized through the blood line of a mother and usually in this system, the husband move to the wife’s house after marriage. Both the family systems have different effects on women autonomy which is vital for child survival and development. The purpose of the study is to compare the variations in male involvement in family planning in the matrilineal society of Meghalaya, a state in Northeast India and the other major states of India which are predominantly patrilineal system. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Women in the matrilineal kinship are expected to have a better position in the family with comparatively equal decision-making power as the other male members of the family whereas this is not common in the case of patrilineal kinship system. Therefore, our study attempts to investigate whether there is a variation in male involvement pertaining to the acceptance of family planning among the matrilineal and patrilineal societies. The hypothesis of our study is that we assume there is no difference in the male involvement in acceptance of family planning among the two kinship systems</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study used the secondary data from District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-4) of 2012-13. The survey has been undertaken by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India in which International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) was apointed as the nodal agency to carry out the survey. The analysis were done by taking Meghalaya as a matrilineal case and other major states of India as the patrilineal group for eligible women between the age group 15-49 years. Descriptive statistics is used to examine the male participation towards family planning and multivariate analysis is used to understand the variations of male involvement by socio-economic and demographics. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The study found that usage of family planning is more among the couples in patrilineal system with 30% of them currently uses family planning method and only 12% of the couples in the matrilineal system. Male sterilization and husband’s motivation and facilitation towards family planning too is higher husband involvement in family planning is higher in the patrilineal kinship system as compared to the matrilineal system. The proportion of husbands opposing to go for family planning is more in the matrilineal society than that of their patrilineal counterpart. The study also found that education, rural-urban locations, age, income are some of the associated factors for family planning use and odds of usage of family planning in the patrilineal kinship is 3.28 times than that of matrilineal kinship system.  It is understood that males involvement in limiting family size is active in the society where they are more dominant rather than in the society where they are equally or less likely dominant.</p><p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Male participation in reducing family size is crucial and plays a key role in successful implementation of family planning programmes in India. Interventions for fertility control through family planning approach should be encouraged beyond individual women to target different stakeholders at different levels, including husbands and other family members especially in those sections of the society where partners/family members are still unaware of or indifferent towards family planning practices. </p>",

      "title": "‘I don’t decide alone’: Understanding Decision-Making Pathways to IUCD Uptake Among Married Men and Women in Nepal",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, such as the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD), are a cost-effective and reliable way of limiting child bearing and reducing unintended pregnancy. The national Demographic and Health Survey in Nepal (2016) showed that half of currently married Nepalese women and men ages 18–49 years do not want more children, and for many of them the IUCD could be a promising method to meet their contraceptive needs. Despite the proven safety, efficacy and reversibility of IUCDs (Kaneshiro and Aeby, 2010), the uptake of this contraceptive method is very low in Nepal (1.4%) (DHS, 2016) and neighbouring India (1.5%) (NFHS-4, 2015-16) and Bangladesh (0.6%) (DHS, 2014).</p><p>Sunaulo Parivar Nepal (SPN), an implementing partner of Marie Stopes International, is one of the leading service providers working to increase access to contraceptives and safe abortion services in Nepal. SPN has a dedicated team working with the government to distribute LARCs, in particular to areas that are hard to reach, and to poor or marginalized groups. In 2017 SPN provided 49,974 women with LARC methods. Most women chose a contraceptive implant; only 6,006 chose an IUCD. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>While men may play an important role in promoting or discouraging contraceptive use, very little research to date has examined men’s perspectives and concerns about IUCDs and their role in supporting women in the decision-making process for IUCD uptake. Thus, SPN decided to explore the decision-making pathways among men and women in Nepal that lead to IUCD uptake, including men’s knowledge, perceptions and attitudes toward IUCD usage and their involvement in supporting or discouraging women who are using, or considering using, IUCDs.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In February 2017 SPN conducted a qualitative formative study in five districts in Nepal that were selected based on lower-than-average uptake of IUCDs, as recorded by the Marie Stopes Centres in those districts. We interviewed 52 participants: 24 women who were current or previous users of IUCDs and 28 men whose wives were current or previous IUCD users; some of these men interviewed were the spouses of the women interviewed. Using a semi-structured in-depth interview guide, we asked study participants about the process that led to their decision to take up an IUCD and their experience with its use or, where relevant, their decision to discontinue using an IUCD at an early stage and their reasons for this. All interviews were recorded and transcribed in Nepali. Transcriptions were later translated into English. We analyzed the content thematically.</p><p>The Nepal Health Research Council provided ethical approval for the study. Prior to the interviews, all participants provided informed written consent to take part in the study and for the interviews to be recorded.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We identified an overarching theme of couples taking a ‘trial and error’ approach to finding the right contraceptive method. There was general hesitation to try an IUCD due to limited understanding and information among both husbands and wives, including myths and misconceptions, for example, that IUCDs can cause cancer and renal damage. In most cases women do not decide alone; the decision-making process involves consultation between husband and wives reaching out to friends and family for information before making a final decision. Both men and women explained that the decision-making process included starting with a contraceptive method they were familiar with, often trying 2–4 other methods before choosing to use an IUCD. Some of the women referred to their sense of discomfort during the pelvic examination for IUCD insertion. They also raised concerns about the longer menstrual bleeding they experienced because women are excluded from religious functions during menstruation, particularly in the Hindu religion.</p><p>The majority of husbands expressed concerns about feeling the IUCD thread during intercourse. While it was clear that all men felt that an IUCD compromised their sexual pleasure, they did not report this as a main reason for discontinuing the method. Rather, they echoed women’s concerns about their health due to longer periods of bleeding/spotting. In general, compared with women, men reported being less awareness and having limited understanding of contraception, which made them feel less empowered with respect to decision-making on contraception uptake. Men expressed their interest in knowing more about the IUCD.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our study showed that limited understanding of the benefits of IUCDs among men and women undermines couples’ decision-making and confidence about using this LARC method. To facilitate the uptake and continued use of IUCDs, both men’s and women’s concerns about IUCD usage must be addressed, for example, men’s concerns about their sexual (dis)pleasure and women’s worries about excessive bleeding. Unless this is done, the number of dissatisfied IUCD users will continue to increase, which will further discourage other women in the community from considering the IUCD. Therefore, service providers need to be proactive in discussing contraceptive choices with couples who attend their facilities, clarifying misconceptions around IUCDs. If they do so, the attitudes of their clients towards IUCDs can become more positive, and couples who opt for IUCDs will more likely be satisfied users.</p><p>Given that our study showed that women do not decide alone – they are more likely to consult their husbands and listen to friends and family – couples who are satisfied with their use of IUCDs can be invited to share their experiences with other couples. This could especially help men with joint decision-making.</p><p>Men’s interest in knowing more about the IUCD suggests there is an opportunity for service providers to involve men further in family planning programmes. Men’s role in helping women makes the right contraceptive choice for them as a couple can be facilitated by directing educational and counselling interventions towards men.</p>",

      "title": "Building Interfaith Alliances for Family Planning in Nigeria: Using Evidence and Interfaith Dialogue to Promote Faith-based Advocacy for Family Planning",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Significant efforts have been made to increase knowledge and use of family planning in Nigeria. Despite high knowledge of family planning methods in Nigeria (85 percent of women and 95 percent of men, age 15-49, know at least one method), and the greater percentage of women across Nigeria that want to delay (for at least two years) or stop child bearing, contraceptive use remains low.</p><p>Religion is probably the strongest belief system that has existed for thousands of years. It shapes the behavior, especially health-seeking behaviors, of many people. In Nigeria, both individual and political decisions often have their roots deep in religious beliefs and injunctions and, since the introduction of the FP program, religious leaders have been a strong voice.</p><p>The Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI 2) - a family planning (FP) program that uses a three-pronged intervention model of advocacy, service delivery and demand generation - recognized the crucial role of religious leaders and created alliances with notable leaders of the two major faiths in Nigeria to achieve a sustainable supportive environment for increased use of modern FP methods.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>NURHI established active and vibrant Interfaith Forums, at its state and local levels of implementation, as a network of faith-based advocates who speak up positively about FP and engender dialogue within their spheres of influence; assessed the relationship between religious leaders’ communication efforts and improved family planning ideation, intention and use in Nigeria and; created platforms to nurture cross-faith learnings through an Interfaith Key Learnings meeting (a big step for faith-based advocacy for FP in Nigeria) where religious leaders deliberated on issues and challenges militating against reproductive health and FP in Nigeria and their roles in mitigating those challenges.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Initial stakeholder meetings were held with religious leaders of the two major faith groups, first at the level of their institutions and then at the community levels. These engagements, which focused on creating partnerships and building networks with well-known and respected faith leaders, culminated in the inauguration of the Interfaith Forums. By training members on FP messaging and the science of advocacy, the interfaith forums were programmed to lead faith-based engagements and dialogues within their communities, at the state level and at national learning events and forums.</p><p>To assess the link between religious leaders’ advocacy and improved contraceptive ideation, intention and use, NURHI 2’s biannual monitoring cross-sectional survey data was used to examine the relationship between exposure to positive speeches from religious leaders and contraceptive ideation and intention to use family planning. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Supportive statements are continuously being harvested from religious leaders of both the Christian and Islamic faiths through media tracking and at community or state level events. NURHI’s strategic advocacy agenda and work with religious leaders have also birthed vibrant champions who not only serve as inspiring voices for Family Planning/Childbirth Spacing (FP/CBS) in their communities, but have also gone a step further to engage in extensive community-based activities to create awareness and inform communities of the benefits of FP.</p><p>By promoting dialogues and cross faith learnings, religious leaders are increasingly taking ownership of the FP agenda and are learning to apply the science of advocacy to their efforts. Among the notable outcomes of the interfaith key learnings meeting was the consensus by religious leaders that their efforts to promote the practice of FP/CBS do not simply add numbers to the national goal of increasing the CPR but have the potential to save lives.</p><p>The evidence garnered from NURHI 2 cross-sectional survey showed that a significant number of women will not use contraceptives if they perceive that their religious leaders do not approve. Compared to women who were not exposed, women who were exposed to religious leaders speaking in favor of FP were more likely to reject myths about FP, start up a conversation about FP and were twice as likely to use FP even if others did not. Religious leaders have found this evidence overwhelming and commit to strengthening their institutional structures to promote reproductive health and family planning messaging.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>One of the key ideational factors for uptake of contraceptives and continued use is religious belief. Building alliances with religious leaders, using scientific information, supported by evidence, to address concerns and questions they might have about the subject matter significantly enhances their understanding and confidence in promoting family planning.</p><p>Efforts to adequately engage religious leaders has resulted in increasing visibility and public endorsement of FP by key religious leaders and this is gradually creating the positive impact being observed in the country. This is evidenced by large scale public discussions, enhanced media-based advocacy and coverage of family planning issues as well as increased funding and commitment by government and the resulting increase in FP uptake by women of reproductive age.</p><p>Identifying religious leaders – who are influential and trusted members of their communities – to clarify the position of the various religions on family planning and express their support for family planning openly, is key to success.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>While government policies and programs can have tremendous impact on health and well-being, fundamental changes in Malawi’s population and development trajectory are unlikely to occur until social norms shift to support women and girls’ empowerment, and Malawians choose to have smaller families. As approximately 97% of Malawians align with a faith, which often governs customs and traditional law and practices, religious leaders’ support for changing social norms is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of family planning (FP) practices. A 2015 survey conducted by the USAID-funded Health Policy Project (HPP) found that religious leaders have an opportunity to raise the profile of FP and population issues. Seventy-two percent of adults in two districts surveyed agreed that religious leaders should play a role in guiding their congregations on the benefits of FP, suggesting the public is open to religious leaders asserting the acceptability of FP methods and promoting access to information and services.</p><p>Religious leaders have enduring presence in local communities, and frequently have networks beyond those of government or development partners. Further, many have multiple entry points to engage with youth and other populations. They are well-positioned to deliver FP and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) messages. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Building on HPP's work, Health Policy Plus (HP+) sensitized religious leaders on the importance of FP and to incorporate FP messages into sermons and events. HP+ issued grants to six religious institutions to use the <em>Faithful Voices </em>advocacy guides to promote faith-based dialogue on population and FP.  </p><p>ACT Alliance, funded through KfW implemented a four-year project, <em>Strengthening Public and Private Partnerships in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights</em>. With Catholic, Muslim, and Protestant partners, they addressed significant religious and cultural barriers and increased youth access to SRHR/FP services by promoting open discussion in churches and mosques and supporting demand creation. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>HP+ provided grants and technical support to the Malawi Council of Churches, Seventh Day Adventists, the Episcopal Conference of Malawi, the Evangelical Association of Malawi, Quadria Muslim Association, and the Muslim Association of Malawi to design and implement FP advocacy interventions. Each mother body undertook various types of sensitization and advocacy efforts, including community dialogues and meetings with traditional leaders, youth, and media to promote modern FP methods. The six faith groups partnered with the government to advocate to their congregations on population growth management and FP, with the goal of changing social norms around FP and childbearing. HP+ collected their activity reports at the midterm and end of the grant period.</p><p>ACT Alliance provided funds and technical support to Evangelical Association of Malawi, Blantyre Synod Health and Development Commission, Quadria Muslim Association of Malawi, Catholic Health Commission and Livingstonia Synod Health Department. Partners focused on addressing institutional barriers within the FBOs, churches, mosques and communities. Dan Church Aid and Norwegian Church Aid led institutional capacity building interventions that enabled FBOs to implement effective SRHR and FP interventions.  Faith-based SRHR Advocacy Strategy and Youth Teaching Guides were developed for advocacy and implementation in uniform, faith-based approach to SRHR/FP programming. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Under the yearlong HP+ grant, the mother bodies promoted a faith-based understanding of FP, reaching 116 youth, 214 religious leaders, 30 women leaders, 30 community leaders, and 7,461 other congregants with workshops and trainings, including TOTs. They engaged with media to disseminate FP messages, worked with youth to develop short plays, and used “population weekend” events to deliver outreach and advocacy messages. They engaged with district leaders to make policy recommendations, advocate on population and development issues, and discuss the roles and responsibilities of government and faith leaders in ensuring access to FP services. These activities have led to increased acceptance of FP/SRHR information and services and open discussion among congregants and communities.</p><p>Through the ACT Alliance project, FBOs worked with religious and community leaders to address religious, social and cultural issues preventing women and youth from realising their SRHR. They increased youth access to services through community facilitators who provided basic FP services and provision of youth counselling door-to-door. Increased community awareness and strengthened reporting mechanisms for rights violations led to an increase and redress in reported cases. Traditional leaders were effectively engaged to develop and enforce community bylaws aimed at curbing GBV and other rights violations.</p><p>ACT Alliance partners targeted vulnerable groups for SRHR capacity building, including hard-to-reach youth and girls’ clubs. They developed specific tools to institutionalize SRHR beyond the project, such as Muslim and Christian SRHR teaching guides for youth. With technical support from PACT, partner institutions developed policies to guide their approaches to youth SRHR. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Through capacity building, community mobilisation and dialogue, the religious leaders have gained the support of community and traditional leaders, who now champion interventions and messages about modern FP methods and SRHR and understand them as in alignment with religious doctrines.</p><p>These experiences demonstrate that religious leaders can and should be engaged in FP and SRHR programming, both as a specific audience for targeted outreach and as part of mainstream activities. With development partners’ support, local religious leaders designed creative approaches and leveraged their internal institutional structures to reach members of the population who may be resistant to FP and SRHR messaging or have misconceptions that their religion prohibits them from using modern FP methods. These leaders are well-positioned to assume greater ownership and leadership of FP and population issues, and to facilitate dialogue and promote advocacy at the community level that can inform national-level programming. Religious leaders in Malawi are quite willing to share FP messaging with their constituents and able to effectively advocate for FP and SRHR behaviors in alignment with their religious beliefs. This advocacy from trusted faith leaders to their constituents will go a long way toward expanding acceptability of and access to modern FP methods.</p><p>Considering the long-held faith values and beliefs across Malawi, these successes demonstrate how development partners can design and implement SRHR programmes, in particular for youth, that actively engage conservative faith organisations and effectively reach communities to change behavior.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Province in Pakistan has experienced religiously motivated violence and terrorism perpetrated by armed groups, such as the local Taliban affiliate, since 2004. To access health services, women and girls in KPK must navigate this conflict along with a weak health system and a patriarchal, conservative society in which early marriage, low female literacy rates, and poverty are common. Pakistan has one of the lowest modern contraceptive prevalence rates in the region (26%) and KPK is even lower (19%). Approximately 2.25 million abortions are performed annually, the majority of which are unsafe.</p><p>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) initiated a program in Nowshera district in KPK in 2011 to increase access to family planning (FP) and post-abortion care (PAC). In collaboration with provincial and district health authorities, the IRC increased its reach and currently supports 62 health facilities across three districts by strengthening provider capacity, transforming provider attitudes toward FP and PAC, supplying facilities with all necessary supplies and equipment and conducting community mobilization activities.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Recognizing the important role of religion in women’s access to health services in KPK, the IRC strategically engages religious leaders as a central piece of our behavior change communication program to increase access to FP and PAC. The IRC trains religious leaders on the benefits of FP and PAC, discusses the ways in which Islam supports FP use and engages them in their role as opinion-makers to increase community knowledge about and use of FP and PAC.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Beginning in 2012, the IRC educated religious leaders at an Islamic seminary in Nowshera District on the benefits of FP to prevent maternal and infant mortality and improve family wellbeing. Leaders from this institution organized Religious Scholar Conferences to discuss the advantages of FP and PAC and the role of Islam in promoting FP among religious leaders serving mosques in Nowshera, Swabi and Charsadda districts. These religious leaders then facilitated community sessions for married men and women focused on birth spacing and provided information on the availability of FP services. Religious leaders also co-facilitated the training of community health workers (CHW) on FP and PAC community mobilization. Religious leaders addressed CHW concerns and apprehension related to delivering FP and PAC messages to the community and offered religious messages on FP and PAC that were incorporated into information sessions.</p><p>The IRC collects service statistics from health facility registers on the number of clients who accept modern FP methods, by method, the number of clients who receive PAC and the number and percent of PAC clients who adopt FP.  These data are entered and analyzed in a DHIS2 database. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Since 2012, the IRC has engaged 360 religious leaders to increase awareness about the benefits of FP and PAC in KPK. From 2012-2017, 80,019 clients accepted modern FP methods and 46% accepted long acting or permanent methods in IRC-supported health facilities in KPK. Further, 7,570 PAC clients were treated and 60% accepted an FP method. The number of FP clients served has increased each year from 12,651 new FP acceptors in 2013 to 19,654 in 2017. While these results are due to a combination of factors, including provider capacity building and provision of supplies, engaging religious leaders as partners played a critical role in achieving these results.  </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>In this setting where a strict interpretation of Islam influences culture, laws and acceptable community practices, engaging religious leaders as partners in this program was essential to increasing use of FP and PAC services. An important component of this success was linking program goals with religious leaders’ community priorities and using their expertise on religious texts to craft messages favorable to FP and PAC. These efforts encouraged men, women, and key community figures to regard FP as an important service to ensure the family wellbeing that is also consistent with their religious beliefs. Service providers were also less reluctant to provide FP and PAC since these services were less stigmatized and viewed favorably by the community and religious leaders. It is critical for FP programs in religiously conservative societies to engage religious leaders as allies, rather than barriers, in order to increase access to services.</p><p>While the IRC’s strategy to engage religious leaders has been effective, it is also important to acknowledge that the approach is limited to the practices supported by these religious leaders. Religious leaders in KPK do not promote FP for unmarried women and some promote natural FP methods over modern methods. Furthermore, religious messages promoting FP continue to reinforce the decision-making power of the male partner rather than empower women to make decisions about their own health.  Additional strategies are needed to increase access to FP for unmarried women and girls and to better integrate gender transformative programming into SRH services in KPK.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Au Bénin, l’utilisation des contraceptifs modernes pour la planification familiale demeure faible. Selon les résultats de l’Enquête Démographique et de Santé (2012), ce taux est de 7,9% avec une augmentation entre 2012 et 2014 pour atteindre 12,5% (MICS, 2014). Avec un taux de mortalité maternelle de 347 pour 100.000 naissances vivantes, les besoins non satisfaits des femmes de 15-49 ans actuellement mariées ou en union sont estimés à 33% (MICS, 2014).</p><p>Selon une analyse situationnelle menée par le Ministère de la Santé en 2014 dans le cadre de l’élaboration plan du repositionnement de la PF, les perceptions erronées de certains leaders religieux et les attitudes pro-natalistes ont été considérées comme des barrières liées à l’utilisation de la PF. La religion exerce une influence sur les comportements matrimoniaux : les doctrines et valeurs religieuses constituent le tableau de bord de décision des populations en matière de procréation. 94,2% des béninoises pratiquent au moins une religion, selon le Recensement Général de la Population et de l’Habitat (2013).</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Pour améliorer la perception des leaders religieux sur la PF, l’ABMS/PSI exécute le projet ‘’Les Religieux s’engagent’’ grâce aux financements de l’Ambassade du Royaume des Pays-Bas du programme Jeune S3. Ce projet d’implication des leaders religieux pour la création d’un environnement plus favorable à la PF vise à engager et soutenir au moins quinze associations confessionnelles et cinq centres de santé confessionnels. Démarré en mai 2013, les leaders religieux formés par les associations confessionnelles selon le principe du « faire-faire » sensibilisent les leaders religieux et les fidèles de 15-49 ans dans 52 communes des 77 du Bénin.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>L’ABMS/PSI a eu des séances d’échange avec les responsables nationaux de chaque association religieuse identifiée. Chaque association confessionnelle reçoit des formations sur la gestion financière et programmatique, et signe annuellement, avec l’ABMS/PSI, des accords de subvention sur la base des plans d’actions élaborés avec l’appui des personnes ressources et validés par un comité interministériel présidé par le Ministère de la Santé. Les associations organisent des séances de plaidoyer intra-religion, et des formations des religieux. Les religieux formés font de la communication interpersonnelle sur la PF auprès des couples et surtout les hommes lors des cultes et des rencontres religieuses. Ces activités sont renforcées par les émissions télévisées et radiophoniques. Les relais réfèrent les femmes vers les formations sanitaires confessionnelles, publiques ou privées avec lesquels leur association a établi des partenariats pour offrir des services PF en stratégies fixes et mobiles. Les activités sont supervisées par le comité interministériel et l’ABMS/PSI, qui assure également le suivi de routine des interventions.</p><p>Pour évaluer le niveau des connaissances des fidèles, l’ABMS/PSI a commandité une étude quantitative en 2017. L’étude a porté sur 953 fidèles mariés âgés d’au moins dix-huit ans exposés aux interventions du projet et un groupe témoin de 950 fidèles non-exposés.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Dix-huit associations traditionnelles, chrétiennes et islamiques sont engagées dans la promotion des méthodes contraceptives conformes à leur doctrine tout en respectant la politique du choix informé. Ces associations ont organisé 69 séances de plaidoyers sur la PF à l’endroit de 3.821 leaders religieux dont 584 femmes. A l’issue de ces séances, 2.966 relais identifiés parmi les leaders religieux et fidèles laïcs ont été formés sur la PF et mènent des causeries éducatives. Pour assurer l’offre de services de qualité aux fidèles désireux d’adopter une méthode PF, les associations religieuses ont engagé 12 centres de santé confessionnels et ont développé un partenariat avec 32 centres des santé publics et privés implantées dans leurs zones d’intervention. Ces activités ont permis aux associations religieuses de contribuer au recrutement de 14.676 nouvelles utilisatrices de méthodes modernes de PF de 2014 à fin 2017. </p><p>Cet engagement ayant abouti au recrutement de nouvelles utilisatrices de méthodes contraceptives par les leaders religieux est une preuve d’un début d’amélioration des perceptions des fidèles sur la PF suite aux interventions. Les résultats de l’évaluation des connaissances en 2017 ont montré que la proportion des hommes exposés aux interventions du projet qui déclarent être capables de discuter de l’utilisation d’une méthode de PF avec leurs partenaires est plus importante que celle des non-exposés (55,2% des exposés contre 37,1% des témoins).</p><p>Pour assurer la pérennisation des interventions et une synergie des actions, une plateforme nationale des structures religieuses engagées pour la PF est créée et son comité de gestion installé.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Le recrutement des nouvelles utilisatrices des méthodes modernes de PF grâce aux activités de CIP et à l’organisation de campagnes d’offre de PF en partenariat avec des centres de santé publics et privés montre que l’engagement des leaders religieux dans la promotion de la PF est une expérience réussie et qui mérite d’être poursuivie. Ce projet a montré, sur la base des résultats obtenus, que les leaders religieux peuvent jouer un rôle important dans l’augmentation de l’utilisation des méthodes contraceptives modernes, à condition qu’ils soient mieux informés et responsabilisés dans la mise en œuvre des activités de promotion de la PF pour espacer ou limiter les naissances.</p><p>En complément des stratégies citées ci-haut, pour rendre plus efficace le travail avec les leaders religieux dans la promotion de la PF, il est important d’intégrer l’approche transformatrice du genre pour promouvoir la masculinité positive et de promouvoir la participation significative des jeunes aux activités des leaders religieux. Ceci afin d’améliorer les échanges entre couples sur la PF et de favoriser aussi la prévention des grossesses précoces et non désirées en facilitant l’accès des jeunes, des femmes et des filles-mères aux services de PF de qualité.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Les faibles taux d’utilisation de la contraception dans les régions septentrionales et de l’Est du Cameroun (entre 4,5% et 23,7% selon la région), sont généralement imputables aux résistances socioculturelles, avec des idées reçues selon lesquelles, la religion serait contre le planning familial. En 2015, une étude réalisée par l’Association Camerounaise pour le Marketing Social (ACMS), n’avait pas confirmé ces préjugés, mais a néanmoins montré la prééminence de l’opinion masculine et celle des leaders traditionnels et religieux dans le processus de prise de décisions, dans une société conservatrice comme celle du septentrion.</p><p>Le Programme d’Accès aux Services de la Santé de la Reproduction, sous un financement bilatéral de la République Fédérale d’Allemagne et du Gouvernement Camerounais, a développé des stratégies de communication ciblant les femmes, les hommes, mais aussi les leaders religieux  pour porter le message sur le planning familial.</p><p>Le présent article se propose donc de décrire l’expérience de ce projet y compris les principaux résultats obtenus.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Le programme est mise en œuvre dans quatre régions du Cameroun (Extrême-Nord, Nord, Adamaoua et l’Est) avec pour but de contribuer à la réduction de la mortalité maternelle à travers l’accroissement de la prévalence contraceptive. L’un des résultats stipule qu’au bout des quatre années de la phase actuelle, les groupes cibles possèdent une meilleure connaissance des méthodes de planning familial. Et c’est pour atteindre ce résultat que l’activité de plaidoyer envers et avec les leaders religieux est implémentée à côté des autres activités de communication pour le changement de comportement. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Ce partage d’expérience concerne la période de février 2017 à février 2018 et se restreint à la région du Nord. Deux leaders religieux (consultant leader musulman et Chrétien), proposés par le Lamido de Garoua et par le président du conseil des églises protestantes ont été contractualisés, puis formés  pour conduire auprès de leurs pairs, des réunions de plaidoyer en faveur du planning familial dans les chefferies, les lieux de cultes et autres espaces communautaires.</p><p>Sur la base d’une fiche d’adhésion, ils identifient à chaque réunion, les leaders convaincus et disposer à porter le message de planning familial. Le rôle des leaders touchés est donc de mobiliser, sensibiliser et référer à leur tour, les populations vers les formations sanitaires du réseau ProFam® pour prise d’informations et adoption éventuelle d’une méthode contraceptive.</p><p>La présentation des résultats de cette expérience sera purement descriptive en termes de méthodes d’approche des consultants (bonne pratique), de nombre de leaders touchés et du niveau d’adhésion. Cette démarche se fondant sur le fait que, plus on touchera de personnes, plus on diffusera les connaissances sur le planning familial.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>En termes de méthode utilisée, outre les réunions de plaidoyer conduites individuellement dans leurs obédiences religieuses respectives, les consultants leaders religieux ont eux mêmes développés une approche novatrice  concertée leur permettant de conduire ensemble certaines séances, réunissant en un même lieu, des participants aussi bien chrétiens que musulmans.</p><p>Au total 70 réunions de plaidoyers ont été tenues au cours de la période de référence pour 3 193 leaders touchées dont : 1 726 chrétiens, 581 musulmans et 876 chefs traditionnels. Le niveau d’adhésion est de l’ordre de 99%, traduisant l’efficacité de l’approche utilisée pour convaincre les leaders.</p><p>De ces expériences vécues, les participants sont unanimes sur le fait que la planification familiale est importante pour préserver la santé de la mère et de l’enfant. S’inspirant du Coran et de la Bible, les participants contribuaient eux même à l’enrichissement de l’argumentaire ; ce qui les prépare d’ores et déjà au rôle de relais qu’ils sont appelés à jouer dans leurs communautés respectives.</p><p>Concernant la fréquentation des services de planning familial, effort combiné de toutes les équipes de terrain, l’on a noté sur la période, une augmentation soutenue des nouvelles clientes (151%) dans  65 formations sanitaires du réseau ProFam®, passant de 686 à 1 751.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Au regard des résultats obtenus et compte tenu des préjugés en matière de planification familiale dans la zone d’étude, la stratégie engrange plutôt de succès considérables. Les principales leçons apprises seraient :</p><ul>\t<li>Le fait que la religion n’est pas contre la contraception.

      "title": "Reconciling faith, family planning and contraceptive use in Burundi ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Burundi has one of the highest fertility rates in the world, estimated at 5.6 children per woman between 2010-2015 (UNFPA). This is coupled with a high maternal mortality ratio of 740 deaths per 100,000 live births, chronic malnutrition - currently estimated at 56% (BDHS, 2017) and resultant extreme poverty in Burundian households. While the government of Burundi and other actors continue to invest resources to address Family Planning (FP), low knowledge, deep rooted harmful social norms, and disempowering faith beliefs have inhibited progress. With up to 94% (2008 census) of Burundi’s population identifying with a religious group, the role of faith and faith actors in shaping societal attitudes, beliefs and norms around gender relations and sexuality including FP cannot be ignored. Explicit and implicit opposition from faith leaders, including uninformed religious messaging on family planning and misleading interpretations of the Holy Scriptures,  prevent men and women from being empowered to make informed family planning decisions. On the other hand, faith leaders’ tremendous convening power and trust makes them a critical partner in challenging negative beliefs, norms and attitudes related to reproductive health and gender relations.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>By focusing on reconciling faith, FP and contraceptive use, Christian Aid has mobilised faith leaders across faiths and empowered them to 1) understand sexual and reproductive health and FP, 2) promote sexual and gender rights and challenge harmful cultural norms, 3) develop effective scriptural messaging for educating and supporting their congregations to exercise choice in this area. Faith leaders received training, faith-based communication resources and were linked with health workers. They were supported to conduct awareness sessions in their congregations, communities and through small group approaches such as counselling for couples to improve dialogue between women and men on family</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The project was implemented between January 2016 and December 2017 in 5 provinces (Bujumbura, Bururi, Makamba, Rumonge and Rutana) reaching 74,320 people (44,592F/29,728M). A total of 254 religious leaders (RLs) from both Christian and Muslim faiths were engaged through existing leadership structures and networks including the Anglican Province of Burundi (PEAB), Network of Faith Based Organisations For Integral Well-being of the Family (RCBIF), World Outreach Initiatives (WOI) and Burundi Network of Religious Leaders Living or Affected by HIV (BUNERELA+). They were trained as agents of change, working alongside community health workers, women and youth leaders and supported to implement action plans, integrating FP education in their daily work. Together with local health committees, they ensured that communities’ concerns around FP were addressed. A two-fold approach was used to 1) get RLs to actively engage in FP dialogue and 2) engage them in damage limitation so as to reduce the harm caused by speaking out against FP. Project results were monitored through routine data and periodic surveys.  For the final evaluation, 408 beneficiaries (direct and indirect) were interviewed providing a representative sample (CI 95% - margin 5%). Quantitative and qualitative data was collected, integrating community feedback for project reflection.  </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>85.71% of RLs interviewed during the end of project evaluation had referred information seekers on the choice of contraceptive methods to health facilities. In addition, 93.60% of study respondents reported that they had received education from RLs on sexual and gender rights including social norms, with 97% reporting change of behaviour and/or attitudes in relation to family planning. A gender and power analysis conducted before the project revealed that men were not actively involved in health promotion, they are regarded as the ‘decision makers’ in the family, with women having not power to challenge these decisions. By the end of the project, 85.83% pregnant women had been accompanied by their partners to SRH and FP services over the last 12 months out of which, 97.24% (up from 87% in 2016) reported having discussions about birth spacing and birth control with their partners.  The proportion of respondents who rarely discuss FP with their spouses decreased from 15.19% to 2.43%.  Unmet need for family planning among target communities (mainly congregation members) reduced by 63.8% (from 81% to 18%) within the project period. Faith leaders were ranked 2nd most important influencers of contraceptive use (after community health workers). There has been a remarkable improvement in the attitude and willingness of faith leaders to promote use of family planning awareness and only 19% faith leaders reported not willing to promote modern FP methods because of their religious beliefs.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<ul>\t<li>\t<p>Faith leaders are powerful influencers in reducing negative dialogue surrounding FP within their followers and the wider community. Empowering faith leaders to use their established and trusted platforms provides unique opportunity to deliver good value for money.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Public health can be a key entry point, when combined with a theological approach that reconciles scientific facts and scriptural references, to address family planning and a wide spectrum of issues under the sexual reproductive health and rights banner</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>It’s important to develop multi-stakeholder partnerships which include and make faith actors accountable in the delivery of key public health messages which aim to reduce harmful practices that threaten the lives of women and girls.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>A multi-stakeholder partnership which includes faith actors should not see faith partners as institutional gatekeepers who contribute only social capital resources such as access to communities and volunteers.

      "title": "Reducing maternal mortality by building the capacity of traditional faith leaders, a successful working model in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The maternal mortality rate in Uganda of 343 per 100,000, together with a fertility rate of 6 babies born per woman, are among the highest in the region. This creates a crisis for Ugandans growing up today and new creative ways to reduce population growth and maternal mortality require urgent attention. Traditional silence around sexuality, pregnancy and birth has perpetuated myths and dangerous practices. For example, girls are often told by men that abstinence causes menstrual pain and may lead to later infertility. This contributes to early sexual activity, unwanted teenage pregnancy, dangerous abortions, school drop outs, obstructed labours and obstetric fistulas, HIV and the continuing cycle of poverty. It is a Christian country and faith leaders have a major influence in decision making around family size. Male faith leaders are cultural gatekeepers and have the greatest authority and influence over cultural values and the adoption of new ideas. But there is little or no practical skills training to engage men in learning about the reproductive life cycle of women in Christian educational institutions. Bridging the information gap between traditional faith leaders and medical professionals is therefore the most urgent need in Uganda to reduce maternal mortality.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Wise Choices for Life (WCFL) model trains non-medical community leaders about puberty, sex, conception, pregnancy, birth, family planning and the environment. By combining a medically sound curriculum with traditional forms of communication (drama, debate, song and dance), WCFL empowers leaders to confidently and sensitively explain the consequences of risky behaviour and challenge generally accepted myths.  The training includes a safe space to discuss myths about obstructed labour, fistula, haemorrhage and infection. It provides communication practice sessions as well as imparting knowledge and encourages a critical reading of the Bible in light of current knowledge.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Our workshops, led by accredited Ugandan WCFL trainers, engage the full spectrum of society. With endorsement from the Ugandan Ministry of Health, the Church of Uganda and the Christian University, the workshops include civic leaders, religious leaders, parents and teachers. The life skills we focus on are Critical thinking, Decision making, Relationship building and Communication skills. </p><p>Our model of community-midwifery education, based on train-the-trainer workshops, includes the critical combination of faith, culture and science. Our eight-day workshops take </p><p>place in familiar surroundings like churches and universities, always away from hospital environments. With groups of thirty we can develop healthy debate about faith and cultural practices. The beneficiaries include pastors, youth workers, teachers, parents and caregivers of orphaned children. Each workshop has an evaluation, but we need to begin community impact evaluation. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>With critical thinking and empowered decision-making at the core, Wise Choices for Life has been a successful pilot program. Many are for the first time discussing taboo topics in a safe public space. Ugandans are engaging with the medical world and being challenged to question their default position on these topics. The hope and freedom this brings to many has been truly powerful to witness. In the typical month of January, 870 people of the Mbale community received messages about puberty, critical thinking, family planning and developing safe relationships. The overwhelming responses from these community training sessions were requests for more. </p><p>The most widely heard comment is, “I did not know we could discuss this, I thought only medically trained people could talk about this.”And, “I wish I knew this earlier in life, I would have used it in my church work amongst the youth”. </p><p>From prisoners we hear, “If I had been given this information earlier I would have been able to avoid my mistakes” </p><p>The three Ugandan prisons currently using WCFL have noted a change in the inmates’ behaviour toward each other, and wardens are requesting training for themselves. The Chief Administrative Officer in Mbale district has signed an MOU with WCFL requesting our training in 100 schools. We have started with peer education until more support is available. Moving toward registration, opportunities are available but we require funding support to multiply our trainers and develop monitoring and evaluation tools to expand the work. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Family planning education in developing countries must adapt to work within different social, cultural and spiritual contexts. Traditional female-based education will not reach the critical mass of men or the spectrum of society required to affect change on a societal level. </p><p>This is a work in progress, requiring more input from stakeholders to deliver family planning education in a respectful and relevant way without compromising quality. Community health education can then, fulfil its role to bridge the gap between how things are, and how they could be. Since 2013 we have produced 287 trainers, yet we need assistance for follow up, monitoring and evaluating of the impact in community. </p><p>According to the National Council for Higher Education there are twenty-three theological institutions, plus two Christian and one Islamic university in Uganda. Introducing our eight- day module in reproductive health and family planning into their curriculum would equip, empower and encourage future pastors and religious leaders to communicate the benefits of smaller families and controlling fertility. </p><p>By realigning our educational efforts in accord with traditional gender roles, we could reach leaders of the faith institutions and colleges who would otherwise be excluded from the conversation about family planning. This necessitates a change from medical and women focussed education to religious institutions and male faith leaders. </p><p>Fertility rate : </p><p>Uganda Population. (2017-12-21).

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Economic growth and constraints in donor financing have increased attention on donor transitions in lower middle-income countries. Many donors use gross national income (GNI) along with other criteria to determine eligibility for aid. When countries surpass eligibility thresholds, donors typically initiate a process of transitioning responsibility for financing interventions to national governments and/or other sources of domestic funding. How to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of interventions during and after transition becomes a key question, especially in countries with constrained resources and where multiple donors are transitioning simultaneously.</p><p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is an important funder of family planning in several countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. UNFPA’s funding eligibility criteria prioritizes resources to countries with the lowest GNI and greatest need in sexual and reproductive health outcomes. In a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region, UNFPA will start planning processes to gradually transition responsibility for financing modern contraceptives, reflecting in part the dynamism of the economic performance of the region in recent years. However, little is known about what factors might contribute to a successful transition and the readiness of countries to do so. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We conduct transition readiness assessments in Lao PDR and Timor-Leste, asking whether governments are prepared for the transition of responsibility for financing contraceptives from UNFPA to domestic funding. We define transition readiness through the concepts of sustainable financing and effective coverage.</p><p>We assess the level of readiness in Lao PDR and Timor-Leste through comparison with Cambodia, which recently successfully transitioned out of support from UNFPA for financing contraceptives. We identify factors key to Cambodia’s success in securing sustainable financing and effective coverage after UNFPA transition, and assess the extent to which these factors are present in Lao PDR and Timor-Leste.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>UNFPA’s Asia Pacific Regional Office commissioned the Nossal Institute to conduct mixed method case studies in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Timor-Leste in late 2016. Our case study design included: (a) rapid reviews of both published and grey literature; and (b) semi-structured key-informant interviews.</p><p>We conducted interviews with family planning policy makers and advocates in each country: Cambodia, Timor-Leste  and Lao PDR. Together with the UNFPA Country Offices in each country, we chose participants from a purposive sample, including representatives from the Ministry of Health, the UNFPA Country Office, bilateral and multilateral health donors, and international and local non-government organisations. Interview questions focused on domestic support for family planning, awareness of transition, and perceptions on the likelihood of successful transition.</p><p>We analysed data from the literature review and interviews for each country concurrently using a framework analysis.  We presented the findings from each case study in separate reports to UNFPA. We then conducted a comparative analysis across the three case studies to: identify factors key to a successful transition in Cambodia; and assess to what extent these success factors exist in Lao PDR and Timor-Leste. Ethics approval to undertake the comparative data analysis was obtained from the University of Melbourne.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The total cost of contraceptives in all three countries is ultimately relatively small, when compared to other health or government budget lines, and did not emerge as a factor crucial to the success of transition. Rather the three factors that we identified as crucial to transition in Cambodia were: (i) unity amongst family planning stakeholders in relation to the need for and timing of transition; (ii) national capacity to promote advocacy efforts to support increases in domestic financing for family planning; and (iii) open and stable policy space for family planning.</p><p>Restricting assessment of readiness to the three factors above, are Lao PDR and Timor-Leste ready to transit out of UNFPA’s financing for commodities? In Timor-Leste, we found little consensus and communication amongst family planning stakeholders about the need for and timing of transition, as well as the future family planning policy. For Lao PDR, good communication and policy dialogue between family planning stakeholders exists at the national level, however, given the decentralised nature of the health system in Lao PDR, this needs to be extended to the provinces. The national capacity to advocate for increased financing for family planning, including with the use of economic evidence, needs to be strengthened in both countries – for instance, with greater opportunity for Ministry of Health staff to play leading roles in advocating for transition with their counterparts in the Ministry of Finance. More preparation would be needed for a future transition to succeed in either context.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>We identify factors that influenced Cambodia’s successful transition from UNFPA support for financing of contraceptives and assess the presence of those factors in Lao PDR and Timor-Leste as a proxy for readiness to transition. To our knowledge, this is the first time that success factors associated with UNFPA’s transition in a given context have been identified, and used as a basis for assessing readiness in other contexts.</p><p>While in-depth analysis has been undertaken in countries that have transitioned from financing for family planning programs provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the challenges faced by UNFPA in achieving a sustainable and effective transition differ for two main reasons. First, UNFPA has acted as backstop for other donors during their transition (as was the case for USAID in Latin America). UNFPA is likely to be the final donor to withdraw from financing contraceptives, unless innovative financing is mobilised which may be difficult in the current climate. Second, as a multilateral donor, UNFPA has more limited policy levers than USAID in advocating with national governments to increase their financing for contraceptives.</p><p>Our analysis contributes to transition planning by UNFPA and governments in the Asia Pacific and will also be valuable for other multilateral donors as they prepare to transition out of support for health programs in the region. Moreover, the findings are relevant to stakeholders in low-income countries where UNFPA continues to scale up its support to family planning programs, but needs to begin preparing for transition now.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Ethiopia has experienced two decades of rapid growth in contraceptive use. From 2000 to 2016 the number of women using modern contraceptive methods grew from 600,000 to 6 million and the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) among married women increased from 6% to 35%. Ethiopia aims to further accelerate this impressive progress to achieve its FP2020 goal of 55% mCPR. However, the massive gains made to date have been almost entirely financed by external sources. As of 2014, an estimated 96% of family planning (FP) commodities in Ethiopia were purchased with donor funds. But, in recent years, donor funding for FP has begun to decline. In 2018, USAID, once the largest single funder of contraceptives in Ethiopia, ceased funding for commodity procurement. </p><p>At the same time, Ethiopia has undertaken a series of health reforms aimed at achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes have been launched in more than one-third of districts and a social health insurance (SHI) bill has been passed and awaits implementation. Expansion of access to health services in rural areas through the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health’s (FMOH) Health Extension Program (HEP) has played a major role in increasing access to FP. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The implementation and expansion of these schemes presents an opportunity to unlock new financing for FP in Ethiopia. The USAID-funded Health Policy Plus (HP+) project is supporting the Ethiopia FMOH and its development partners to create a vision for how to leverage a variety of financing mechanisms to achieve and sustain a high level of mCPR, by answering the questions:</p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>How many FP users will be supported by each financing scheme?</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>What will the cost be?</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Can the schemes’ current financing mechanisms mobilize sufficient resources to cover this cost; if not, what additional resources will be needed?</p>\t</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>To answer these questions, we developed a three-part approach: </p><p>First, we estimated the total number of FP users and unmet need, annually, from 2018 to 2025, based on current trends, disaggregated by urban and rural users, wealth quintile, method source (e.g. public, private, or NGO facilities), and method mix, to understand how future demand would be met and users’ ability and willingness to pay for FP services. </p><p>Second, we calculated the share of clients accessing FP services at public facilities covered by insurance schemes, based on current trends and projections of CBHI and SHI enrollment. We then used data on enrollment, claims, and commodity costs to estimate the total cost to CBHI and SHI of reimbursing FP services. For those not enrolled in CBHI or SHI, we calculated the cost to the FMOH. For clients of private and NGO facilities, we estimated out-of-pocket payments based on willingness to pay. </p><p>Third, we compared the calculated cost to each scheme against contribution rates (for CBHI/SHI) and the FMOH budget for FP commodities and services, considering current and future budgetary trends. For those using private facilities, we calculated the level of subsidies required for commodities in private and NGO facilities. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>At the current rate, Ethiopia will double the number of modern contraceptive users between 2016 and 2025 from 6 million to 12 million. Modern CPR will increase to 49% with implants and IUDs increasing significantly as a share of the modern method mix. However, continued use of injectables, and increasing provision of them in private (non-NGO) facilities, will underlie a shift toward the private sector as a source of methods, from 14% in 2016 to a projected 36% in 2025. HP+ estimated that, by 2025, 90% of private sector clients will use injectables, compared to just 43% of public sector clients. At current trends, NGO facilities will provide 6% of female sterilizations and IUDs and 2% of implants by 2025.</p><p>As a result, services provided in private facilities will account for an estimated 40% of FP costs in 2025. Of this cost, US$19 million will be government-subsidized commodities and US$6 million will be paid by users as fees-for-service. If CHBI targets are achieved (80% of households covered in 80% of districts by 2020) and FP commodities provided in the public sector are reimbursed by CBHI, 31% of total FP costs will shift to these schemes—an annual US$19 million in 2025. This represents 16% of the total estimated CBHI contributions and 12% of total revenues (including government subsidies) of these schemes. Additional government subsidies to the public sector would be needed to cover US$11 million in commodity costs and US$7 million in service delivery, demand generation, and other costs.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This analysis is the first example of a comprehensive plan for a country aiming to ensure the long-term sustainability of FP financing and transition away from donor dependence. It identifies a mix of potential domestic resources for FP and the contributions needed from each to sustain and further scale-up mCPR and prescribes a range of tactics for mobilizing these resources. It quantifies the potential contribution of UHC-oriented insurance schemes to FP financing as well as the impact of leveraging users’ ability to pay to finance a greater share of FP through the private sector. </p><p>From the perspective of the Ethiopian FMOH, this analysis provides an estimate of its FP financing requirements from 2018-2025 to help the ministry and its development partners understand the continued financing needs both in public facilities and in private and NGO facilities, which continue to be donor-dependent for FP commodities. The FMOH has expressed a clear intent to reprioritize health funds as donor support declines. This analysis quantifies the fiscal space available for FP, given this reprioritization, and considers what new sources of funding may be needed to cover the deficit. </p><p>As many countries face imminent declines in donor resources for FP, FP programs will need to better understand the health financing landscape and the range of mechanisms and schemes that provide potential sources of future financing. The analytical approach developed in Ethiopia provides a template for how other countries can develop such analyses and, ultimately, action plans for achieving sustainable, domestic FP financing. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Despite some progress achieved in maternal and child health care in Tajikistan – a landlocked mountainous country with 8.2 million population located in Central Asia with nearly 73.4% of the population living in rural areas and around 60% below age of 24 – many problems causing reproductive losses have not yet been resolved. Since the 1990s, the country has faced a significant decline in fertility: the total fertility rate decreased from 6.3 in the 1990s to 3.2 at present. Although contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) increased from 19.5% in 1995 to 28% in 2012 (DHS), it remains to be the lowest in Central Asia. The total unmet need for Family planning (FP) is higher in rural than urban women and varies from 21 to 28%.</p><p>Since 1995, Tajikistan was a recipient of free contraceptives from the UNFPA global supply programme. In 2015, Tajikistan met criteria for graduation from the UNFPA’s list of priority countries eligible for free contraceptive support. This transition prompted to further accelerate crucial actions at a policy and strategic programming levels to generate demand and secure population access to rights-based FP services and quality commodities.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To overcome the mentioned-above challenges, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) of Tajikistan and UNFPA agreed to develop and implement interlinked strategic course of actions in support of sustainable National FP programme. Advocacy interventions included building evidence-informed arguments with the Government of Tajikistan (GoT) for elaborating and implementing nationally-owned, programmatically sound, people-centered and financially sustainable interventions and making FP a core focus and integral part of the new comprehensive National Action Plan on Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Children and Adolescence Health 2016-2020.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>1. Situation analysis to identify barriers and develop solutions for strengthening the National FP Programme was conducted by the MoHSP of Tajikistan, in partnership with USAID and UNFPA. A comprehensive desk review, in-country site visits at all levels (primary, secondary, tertiary) of health facilities, and key informant interviews were conducted. The recommendations of the situation analysis covered three most important thematic areas in the context of Tajikistan: policy and enabling environment, health systems, and adolescents and young people.</p><p>2. The findings underlay the multisectoral Costed Implementation Plan (CIP) for FP 2017-2020 which underwent review of all national stakeholders. The CIP aimed at reducing the unmet need for FP by 1.5% annual increase in the CPR for modern methods.</p><p>3. UNFPA supported the MoHSP of Tajikistan in the development of the National Communication Strategy on FP, as a key framework to advance the CIP for FP. The major focus of the Strategy is at reaching young people and ensuring that all communication activities are geared toward common objective of behavior change and increasing voluntary uptake of appropriate FP methods.</p><p>4. UNFPA-Tajikistan developed a comprehensive Resource Mobilization Plan to help the GoT to sustain the commitments stipulated in the above strategic documents.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A number of costed interventions with the final budget estimated at US$ 1.9 million were developed to reach the ambitious goals of CIP for FP (2017-2020). To bridge the apparent gap in resources needed for smooth implementation of the CIP commitments, which necessitated significant increase of state funding for the National FP Programme, UNFPA and the GoT developed a project proposal for Strengthening National Family Planning Services in Tajikistan for the period of 2017-2020. The Project with a total budget of US$ 2.7 million aimed at mobilization of supplementary resources for the procurement of contraceptives, outreaching FP services, and increasing the number of FP choices was signed by the Government of Japan, the GoT and UNFPA in early 2017. Resource allocations, based on contributions agreed by parties, had been successfully placed and fully accomplished by all partners. At the end of 2017, the GoT confirmed its 2018 budget contribution of US$ 50,000 represented a 10% annual increase, thus fulfilling its commitment to gradually increase state financing for contraceptive procurement. The actionable roadmap for contraceptive security developed by UNFPA and generous support of the UNFPA Supplies global programme were key to sustain those commitments. In addition, the GoT reassured partners to secure the State funding for the implementation of the CIP for FP and National Communication Strategy on FP developed with the support of UNFPA. Currently preparations to the review of the first year of the Project implementation and the overall progress of the National FP programme are underway.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>As part of a multi-stakeholder initiative, UNFPA managed to emphasize the importance of FP for health and well-being of women and adolescents, which resulted in acknowledging the FP programme and respective targets as a core focus and integral part of the new comprehensive National Action Plan on Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Children and Adolescence Health 2016-2020.</p><p>Committed to advance people-centered and voluntary FP strategies and rights-based approaches, UNFPA developed its National Communication Strategy on FP as an integral and essential part of the sustainable National FP programme. The approach of UNFPA was key to complement the mostly supply-side interventions enshrined in CIP and the actionable roadmap for contraceptive security with those to increase demand for quality FP services and commodities.</p><p>UNFPA is committed to continue pursuing its comprehensive advocacy, forging strategic partnerships with regional and global networks such as FP2020, and technical support to help the Government of Tajikistan to sustain the implementation of its commitments and strengthening accountability towards sustainable national FP programme.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>For more than ten years, the Population Council (PC) has designed and implemented successful programs for girls and adolescents throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America that have impacted the domains of self-esteem, health, social capital, and livelihoods, resulting in delays of early unions/marriages, improved literacy, increased girls’ abilities to save money, and increased rates of school attainment. Until recently, PC’s girl-centered programs in Latin America had been focused on the successful experience of the<em> Abriendo Oportunidades </em>(AO) (“Opening Opportunities”) program in Guatemala, designed to close health, education, and other development indicator gaps between rural indigenous girls and their non-indigenous peers. This evidence-based program is a model designed to build assets that favorably correlate with participants’ continued school enrollment, higher academic achievement, motivation and aspirations, delay in age of marriage and first pregnancy, and greater social visibility and participation. Building on PC’s global experience with girl-centered programs and using the AO program as a model, the project aims to reach disadvantaged girls living in the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, where no similar strategies had been implemented before. We believe that through girls’ programming, we can contribute to build self-reliant communities by offering girls a greater opportunity to succeed.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p><em>Abriendo Futuros </em>(AF) (“Opening Futures”) is a two-year intervention in Yucatan, Mexico, that aims to improve the life conditions of young Mayan adolescent girls (AGs) in by creating safe spaces where they can meet with trained mentors to learn about different topics that will strengthen their repertoire of life skills, promote empowerment, and contribute to improve their quality of life, as well as engage in recreational activities with their peers. The long-term outcomes of this grant-funded pilot intervention are to assess the feasibility of implementation in Yucatan, prevent school dropout, and reduce teen pregnancy among AGs enrolled in AF.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>AF reaches AGs before the tipping point when they are more likely to drop out of school to reduce their vulnerability to the main threats of school desertion, including early marriage and motherhood. The AF program and curriculum was adapted from AO to the local context of Yucatan and ran from September 2015 to June 2017. The program enrolled a total of 657 AGs aged 11-17 and weekly sessions were divided into 6 modules (of about 12-14 weeks each) where AGs met with mentors to learn about a wide variety of topics, including: sexual and reproductive health education; building self-esteem; leadership development; empowerment and autonomy; personal hygiene and care; girl’s and women’s rights; gender-based violence; nutrition and healthy living; and financial literacy; among others. The project follows a quasi-experimental design in eight intervention communities with three matched comparison communities. Program impact is being measured with quantitative household panel surveys at baseline, midline, and endline. Measured outcomes among AGs include: a) knowledge of SRHR topics covered in the AF curriculum; b) school enrollment, attendance, and drop-out rates; c) adolescent pregnancy rate; c) self-perceived social support; and, d) self-esteem and social capital.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results-to-date indicate that AF enrollment has increased steadily in all intervention communities, and by June 2017, we had a total of 657 enrolled AGs (representing approximately 50% of the complete universe of AGs living in the communities); however, retention remains a challenge. Preliminary findings from the midline household survey show that almost all AGs in the sample (N=1306) have attended school; however, only about three-quarters were enrolled in school at the time of the survey. Results further indicate that the largest percentage enrollment drops occur between the ages of 12 and 13 and the ages of 14 and 15, which appear to be times of transition between schools.  Additionally, about 4%(n=53) of the sample of AGs is married and 1.5% (n=20) has children, with 51% (n=27) and 65% (n=13) of these AGs, respectively, being 16 years old. In the endline survey, a total of 996 household surveys and 1,018 girl surveys were completed. While we are still in the process of finalizing the analysis, we hope to see that enrolled AGs will mainly gain knowledge and skills to increase their autonomy, self-esteem, and self-efficacy to delay pregnancy, avoid an unintended pregnancy, and remain in or return to school. However, as the study still has a short period of observation and a small sample size, a limited effect is expected on the latter indicators during this pilot phase of the project.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The AF program is evidence-based allowing for replicability and scale-up. AF is constructed on the knowledge that young adolescent girls are agents of social change and strategic investments in them directly support the achievement of local, state, and national development goals. As expected results from this intervention that we will assess at the end of the program implementation, we hope to document that enrolled AGs will gain autonomy, self-esteem, and self-efficacy to delay and/or avoid an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, and remain in or return to school. The AF program uses a cascading leadership approach, wherein young females are trained to become leaders and guide other girls in the community. The nature of this approach in all girl programs implemented by PC and the compilation of a specific program guide and tool-kit for Yucatan provide trained human and technical resources for community-led implementation in the future. While there are significant costs in the initial adaptation, design, and development of materials, piloting, etc., operating the programs locally once initiated will be a very low cost enterprise.  To make replication easy we are developing a detailed step-by-step guide, specifically adapted to the cultural context of Yucatan, but also useful in low-income regions of other Latin American countries.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Advances in family planning (FP) have focused largely on increasing the availability of services and expanding accessibility for women. But decisions about if, when, and how often to reproduce or follow through on a chosen FP method is intrinsically tied to gender norms and attitudes that influence client’s behavior. Likewise, FP providers operate with their own gender biases and perceptions. Each health care worker brings his/her social, religious, and cultural beliefs, and biases based on previous experiences, personal views, attitudes and power in relation to others. Provider biases influence reproductive health (RH) services and may lead to inequitable health outcomes for clients. For example, FP providers may reinforce inequitable gender norms by restricting long-acting methods until a woman has had a child.  </p><p>Improving health workers’ understanding of gender can help women, men, girls, and boys to exercise their right to choose if and when they desire to have children, and how many. \"Gender-competent” FP providers can: reflect on their own gender norms, biases and power; create opportunities for increasing voluntary and informed choice as well as correct and continued use of FP methods; improve quality of care; meet their clients’ RH needs, contributing to greater gender equality and reproductive empowerment.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Human Resources for Health in 2030 (HRH2030) Program in collaboration with USAID’s Office of Population and Reproductive Health developed a Gender Competency Framework for FP Service Providers, which delineates the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to provide gender equitable services that allow individuals to realize their reproductive rights. The Gender Competency Framework and accompanying technical brief explain the significance of having gender-competent FP providers in meeting clients’ reproductive intentions, including a theory of change, operating principles or domains, an extensive explanation and glossary of terms, and a comprehensive list of the specific gender competencies for FP providers. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2017, HRH2030 developed Gender Competency Framework for FP Providers through: a desktop review of relevant published and grey literature; an in-person consultative forum of gender, family-planning, gender-based violence, and human resources for health experts and practicing FP providers; and a virtual call for comments on the updated work to provide opportunity for input from global specialists. After each step, HRH2030 revised and refined the framework and technical brief. </p><p> </p><p>In 2018, HRH2030 is conducting field validation in two countries with the Gender Competency Framework for FP Providers to ascertain if the framework is logical and understandable, solicit feedback on applicability and examples of contextual adaptations, and develop a greater understanding of the potential gender competency gaps by domain and competency in the country context. Field validation will be completed through key informant interviews with central-level stakeholders including pre-service education trainers and curriculum developers, national program leaders, implementing partners, associations and licensing bodies, central Ministry of Health policy drivers, FP and gender champions, as well as facilitated in depth interviews conversations with FP providers in facilities as an assessment of the competency framework. </p><p> </p><p>Results of the field validation will be complete for dissemination by November 2018. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A “gender-competent FP provider” is a health worker with the capacity to identify how different norms, social constructs, roles, expectations, and power differentials assigned to women, men, girls, and boys influence RH behavior and choices. In addition, the provider is aware of how his or her perception and treatment of male or female individuals influence clients’ voluntary and informed FP decision-making. A gender-competent FP provider strives to apply the needed knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create equitable opportunities for women, men, girls, and boys to make voluntary and informed RH/FP decisions based on their needs, across six domain areas. The domains are: using gender-sensitive communication, promoting individual agency, supporting legal rights and status, engaging men and boys as partners as users, facilitating positive couples’ communication and cooperative decision-making, and addressing gender-based violence (GBV). </p><p> </p><p>Within each domain are specific competencies, or knowledge, skills, and attitudes, to demonstrate gender-competence. For example, under gender-sensitive communication, a provider should be aware of the power imbalance that may exist as a result of gender, culture, education, or other differences and can impact access to information and services. Likewise, under the domain addressing GBV, a provider should know and understand the facility protocol for managing GBV, including referral for support services, reporting requirements, and if the facility meets the minimum conditions for GBV screening.</p><p> </p><p>Country validation will polish Gender Competency Framework for FP Providers and provide vignettes or contextualized examples of how to demonstrate each competency to enable operationalization development into a pre-service education training package. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Gender competence can expand providers’ ability to deliver better services and create opportunities to increase informed and voluntary choice of FP methods and reproductive empowerment, contributing to improved RH and gender equality. By advancing a provider’s knowledge, skills, and attitudes about gender in the context of FP, s/he will be more likely to: identify how gender norms and biases for women, men, girls, and boys influence RH behavior; seek ways to address gender norms and biases; respond to the diverse needs of all clients; and promote free and informed client choice. With increased gender competence, FP providers will deliver high-quality FP services and contribute to more gender-equitable FP service access. With more equitable and high-quality FP services, a greater number of individuals, couples, families, and communities can realize their right to RH. By enabling reproductive empowerment, the provider can contribute to improved RH and gender equality. </p><p> </p><p>Filtering general client interactions, communication, counseling, and delivery of FP services through a gender lens enables health workers to more adequately and effectively meet clients’ RH needs through quality services under a rights-based approach. The rights-based approach to FP refers to fulfilling an individual’s right to choose whether, when, and how many children to have, to act on those choices, and to access those services free from discrimination, coercion, and violence. Ultimately, increasing gender competence will contribute to sustainable transformations in perception of gender norms and recognition of power differentials in client-to-client relationships and client-provider interaction and contribute to improved RH outcomes.</p>",

      "title": "The Gender Transformative Approach in SRHR: inspiring cases of Pakistan",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Harmful gender norms continue to affect Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). Rutgers addresses these negative norms, trying to transform them into positive ones, in several international SRHR programs: the ‘Get Up Speak Out’ program (GUSO 2016-2020) and Prevention+ (2016-2020), by developing and applying a toolkit on Gender Transformative Approaches (GTA). Existing evidence shows that better outcomes are achieved when doing so, for example, Doyle et.al. (2018) reveal that targeted, gender-transformative programming on health and violence leads to: - 40% less violence against a partner; - Greater contraceptive use: 70% of women in the MenCare program vs. 61% in the comparison group report currently using modern contraception; and - Greater involvement of women in decision-making in the household: 56% of women in the MenCare program say that the man has the final say about the use of weekly/monthly income and expenses vs. 79% who say so in the comparison group, a difference of about 30%.</p><p></p><p>We would like to present Rutgers newly developed toolkit on GTA and its use by presenting some best practices from Pakistan, where the GUSO and Prevention+ programs are being implemented by our country office and several local counterparts.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Rutgers has been applying and practicing the toolkit on GTA in Pakistan, using the modality of Trainings of Trainers (ToT), to build a group of GTA master trainers. The toolkit provides a set of training tools based on experiential learning principles about key themes like the rights based approach, power, harmful gender and sexual norms, gender and sexual diversity the empowerment of women/girls and the engagement of men/boys. Once trained the master trainers cascaded their knowledge down to key staff members of i.a. the government’s social welfare and education departments, the women development directorate and religious leaders.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>From May to July 2017 a series of ToTs were organised. During the rest of the year these trainers worked with the already mentioned <strong>governmental departments,</strong> with the aim to strengthen them regarding their capacity on SRHR with a gender transformative approach and to <strong>create an enabling environment for the prevention of gender-based violence</strong>. Before the trainings were conducted, a <strong>training needs analysis</strong> was done to gauge the knowledge and capacity of the staff for designing and implementing a program on the prevention of gender based and sexual violence.</p><p>With the other target group, <strong>religious leaders</strong>, a <strong>series of discussion sessions</strong> were organized at national, provincial and district level about SRHR, Child Marriages and prevention of GBV. Afterwards renowned religious scholars represented at the Council of Islamic Ideology agreed to discuss the child marriages laws and consider not opposing their revision. In this process they had a consultative discussion with adolescent boys and girls (Kirans) and discussed the issue and at community level the support was provided to GBV campaign.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "The group of GTA master trainers was launched and is receiving recognition in the SRHR sector. Gender Transformative Approaches have been very motivating, are being considered as importantand have now been integrated into the social welfare training institution’s curriculum. The institutions agreed to integrate GTA related concepts in to their routine practice. This involves arrangements like supporting any initiative for paternity leave, the formulation of a sexual harassment policy, provide day care facilities and flexibility to feeding mothersand pregnant women. In practice, however, these measures require a lot of efforts and advocacy,because it are centralized policy matters.Twenty five religious leaders were provided with orientations about GTA and SRHR rights. These leaders are now raising awareness  about GBV and specifically women and girl’s rights in their religious teachings  in the targeted districts. They address the importance of these topics in the context of the Islam during Friday sermons. The consultation of the council of Islamic ideology scholars with adolescent boys and girls was first of its kind. Within the targeted districts the SRH and practices of final beneficiaries improved and gender-based violence reduced. Coordination mechanisms between the relevant departments were developed and the district coordination committees were made functional. Rutgers’ technical support and training on GTA strengthens the capacities of district governments and stakeholders to develop and plan preventive measures, and improving GBV response mechanisms.",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Gender Transformative Approaches are relatively new and the level of understanding in the context of SHRH programs is still quite low. <strong>Partners require more technical assistance and GTA guidelines/tools.</strong> For example, during program implementation it was observed that program participants hesitated to talk about SRHR issues of women, which is considered to be shameful. To address the barriers we adapted our educational materials, taking into consideration the cultural context of Pakistan, i.e. we changed the name ‘Comprehensive Sexuality Education’ into ‘Life Skills Based Education’, and Sexual Right are addressed under the themes of Reproductive Health &amp; Rights of men &amp; boys and women and girl. Sexual violence was discussed under the topic of Gender Based Violence. In addition, it was necessary to create <strong>safe spaces for women and girls and men and boys</strong>, including <strong>development practitioners</strong>, to discuss critical and sensitive topics openly. After developing the capacity of pubic departments the institutionalization still requires a lot of efforts for policy change. In 2018/19 Rutgers will continue the development of GTA guidelines and tools in consultation with the relevant institutions.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Sexual and gender minorities are an often overlooked and underserved demographic with regards to information dissemination of family planning methods. Inconsistent use of contraceptive methods during sexual activity puts sexually active people at risk of sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies. The same is true for Kenyan sexual and gender minorities (Zaidi, Ocholla, Otieno, &amp; Sandfort, 2016), who may be at an even higher risk than their heterosexual, cisgender counterparts. An Australian study found that women having sex with women (WSW) had significantly more previous male sex partners than heterosexual-identifying women did. WSWs also had a higher number of sexual interactions with gay-identifying men and intravenous drug users. Sex work was also found to be more prevalent among WSW (Fethers, Marks, Mindel &amp; Estcourt, 2000). In men having sex with men, despite this elevated risk, targeted prevention programs to reduce HIV/AIDS risk and increase condom use for this group are largely non-existent in the US (CDC, 2013).There are many barriers to sexual and gender minority people receiving appropriate care, especially in countries with a restrictive legal setting, such as Kenya. Barriers include internalised and structural homophobia, stigma, discrimination, and a lack of knowledge on inclusive services by healthcare providers. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Love Matters Africa is an online project aiming to provide open, honest, and sex-friendly information to youth. In March 2018, our English-speaking regional platforms reached over 150.000 visitors a month, while our social media pages had over 1.3 million followers. Under an Amplify Change grant, we are further developing our content to meet the unique needs of minorities even more effectively. From the outcomes of our desk research, we understand that to mitigate risk factors amongst this demographic, we need to focus on the risks associated with behaviour rather than the perceived activities related to sexual orientation</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Addressing sexual and gender minorities digitally seems a logical approach to circumvent many of the barriers that affect affective information dissemination on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) topics in this particular demographic.  To bridge the gap in information provision on family planning for sexual and gender minorities, we updated our existing family planning information on the website to ensure inclusiveness for sexual and gender minority people. Secondly, we added a separate section specifically outlining the risks for sexual and gender minorities and how to mitigate them. The resource is phrased from a pleasure-focused angle (I.e. 'using lubricant for anal intercourse will enhance your pleasure while reducing your risk of getting infected with an STI').</p><p>Then, those resources were tested in focus group discussions (FGDs) with Kenyan sexual and gender minority people to firstly assess their effectiveness and whether the information needs are met. Secondly, experiences with service delivery with regards to family planning provision were discussed in the FGDs to identify more gaps and needs. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The processes and data collection are on-going, with the results being presented exclusively at the International Conference on Family Planning Conference. We know that disseminating SRHR information for sexual and gender minority people through innovative ways will be very valuable and worth discussing during the conference.   We propose to present the newly adjusted resources, discuss why we focused on behaviours as opposed to identity and orientation and why they were phrased in a pleasure-friendly way. We will present data of the resources' utilisation post-launch, including user comments and feedback.  Secondly, the outcomes of FGDs of sexual and gender minority people from Kenya will be presented, to share their thoughts about the updated, inclusive resource, barriers they face with service provision, and their input on ways to improve service provision with regards to contraception for sexual and gender minorities in Kenya.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Our experience is that providing honest and non-judgemental information on SRHR makes our audience trust us as a high-quality source of information. We know that by providing crucial SRHR information digitally, we are able to circumnavigate barriers and gatekeepers, such as religious institutions. This is especially important for populations that are misunderstood and underserved by traditional healthcare interventions. As Kenyan sexual and gender minorities are less likely to disclose their gender identity and sexual orientation to healthcare providers for fear of stigma and discrimination (Minority Women in Action, 2013), they are unlikely to get all the information they need to make healthy decisions regarding their sexual behaviour.  While we are, of course, aware that knowledge is only the first step in behavioural change, providing information to demographics for whom it is difficult to access high-quality information, is crucial.  </p><p>Additionally, having a better insight about what sexual and gender minorities require might make it easier for healthcare professionals to service is overlooked demographic.  With the outcomes of the FGDs and our experience from information provision, we hope to increase awareness of the needs and gaps in family planning provision for sexual and gender minorities in Kenya. </p>",

      "title": "Évaluation de la qualité de service de PF du réseau de franchise sociale « BelFam » mise en œuvre par l’Agence Ivoirienne de Marketing Social (AIMAS)",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Selon les résultats de l’enquête Démographique et de Santé (EDS 2012), l’utilisation de méthodes contraceptives modernes par les femmes en âge de procréer est de seulement 13,9%, alors que les besoins non satisfaits en matière de planification familiale (PF) de ces femmes s’élève à 27,1%. Au cours des 5 dernières années, environ 24% des naissances (y compris la dernière grossesse) étaient voulues plus tard ou non désirées. Dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre de la phase IV du programme « planification familiale et prévention du VIH/sida », un réseau de Franchise Sociale (FS) a été mis en place en collaboration avec le Programme National de la Santé Mère Enfant (PNSME) pour l’offre de services de Planification Familiale (PF). Ce réseau de FS, appelé « réseau de franchise sociale BelFam », est composé de structures publiques et privées et a pour but d’améliorer la qualité et l'accès aux services de PF de qualité. Il permet d’élargir la gamme de produits contraceptifs offerte par l’AIMAS aux méthodes de longue durée, notamment au DIU. La phase pilote de ce projet de réseau de Franchise Sociale financé par la KFW, couvrent les districts sanitaires de Abobo Est, Abobo Ouest, Koumassi-Port-Bouët-Vridi et Anyama. Afin d’évaluer la qualité des services de PF délivrée dans les centres membres du réseau de Franchise Sociale en vue d’améliorer continuellement la qualité de service offerte, une étude a été mise en œuvre. Cette présentation analyse les résultats cette l’évaluation de la qualité de service du réseau.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>L’objectif général de cette étude est d’appréhender le niveau de la qualité de service de PF délivrée dans du réseau de franchise sociale. Ce qui devra permettre d’en détecter le dysfonctionnement et/ou les bonnes pratiques dans le but final d’améliorer les performances de ces centres. De manière spécifique l’étude a permis de (i) Apprécier la qualité de service des aspects techniques de l’offre de soin de PF du prestataire (libre choix de la méthode, information sur la méthode, information sur les effets secondaires et la conduite à tenir, courtoisie et respect etc.) ; (ii) Apprécier la qualité de service relative aux aspects organisationnels de l’établissement (temps d’attente, perception de la propreté, des commodités de salle de consultation etc.) ; (iii) Déterminer la satisfaction globale du patient relative au service reçu</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Une approche quantitative a été employée pour cette étude. Les données ont été collectées auprès des femmes en âge de procréer de 15-49 ans, fréquentant les centres de santé du réseau de franchise sociale BelFam pour une consultation ou des demandes d’informations au service de planification familiale. Au total un échantillon de 620 femmes a été interrogé. Cette taille est suffisante pour mesurer statistiquement les principaux indicateurs avec un seuil de confiance de 95% et une marge d’erreur de 5%. La collecte des données s’est déroulée en 2017 dans 20 centres de santé du réseau BelFam des districts sanitaires de Abobo Est, Abobo Ouest, Koumassi-Port-Bouët-Vridi et Anyama. Les données ont été collectées par le cabinet REWA.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Du point de vue organisationnel, la majorité (97,7%) des femmes affirment être satisfaites de l’accueil réservé à la clientèle dans les services de PF. Près de 9 femmes sur 10 estiment que la confidentialité pendant l’entretien avec le prestataire est respectée (89,7% échange secret/totalement secret). Il en est de même pour la préservation de l’intimité pendant la prestation (88,5% satisfait/totalement satisfaite). Quant à la propreté de l’établissement, elle est fortement appréciée (94,3% satisfait/totalement satisfaite). La durée de prestation de service est jugée convenable (77,3%) de même que le temps d’attente qu’il faut (82,9% convenable). Du point de vue technique, la courtoisie et le respect du prestataire à l’endroit des clientes ressortent comme le premier facteur de satisfaction des femmes (98,7% satisfaites). Concernant le respect du libre choix de la méthode, une proportion élevée de femmes a affirmé qu’elle a choisi sa méthode elle-même (95,9%) tandis 80% des femmes ont reçu l’information sur les autres méthodes contraceptives. La majorité des femmes a été invitée à prendre des RDVs pour des visites de contrôle et/ou renouvellement des médicaments (95,1%). En revanche, seulement le tiers (34%) des femmes déclare avoir reçu l’information sur les effets secondaires et un peu moins de la moitié (42%) déclare n’avoir pas reçu d’information sur l’attitude à adopter en cas d’effets secondaires. Les femmes sont peu informées sur les signes d’alerte (52,1%). Aussi une grande dispersion est relevée au niveau des prix pratiqués pour le service de PF reçu lors de la première visite dans le centre.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Les résultats de l’évaluation ont permis d’appréhender la satisfaction de la clientèle du réseau de franchise sociale d’une manière générale. Elle a toutefois fourni des arguments, à travers les quelques insuffisances relevées, pour améliorer continuellement la qualité de service de PF. Ainsi une attention particulière devra être portée sur le renforcement continue des capacités des prestataires de PF pour, pour maintenir voire améliorer le niveau élevé de satisfaction globale. Cela passera nécessairement par une réduction du temps d’attente, une meilleure information sur les effets secondaires et la conduite à tenir en cas d’apparition, l’information sur les autres méthodes existantes, les signes d’alerte liés à l’utilisation des méthodes contraceptives ainsi qu’une harmonisation des coûts des services dans le réseau BelFam.</p>",

      "title": "How can we ensure we are listening to our clients? Lessons from Marie Stopes Tanzania's Clients Advisory Board",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Marie Stopes Tanzania (MST) is a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service delivery organization that is part of Marie Stopes International (MSI).  All MSI staff members strive to put client care at the heart of everything we do.  MSI feels that our clients are in the best position to tell us about our services.  Receiving and acting on client feedback is central to improving the quality of client care and ensuring that the client experience remains central to everything we do.  MSI has developed several mechanisms to support this, including feedback forms, an annual client feedback survey, mood meter boxes, and more.  In addition to these tools, MST is pioneering the use of a client advisory board, called the ‘Client Advisory Committee’ (CAC), to facilitate a participatory monitoring and accountability approach to collecting client feedback and ultimately improving quality of SRH service delivery.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "\t<li><strong>Program intervention/ Activity tested </strong></li><p></p><p>The CAC is a group of previous MST clients who are between 18-49 years old.  The CAC seeks to address quality of care provided by MST to clients by integrating client perspectives into programming. The CAC members, through interactions with current MST clients, assess quality of care provided at MST’s 11 centres, and advise on specific feedback and subsequent service improvement, helping MST understand:  1.) what quality services mean to different clients; 2.) how high quality services can be defined and identified and 3.) how MST can ensure they are being delivered.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The CAC began as a 2-year (2014-2015) pilot project in three MST facilities-- Mwenge, Temeke and Arusha centres. Learning from the pilot results were used to adjust the CAC model, and it was scaled-up at the end of 2016 across all MST health facilities (N=11), which operate both in urban and pre-urban areas in the Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Mbeya, Musoma, Kahama, Iringa, Mbeya and Zanzibar regions of Tanzania.</p><p>Ten CAC members are assigned to each MST facility, so there are 110 CAC members in total. Every CAC member works 2 days per month to collect client feedback by conducting face-to-face interviews with clients and do observations on how services are being delivered. Then all CAC members meet at MST facilities one day each month to provide immediate feedback to facility in-charges.  </p><p>CAC members conduct face-to-face interviews with about 300 clients per month.  Semi-structured questionnaires are used and occasionally updated based on CAC feedback. The elements of the semi-structured questionnaire that are covered include clinic environment, provider’s attitudes, quality of FP and PAC service provision and client satisfaction.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The CAC interviewed a total of N=1,090 MST clients from May 2017 to November 2017 across all 11 MST facilities. Among them 73% (n= 796) were females and 27% males (n=295); 73% (n=796) were 25 years or older. From August to December 2016, the CAC interviewed a total of 144 clients in 5 centres. Most clients 78% (n=109) were female, 22% (n=32) were male, and 81% (n=117) were 25 years or older.</p><p></p><p>Overall results in 2017 show high and improved or sustained satisfaction compared to 2016. In 2017 results show 99% of clients were satisfied with their overall experience compared to 97% in 2016.In 2017, 100% of clients reported that they were satisfied with cleanliness of the facilities compared to 87% in 2016. In 2017, 99% reported high levels of privacy compared to 93% in 2016. In 2017, 99% were satisfied with MST opening hours compared to 87% in 2016.  In 2017, 98% reported they received the right amount of information on follow-up care.</p><p></p><p>CAC reported that some clients in Temeke and Zanzibar requested ultra sound services. Thus, in September 2017 ultra sound services were introduced. The CAC also advised MST on issues such as facility opening times and cleanliness. The CAC also recommended basic mosquito fumigation in certain facilities, to improve clinic environment. The CAC also advised MST on issues such as adding water dispensers to clinic waiting areas, And suggested each centre have an outdoor sign post.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The MST CAC has contributed to a significant improvement in quality of SRH services across MST centres.  Through CAC, MST management, operational teams and service providers are better able to understand barriers and challenges to clients during service provision that were previously not understood. The CAC holds MST staff accountable for understanding and reacting to client viewpoints and enables effective communication with clients. Generally, involving clients in planning, taking or identifying corrective actions in the health care system embodies a collaborative client-provider relationship, and supports service providers to transform their culture and behaviour and to promote client- centred care.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Quality is a multi-factorial and multi-dimensional concept, highly context-dependent and often subjective. This complexity has presented a measurement challenge to family planning (FP) researchers and program evaluators for decades. Yet despite this complexity, effective measurement of FP quality is essential to monitor progress and ensure that women are able to realize their contraceptive and fertility desires.</p><p>Despite near unanimous agreement on the importance of quality, much of the research looking at FP quality has focused on its effect on process outcomes such as utilization.  A great deal of FP quality research asserts the importance of rights and autonomy, but very few quality measures have looked at the impact of quality on rights-based outcomes, focusing instead on contraceptive uptake and prevalence. Working within the logic that the ultimate goal of family planning programs is not simply to increase contraceptive uptake, but rather, to help women achieve the childbearing they desire on their own timeline, we seek to explore the relationship between the quality of family planning counseling, women's desires, and their reproductive health/fertility outcomes, within the context of a large-scale postpartum IUD (PPIUD) intervention.  </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Does quality of family planning counseling affect not only women's uptake of contraception, but their ability to achieve their fertility desires?  More specifically, within the 2 years after an index birth, does high-quality FP counseling help women who want to postpone/limit childbearing do so, while also helping women who seek another pregnancy to have one?</p><p>We hypothesize that, given higher quality of care, women will be more able to achieve their fertility desires – that is, have a child if they want one, or postpone/limit childbearing if they seek to do so. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A step-wedge cluster-randomized study to evaluate a PPIUD intervention was conducted among women giving birth in 17 tertiary hospitals in Sri Lanka, Nepal and Tanzania. Longitudinal data collection following over 146,988 women began in 2015 and is ongoing through 2018.</p><p>We created a multidimensional \"counseling quality index\" for each woman based on self-reported information on family planning counseling received during antenatal and delivery care.  The index includes information on the number and type of methods upon which the woman was counseled, the number of counseling interactions, and the ability of the women to interact with and ask questions of the FP counselor.  This  index is then transformed into a binary variable of what we consider “minimally adequate counseling”.</p><p>Using preliminary data, we compared women's postpartum reproductive desires for limiting, spacing, or childbearing at baseline with their outcomes at 9 and 18 months and defined this concept as \"FP concordance\" -- that is, concordance between the woman’s fertility desires and her fertility outcomes.  We then used multiple logistic regression to assess correlation between this and the counseling quality index, controlling for age, education and country as potential confounders.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In pooled data for all three countries, only 35% of women received minimally adequate counseling, with considerable variation by country: 12.2% for women in Nepal, 31.6% for women in Tanzania, and 80.9% for women in Sri Lanka.   In all three countries, at least half of women were allowed to ask questions.  However, greater variability was found across countries on other elements of FP counseling quality. For example, in Sri Lanka, almost 50% of women were counseled on a range of methods, while in Nepal, fewer than 10% were.  Descriptive statistics for our sample are shown here in Table 1.  </p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTanzania \t\t\t\t\t\tNepal\t\t\t\t\t\tSri Lanka\t\t\t\t\t\tn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAge (by %)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t18-25\t\t\t\t\t\t41.2%\t\t\t\t\t\t66.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t33.3%\t\t\t\t\t\t76,543\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t25-49\t\t\t\t\t\t58.8%\t\t\t\t\t\t34.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t66.7%\t\t\t\t\t\t70,445\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t100.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t100.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t100.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t146,988\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation (by %) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNone\t\t\t\t\t\t1.3%\t\t\t\t\t\t8.1%\t\t\t\t\t\t0.6%\t\t\t\t\t\t6,677\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrimary\t\t\t\t\t\t51.9%\t\t\t\t\t\t11.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t3.6%\t\t\t\t\t\t21,984\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecondary\t\t\t\t\t\t32.8%\t\t\t\t\t\t46.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t45.2%\t\t\t\t\t\t60,754\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t &gt; Secondary\t\t\t\t\t\t14.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t34.9%\t\t\t\t\t\t50.6%\t\t\t\t\t\t50,147\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t100.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t100.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t100.0%\t\t\t\t\t\t139,562\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuality Indicators (by %) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllowed questions\t\t\t\t\t\t51.2%\t\t\t\t\t\t50.2%\t\t\t\t\t\t58.5%\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCounseled twice + \t\t\t\t\t\t72.4%\t\t\t\t\t\t26.7%\t\t\t\t\t\t91.1%\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCounseled on range\t\t\t\t\t\t14.6%\t\t\t\t\t\t9%\t\t\t\t\t\t49.7%\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Multiple logistic regression results are showed here in Table 2.  Several variables were statistically significantly correlated with higher odds of FP concordance, including age, educational attainment, and country.  Most notably, women who received minimally adequate counseling at 1.33 times the odds of realizing their fertility desires within 18 months, compared to women who received a poorer standard of counseling. </p>\tTable 2: Multiple Logistic Regression Results\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOdds Ratio\t\t\t\t\t\tStandard     Error\t\t\t\t\t\tP&gt;z\t\t\t\t\t\t[95% Conf.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Kenya health commodities strategic plan identifies distribution and capacity strengthening as key investment areas to avert and reduce stock outs. John Snow Inc (JSI) carried out an assessment of supply chain management in Kenya in 2016. Gaps such as stock-outs, weak forecasting and quantification, poor data reporting, leakage of family planning (FP) products, non-uniform FP ordering and delivery process, and inefficient distribution and transportation were identified. To address some of the gaps, Health Strat was engaged to provide capacity strengthening in commodity management and affiliated reporting with an ultimate aim of reducing stock-outs. Support supervision, a key tool in forestalling some of the issues in supply chain management was selected as one key intervention in the capacity strengthening effort.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Most health programs in Kenya have supportive supervision tools to track implementation and quality of care. For the RH program however, the tool was not standardized hence there were varied approaches to supervision by different managers that may have affected the quality of support to facilities resulting in commodity stock-outs. Interventions by Health Strat included standardization of the support supervision tool, training of commodity managers and oversight of the supervision exercise.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The support supervision tool was loaded onto Qualicare® which is housed on an open source mobile data collection platform that allows real time data transmission from the interviews to a secure server. The system has a GPS tracker that ensures that data can only be collected at a specific site. The system works both on an online and offline mode allowing data collection in remote areas with limited internet access. A validation check was also programmed in the software to prevent an interviewer from moving on to the next question before answering the previous one. Data entered in the software was uploaded to a central server from where it was exported to a spreadsheet for verification and analysis. Following development of the supportive supervision tool, commodity managers from six counties and their 47 sub counties were oriented on the tool. Supportive supervision was undertaken where health workers were interviewed and observations made on the state of storage of FP commodities. Stock counts were done and records reviewed. Based on the supervision findings, the facilities were scored. All desirable answers scored a “one” while undesirable ones earned a score of “zero” in the specific supply chain area.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 787 facilities were visited during the support supervision exercise in the six selected counties. The digitized version of the tool was easy to use after two hours of training. The supervision process was guided as the user was prompted on which questions to ask at each point in time. The inbuilt data quality checks on the tool resulted in collection of complete supervision data in all cases. From this data, various commodity management indicators were analyzed including tool availability and accuracy of reporting where both the commodity form and service data registers were both available in 94% of the facilities visited. With regard to accuracy and completeness of reporting, a total of 90% of health facilities were recorded to fill the DAR on a daily basis. However, it was established that only 63% of facilities had sufficient storage. On overall individual facility performance on all scored areas, the average stood at 54%, with a maximum score at 97% and the minimum score was 15%.The standardization provided uniformity across all facilities. In addition, further analysis of the data by county, sub-county and by the level of facility was undertaken enabling the RH managers to develop dashboards. This enabled the managers to group their facilities by need as per their performance in the various indicators and offer targeted technical support.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>In conclusion, standardization of support supervision ensures that all areas of commodity management are assessed providing a platform for improvements. Introduction of scores also allows for tracking of improvements and instills a sense of accountability among health workers. The supportive supervision exercise as implemented by Health Strat showed that real time data availability as availed using the Qualicare ® system helped in speeding up decisions at the facility level to avert and reduce future stock-outs. Findings from the exercise also point to the relevance of training health workers on how to correctly use the standard reporting tools on commodity data. It was also found that storage space in Counties needs expansion in order to ensure orderliness and reduce damage and expiries that could occur due to overcrowding of stock.</p>",

The increase in institutional deliveries to 78.9% and the availability of safe and effective postpartum IUCD insertion since 2008 provided the opportunity to make postpartum IUCD insertions available and address low FP use (26%) among postpartum women.</p><p>With an increase in the number of insertions, ensuring the quality of IUCD services became even more important; this depends on the skills of service providers to provide clinical and counseling services in compliance with recognized standards, create a supportive environment, meet clients’ needs to their satisfaction, and conduct clinical follow-up.</p><p>Such follow-ups are critical to assessing women’s overall satisfaction with the method and to identify and manage potential and existing problems, such as perforation, irregular bleeding, missing strings, infection, pregnancy, expulsions, and discontinuations—together, a reflection of service quality. The reported incidences of complications are: missing strings, 2–8%; infection, 1.6 per 1,000 women/years; and first-year expulsion, 2–10%. These three complications were considered a proxy indicator for assessment of quality of services in this study.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The hypothesis is that in cases where quality of IUCD services is not maintained, clients returning after insertion would have a higher incidence of expulsion, gynecologic infections, or missing strings. The main research question explored was: Does training on IUCD insertion by the Expanding Access to IUCD Services in India (EAISI) project reduce complications? The magnitude of complications and the factors associated with complications were also explored. The study also addressed whether recorded complications were comparable to the reported incidence in other studies.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>EngenderHealth, through its EAISI project, is providing technical assistance to the health systems in selected subdistrict facilities of Rajasthan and Gujarat to expand the availability of quality IUCD services. The interventions included building the capacity of service providers, monitoring their compliance with standard practices, and strengthening systems. Data for the interventions were recorded in process documents, monitoring reports, and follow-up registers at the facilities. This abstract is based on a secondary analysis of the data captured in the follow-up registers. A universal sampling was done of the data of clients returning to facilities for follow-up from December 2015 to November 2016. Data from telephone follow-ups or home-visits were excluded. The complications included in the analysis were- expulsion, infection, or missing strings. The data were analyzed using SPSS 24. As period of insertion and training status of providers have been reported to be associated with complications, a bivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain their effect on the likelihood of having complications. The caveats of the analysis framework were that the data was secondary; the completeness of data could not be ensured; and the number of follow-ups documented were very less.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 58,145 insertions were done in 180 intervention facilities, but total follow-ups recorded were 5,857 from 142 facilities (Gujarat: 28; Rajasthan: 114) where follow-up registers were available. Among the clients followed up, 4,246 (72.5%) insertions were by the EAISI-trained providers, while 1,611 (27.5%) were by the providers who were either untrained or trained by other agencies. Among these clients, 4,567 (78%) insertions were post-placental, 686 (11.7%) immediate postpartum, 300 (5.1%) intra-caesarean, 269 (4.6%) interval IUCD insertions, and 35 (0.6%) unspecified.</p><p>A total of 234 (4%) clients reported complications. Expulsion was reported by 118 (2%), missing strings by 85 (1.5%), and infection by 31 (0.5%) clients, which is comparable to other studies. Expulsion was most common complication in insertions by EAISI-trained providers, while missing strings was most common complication in insertions by other providers.</p><p>Logistic regression showed that EAISI training had a statistically significant effect on reducing complications (χ2 = 24.75, p2) of the variance in complications and correctly classified 96% of cases. Insertions done by EAISI-trained providers were 1.3 times [95% CI (1.007, 1.858)] less likely to end up in a complication than were insertions done by other providers. The period of insertion (i.e., post-placental, postpartum within 48 hours, and interval) was associated in inverse order of significance with the occurrence of complications, but age was not associated significantly.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Studies report that with good technique, expulsion rates can be reduced to under 3%. The low expulsion rate in this study suggests good clinical skills of the providers. Logistic regression confirms the role of intensive, hands-on training and follow-up of providers under EAISI that built up their clinical skills to provide quality services and reduce post-insertion complications. Based on this, the EAISI model can be used to scale up trainings to other geographic areas, by government or other partners.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The follow-up registers were not available at all places, and the long-term expulsion rates could not be determined, as the vast majority of clients had follow-up within 4–6 weeks. Nevertheless, the study creates grounds for further research and presents a feasible model for periodic assessment of the quality of IUCD services in FP programs.</p>",

      "title": "A deep dive into side effects and their role in method continuation: A longitudinal study of LARC users in Senegal",
      "significanceBackground": "<p><strong>Significance</strong>: Long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARCs) including subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) have begun to show their potential to radically change voluntary family planning (FP) in Africa. LARCs have taken on greater importance in the contraceptive method mix in many countries, with implants in particular seeing marked increases in users. While failure rates of LARCs are low, discontinuation is an important concern that can leave women vulnerable to pregnancy if they do not adopt another method. Effectively meeting the current (and increasing) demand for LARCs requires responsive and effective strategies to ensure expanded access as part of a broad method mix that also includes related services such as follow-up, management of side effects and removals. There is a dearth of information--from the client’s point of view—on how to help women effectively manage side effects associated with LARCs and on how service delivery factors may affect a decision to continue or discontinue the method. Other social, cultural, and attitudinal factors that influence experiences with side effects also warrant attention. Enhanced understanding of these factors and their interplay is important, as it could improve LARC continuation and inform guidelines and approaches to routine service delivery for implant and IUD acceptors.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p><strong>Main question</strong>: The key objective of this longitudinal study was to understand the factors, including side effects, associated with LARC uptake and continuation/discontinuation in the first twelve months of use. The expectation is that 1) recording the experiences of women who accepted an implant or IUD several times over a 12-month period, and 2) conducting in-depth interviews with a subset who reported experiencing side effects will reveal concrete steps to improve LARC services, and consequently, LARC continuation rates.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: We conducted a mixed-method longitudinal study in four regions in Senegal: Dakar, Thiès, Kaffrine and Diourbel. The quantitative component consisted of surveys of LARC acceptors, initially recruited and interviewed at 30 service delivery sites (baseline), then re-interviewed via phone or face-to-face at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months (4 follow-ups) after accepting an implant or an IUD. LARC acceptors were recruited over a two-month period from mobile outreach services, public clinics and social franchise facilities in the four study regions. They were followed in staggered fashion over the four designated follow-up intervals.</p><p>Cognitive interviews with current and previous LARC users served to refine and finalize the baseline and follow-up survey instruments before they were deployed in the field. Mid-term in-depth interviews (IDIs), the other qualitative component of the study, were conducted at the six-month follow-up point with a subset of survey participants who reported experiences with side effects. We estimated that a sample size of 1,445 LARC acceptors would be sufficient to detect a 6% difference in the rate of discontinuation due to side effects reported by women who received an IUD or an implant.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Results/key findings</strong>: Preliminary results from baseline surveys indicated that LARC clients were in their late 20s and early 30s. Over 95% of them were married or cohabitating and almost all had at least one child. The most reported reasons for choosing a long-acting method were wanting a highly effective method and wanting it to last a long time. IUD acceptors had used more modern contraceptive methods in the past than implant users, but both had previously used the injectable more than any other modern method. Most IUD (93%) and implant users (86%) reported being counseled on different family planning methods. Of those who reported being counseled, the information they were given most frequently was on heavy bleeding or bleeding problems. At baseline, over 96% of women said they would return to the health provider for help if they experienced a side effect in the future. Very few women said they would do nothing, try to manage it on their own, or return to the facility to have the method removed. However, when asked for specific circumstances that would prompt them to remove their method early, IUD users reported heavy bleeding, and implant users, the desire to get pregnant as the most likely reason to request early removal of their contraceptive device. Follow-up surveys and the mid-term IDIs are expected to provide additional and rich insights into the role of side effects in LARC discontinuation.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p><strong>Knowledge contribution</strong>: This study goes beyond the broad categories of factors that are known to lead to LARC discontinuation to focus on side effects, like bleeding disturbances, that we know are a major cause of contraceptive method discontinuation. These women, followed and interviewed for a 12-month period, provide a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of how side effects lead to discontinuation, or alternatively, how they lead to successful management and continuation of their chosen method. Thus, data collected on women’s experiences over time lead to valuable insights and useful recommendations for programming across several LARC contexts.</p><p>The data also facilitates distinctions between the contributions of personal, social, cultural, and service delivery factors. For example, general satisfaction with the method and the services provided by the three service delivery channels from which participants were recruited provide an opportunity to deconstruct effects specific to the channel and client-provider interaction. Our interviews also document other method information index (MII) items, since immediately post-service, we asked LARC acceptors if they were informed about the advantages/disadvantages, danger/warning signs of their method; who provided counseling; which methods the provider talked about; if the client felt comfortable talking to the provider, etc. Indeed, MII items are being used to assess the correlation between structural/process quality indicators and discontinuation, making this study’s findings an important source of validation in other contexts.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>When poorly managed, switching and discontinuing contraceptive methods can elevate a woman’s risk of unintended pregnancy. Switching to a less effective method—or discontinuing contraception can increase the risk of unintended pregnancy. Switching between methods of similar effectiveness may have fewer impacts; however, any switching (regardless of method) can potentially increase the risk of unintended pregnancy, as women are more likely to experience a method failure during the first months of use while adjusting to the new method. According to IDHS 2017, implant and IUD have the lowest discontinuation rates (9% and 6%). High rate of discontinuation were pill (46%) and injection (28%). So switching from LARCs to the short methods need to be addressed to prevent the discontinuation. This abstract uses survey data from Indonesia to better understand the patterns and reasons for switching from LARCs to inform program design. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Through this research, we sought to understand what accounts for this change and analyzes why women who have used a LARCs switched to a different method.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data were derived from Improving Contraceptive Method Mix (ICMM) Project in Indonesia, funded by USAID and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) conducted in 2016. The total sample size was 26,264 married women of reproductive age in twelve districts of two provinces in Indonesia. Using a multi-stage cluster design, 50 villages were selected from each district, and individuals (40 in East Java and 50 in West Nusa Tenggara Provinces) were selected randomly from each neighborhood.</p><p> </p><p>The participants were interviewed using structured questionnaires. This analysis only used data from the 2,644 women (10.1% of the total) who used an LARC as their first method; this allowed us to examine the pattern of switching from LARCs to other methods. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The majority of women (10.1%) who had used LARC were between 15 and 47 years old. For implant user, when switching methods, 31% switched to injection, 8% to pill, 2% sterilization and 27% not anymore using any other method. Among the IUD user, 18% switched to injection, 8% to pill, 6% to sterilization and 26% not using any other methods.  When asked about the reason for switching methods, women reported some of the reason were wanting to try other methods, side effect and more comfortable and practical with the current method. The findings showed that there were still clients who discontinue the implant and IUD use. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>By exploring LARC users’ reasons for changing contraceptive methods, this research has important implications for counseling and improving knowledge of client. The fact that many participants reported “wanting to try another method” as a key reason for switching from long-acting methods points to the importance of client education. Better counseling on side effect of each method, how to overcome this and the alternative methods are really important for the client before and after using LARCs. To decrease the rate of IUD and implant users switching to a short-term method, clients need to understand what to expect after implant and IUD insertion, what to do if they experience side effects, and who to contact if they need assistance or advice. Overall, this research shows that the issue of method switching should be addressed in order to provide women with sufficient information prior to choosing a method and prevent unintended pregnancies. </p><p> </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Intra-uterine contraceptive device is a globally acknowledged effective method of long acting spacing contraceptive and health systems are constantly strategizing for strengthening women’s access to the same. However, evidence shows that 33% of episodes contraceptive use were discontinued within 12 months (NFHS 4). IDF is implementing a project on improving access and quality of postpartum family planning services in Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand in close collaboration with Government of India and respective state Governments. We undertook a primary research to follow-up with women adopting IUCD services at six weeks and six months interval to understand the continuation pattern. This information is critical to planning future interventions in the project area and has the potential to inform IDF’s interventions in other parts of the country as well as similar interventions by partner organizations as well as Governments for ensuring higher quality of contraceptive services for women.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>As a measure of quality of training and services being offered as part of the collaborative project, this study was designed to assess the continuation rate for IUCD services offered at public health facilities as a sub-indicator of quality of services including counselling, clinical services and post-procedure care if any. We expect the findings from this research to inform our intervention approach for training and service delivery such that public health facilities offer women centric contraceptive counselling and services. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data on women seeking IUCD services from 82 health facilities spread over 19 districts in the two project states was collected from March 17 to January 2018. A team of researchers was oriented on interviewing women in their villages on their comfort with continued usage of IUCD service using a standardized interview tool.</p><p>A sample size of 2551 women using IUCD for at least six weeks and 2126 women using IUCD for over six months were interviewed as part of this study. A small sample of 88 women using IUCD services for over 12 months were also interviewed. The interview tool included questions to allude to reasons for continuation or discontinuing; removal, expulsion in a quality of care framework. The data from these interviews has been decoded and is in the process of being compiled in a report. While the preliminary findings have been used to inform this abstract, final findings shall be disseminated at the conference.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The preliminary findings suggest that 75% of women in the six week cohort and 76% women in the six month were continuing the use of IUCD. This information disaggregated for PPIUCD and Interval IUCD shows discontinuation of PPIUCD at 28% at six weeks and 26% at six months and for interval IUCD, 13% at six weeks and 16% at six months. Abdominal pain was quoted by 33% of the women who discontinued as the reason. Detailed information on reasons for discontinuation shall be shared at the conference. 6-9% of women who discontinued use of IUCD adopted another modern method of contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Preliminary results indicate that the implementation model is providing women high quality contraceptive services.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The rates of continuation for IUCD are in line with the national pattern or slightly better than that. This fairly high rate of continuation could be attributed to the client centric interventions at the facility. As part of our collaborative work with the Government, IDF is implementing an onsite model of training wherein a team of trainers visits public health facilities and trains the complete cohort of providers on comprehensive contraceptive care. This includes counselling, facility strengthening and building linkages with community outreach workers. We expect to share how high quality counselling, involvement of outreach workers and training of all cadres to not just provide services but creating an enabling environment help in strengthening quality of care. High continuation rates for IUCD services provided from these facilities is an indicator of successful training and implementation of not just IUCD but overall health services from these public health facilities.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Au Niger la couverture Sanitaire est faible, avec 48,31% de population ayant accès au Paquet Minimum d’Activités d’un Centre de Santé Intégrée (CSI). Pour renforcer l’accès des populations aux services de santé, le Niger a mis en place au niveau des villages communautaires plus de 2500 cases de santés (CS) tenues en majorité par des agents de santé communautaires (ASC).</p><p>C’est dans ce contexte, que le Niger a élaboré le plan national de repositionnement de la Planification Familiale, couvrant la période de 2013-2020 qui vise à rehausser la prévalence contraceptive de 12% en 2012 à 50% en 2020. </p><p>Le faible taux de couverture sanitaire combiné aux caractéristiques géographiques du Niger, la dispersion des localités en milieu rural et l’insuffisance de ressources humaines qualifiées  ont amené le Ministère de la Santé Publique (MSP) à développer des stratégies novatrices pour améliorer l’accès hors zones sanitaires aux services de Planification Familiale (PF). C’est ainsi que le MSP du Niger a décidé d’intégrer l’offre de services de planification familiale dans le paquet d’activités de 2507 cases de santé dans l’ensemble du Pays en vue d’améliorer l’accès physique hors couverture à la PF.</p>",

      "methodology": "<p>L’organisation technique du système de santé comprend huit (8) régions sanitaires regroupant quarante-quatre (44) Districts sanitaires. Le District Sanitaire représente le niveau Opérationnel avec les Hôpitaux de District (HD) et leurs réseaux de Centres de Santé Intégrés (CSI), de Cases de Santé (CS), les cabinets et les salles de soins privés. Chaque année le Ministère de la santé publique publie un annuaire des statistiques sanitaires qui résume toutes les données produites et fournies par les structures sanitaires du pays à l’issue d’un processus d’apurement et de validation des données de routine impliquant tous les acteurs du secteur de la santé. Le denier annuaire publié est celui de l’année 2016 présentant les données du 1er janvier au 31 décembre 2016.</p><p>Nous avons procédé à une analyse de la performance en matière de Planification Familiale des 2400 cases de santé fonctionnelles en 2016 par districts sanitaires et par région. L’analyse a consisté à mettre en exergue la part contributive des cases de santé au nombre total d'utilisatrices des méthodes de contraception rapportées en 2016 au niveau des huit (8)régions  et des 44 districts sanitaires.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Les résultats montrent l’efficacité de la décision du Niger d’intégrer l’offre de services de PF dans les activités des cases de santé situées dans les villages communautaires et tenues par les agents de santé communautaire. Sur les 2507 cases de santé du pays, 2400 sont fonctionnelles en 2016.</p><p>En 2016, sur les 1 068 124 femmes utilisatrices de méthodes modernes de contraception rapportées par le pays, 266 560 femmes proviennent des cases de santé soit une contribution de 25% au taux d’utilisation globale de la contraception. Une case de santé apporte en moyenne une cohorte de 111 femmes utilisatrices de méthodes modernes de contraception par an.</p><p>Au niveau des zones sanitaires régionales, les plus fortes contributions des cases de santé ont été enregistrées au niveau des régions de Tahoua (34%) et de Zinder avec 35%.  Au niveau de la région de Diffa ayant connue des déplacements des populations liés aux problèmes d’insécurité, les cases de santé enregistrent une performance de 9% des utilisatrices.</p><p>Au niveau des districts sanitaires, on note 4 districts dont plus de 40% des utilisatrices de PF proviennent des activités des cases de santé, notamment : Aguié (45%) ; Madaoua (65%) ; Magaria (42%) ; Matamèye (59%) ; leur permettant ainsi d’offrir la contraception à de nombreuses femmes en âge de procréer résidant en milieu rural et hors couverture sanitaire.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Dans un contexte de faible couverture sanitaire, la décision du Ministère de la Santé Publique  de permettre aux cases de santé d’offrir les méthodes de contraception (Pilules, préservatifs et Injectable Sayana Press) a permis d’améliorer l’accessibilité des populations aux services de PF de qualité. En effet, les cases de santé représentent 2400 points d'accès supplémentaires hors couverture sanitaires ayant offert des prestations de PF en 2016. Avec le nombre important d’utilisatrices de contraception moderne obtenues, on constate que le besoin en contraception existe au niveau communautaire hors couverture sanitaire. Il est donc possible de palier à l’obstacle de la couverture sanitaire par la mise en œuvre de ce genre de stratégies novatrices au niveau communautaire. Les relais DBC, les sorties foraines, les sorties mobiles peuvent également renforcées ce dispositif en milieux ruraux.</p><p>Cependant, il est nécessaire de renforcer le dispositif à travers les actions suivantes :</p><ul>\t<li>Améliorer l’analyse des données à travers la gamme des méthodes utilisées au niveau des cases de santé ;</li>\t<li>Analyser le taux d’abandon des méthodes de contraception au niveau des cases de santé ;</li>\t<li> Renforcer la délégation des taches au niveau des cases de santé avec l’ajout des méthodes de longue durée d’action (Implants).</li></ul>",

L'indice synthétique de fécondité a très peu évoluée entre 2003 à 2010 (6,2 à 6,0 enfants par femme) et a connu une légère baisse au cours des 5 dernières années passant à 5,4 enfants par femmes en 2015.</p><p> Pour accroitre la PC le Ministère de la santé et ses partenaires mettent en œuvre plusieurs stratégies incluant le renforcement des capacités des prestataires. Beaucoup de formation en cours d’emploi sont réalisées avec les limites inhérentes à une telle approche. En effet la formation en cours d’emploi bien que nécessaire pour mettre à jour maintenir les compétences des prestataires s’avère être une approche couteuse. Il s’avère donc nécessaire de renforcer la formation de base des prestataires de santé en s’assurant que les compétences clés liées aux programmes et stratégies majeures sont bien maitrisées par les nouveaux diplômés avant leur déploiement dans les formations sanitaires pour l’offre de services.</p>",

Les curricula de formation ont été revue à cet effet et les enseignants et encadreurs cliniques mis à jour sur la PFPP, les techniques d’enseignement efficace incluant la simulation avec les modèles anatomiques. Le projet apporte aussi un appui matériel et assure le mentorat et la supervision des nouveaux diplômés pour l’offre de service PF.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Le projet a concerné l’école nationale de santé publique de Ouagadougou qui forme les sages-femmes et l’unité de formation et de recherche en santé de l’université de Ouagadougou qui forme les gynécologues-obstétriciens. Le centre de simulation mis en place ont permis aux étudiants, avec l’encadrement des enseignants, de maitriser les compétences essentielles en PF notamment le counseling, la technique d’insertion et de retrait de dispositifs intra-utérin et des implants.</p><p> Dès le déploiement de la première cohorte de 232 sages-femmes et 18 gynécologues dotés de compétences en PFPP, le projet a équipé les sites pour l’offre de services. Un mécanisme de suivi-évaluation a aussi été mis en place avec des outils de collecte de données et une base de données est installée au niveau des districts sanitaires et au niveau central pour faciliter le suivi des indicateur clés de PFPP. Les données transmises mensuellement par les formations sanitaires aux districts sont analysées et utilisées pour la prise de décision. De 2015 à 2017, trois cohortes soit au total 732 sages-femmes et 75 gynécologues offrent les services PFPP dans 287 formations sanitaires reparties dans toutes les 13 régions du pays.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Avant l’introduction de la PFPP par Jhpiego au Burkina, les méthodes contraceptives étaient rarement proposées aux femmes dans le postpartum immédiat. Celles-ci devaient revenir à la sixième semaine après l’accouchement pour la consultation postnatale et la PF. Avec le déploiement depuis 2015 de nouveaux diplômés ayant des compétences en PFPP, 287 formations sanitaires dont 8 CHU/CHR, 46 hôpitaux de district et 233 centres de santé offrent actuellement des services de PFPP. Au cours des 2 premières années du projet, sur un total de 233 612 femmes ayant accouché dans les sites, 142 851 ont reçu un counseling avant de sortir de la maternité soit 61%. Cette couverture en counseling PFPP chez les accouchées dans les sites appuyés par le projet s’est accrue continuellement passant de 17% à la première année du projet à 72% au deuxième semestre de la deuxième année.</p><p>Parmi les femmes conseillées pour la PFPP, 113 394 ont adopté une méthode contraceptive (79%)</p><p>Les méthodes contraceptives modernes les plus fréquemment adoptées dans les sites PFPP sont les implants (32.2%), les injectables (22.2%) et le DIU (10.7%). En somme l’adoption des méthodes de longue durée d’action (MLDA) représente 42.9% de l’ensemble des méthodes dans les sites offrant les services de PFPP. L’acceptation du DIU dans les sites appuyés par le projet représente 11% des méthodes.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>En introduisant un enseignement basé sur l’acquisition des compétences en PFPP dans la formation de base des prestataires, cette intervention a contribué à doter les nouveaux diplômés des compétences nécessaires pour l’offre de services PFPP dès leur sortie de l’école.</p><p>Le projet a permis l’extension de l’offre de services PFPP dans le pays et atteint un grand nombre des femmes en période postpartum. Cette approche devrait être étendue à l’ensemble des écoles de formation en santé, publiques et privées, du pays car elle a pour avantage d’apporter un appui à la stratégie du Ministère de la santé qui a décidé de faire de la PFPP un axe majeur de sa politique d’accélération de la PF. Le Ministère de la santé avec l’appui de ce projet a conduit une mise à jour des documents de politiques normes et protocoles de santé de la reproduction. La PFPP a été prise en compte dans ces documents pour faciliter l’opérationnalisation de cette stratégie. Le Ministère de la santé a aussi planifié le passage à l’échelle du partage des tâches qui permettra aux accoucheuses auxiliaires d’offrir les MLDA. Pour ce faire l’approche d’intégration de la PFPP dans la formation de base devra à l’avenir concerner également les filaires de formations des accoucheuses auxiliaires et les écoles privées. Cela permettra sans doute de mieux répondre à la demande qui naitra de la mesure politique consacrant la gratuite des services PF que le Ministère lancera au cours de cette année 2018.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Le repositionnement  de la planification familiale (PF) a été initié  en 2003 au moment ou la prévalence contraceptive  était de 5,2 %, un indice synthétique de 8,2 %  et un besoin non satisfait de 32 % ; nombreuses femmes désireuses  de PF avaient trouvé un écho favorable.  Le taux élevé d’utilisation  des pratiques  traditionnelles aux vertus supposés contraceptives   était un défi  et une traduction des besoins non satisfaits.</p><p>L’UNFPA et l’USAID  ont  beaucoup contribué à la relance des activités PF en RDC en 2009 après la première conférence internationale de Kampala.</p><p>Dans la gamme des méthodes  contraceptives, les pilules, les injectables  et les implants  ont été assez vulgarisés, mais au résultat, la prévalence contraceptive  moderne  évolue très lentement  et  défié par la résistance des méthodes traditionnelles, aujourd’hui sur 24% de prévalence, il y a 10 % pour les méthodes modernes et 14 % pour les pratiques traditionnelles. La  contraception d’urgence  est très recherchée   mais  négligée  dans les  programmes, nombreuses femmes utilisant  ces choix traditionnels ont des grossesses non désirées.</p><p>Sur place, le besoin en  contraception d’urgence est très  élevé, mais l’accès à la pilule du lendemain  et  aux autres méthodes  modernes   ne leur sont pas  faciles. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Le recourt aux méthodes ou pratiques traditionnelles  de contraception d’urgence est très élevé,  pourquoi ces choix résistent aux méthodes modernes ? Quelles sont les femmes  qui en font recourt ?</p><p></p><p>La lecture  des faits  sur place, pense  que  la non vulgarisation sur la contraception moderne d’urgence  et  le manque  des intrants sur terrain  serait  la cause, d’un manque à gagner (contraception d’urgence moderne)  qui contribuerait beaucoup à l’amélioration de la prévalence contraceptive moderne.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Cette recherche a été menée à Lubumbashi du 15 Février au 15 juillet 2017  auprès  des 52 responsables des programmes  de planification  familiale et 200 femmes désireuses de la PF moderne, rencontrées dans 20 centres de santé  par un consortium Association de santé familiale, DKT International et la coordination provinciale du Programme national santé de reproduction. </p><p>Une interview  basée sur un questionnaire structurée a  été administré par  des enquêteurs  formés  à chaque responsable du programme choisis dans le secteur public et privé, et à chacune des femmes désireuses  rencontrées.  Les résultats  sont obtenus par  analyse descriptive</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>La contraception d’urgence  n’est pas très connue, 100% des responsables de programmes  interviewés reconnaissent  que la contraception d’urgence est abordée a titre d’information, parmi eux 57%  reportent le manque d’intrants, 48 %  reportent une mauvaise utilisation des méthodes, 87 % justifient  le recourt aux choix traditionnels  par ignorance des choix modernes ;  62% pensent que les pharmaciens qui vendent les méthodes n’ont pas une formation appropriée pour administrer les méthodes.</p><p>Alors que les pilules  combinés et à progestérone et le dispositif intra utérin peuvent être utilisés dans la contraception d’urgence, 95 % de responsables s’accordent que les prestataires manquent des connaissances  appropriées  pour fournir cette méthode.</p><p></p><p>Les femmes désireuses / utilisatrices de la méthode de contraception d’urgence  appartiennent à toutes les tranches d’âge ;  20-29 ans  51%, 30-49 33%, 39 et plus 10 %  et les mois de 19 ans, 6%.  Elles ont des différents niveaux d’éducation, primaire 39%, secondaires 42% et universitaire 19%. Les  célibataires  en font recourt à  59 %  et les maries à 41%. Les pratiques traditionnelles utilisées sont  le retrait,  Douche vaginale post coïtale, position accroupie post orgasmique, et les médicaments.</p><p></p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>La contraception d’urgence  est  un aspect  négligé du programme de planification familiale moderne, pourtant  elle est parmi les méthodes les plus  recherchées    par les femmes et couples désireux.  Aussi, les femmes qui en cherchent s’adonnent aux pratiques  à  la porte de leur mains, et sont victimes de ce qu’elles veulent éviter  parce que ces pratiques ne sont pas sures.</p><p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Les besoins non satisfaits en planification familiale moderne sont un fait réel  dans notre communauté, l’inaccessibilité à la contraception d’urgence est un des éléments  qui expliquent  un recourt  aux  pratiques  contraceptives  traditionnelles sans résultats attendus. Ceci explique en partie, aujourd’hui, pourquoi dans le pays  sur 24% de prévalence contraceptive,  les pratiques traditionnelles reviennent à    14%  contre 10 % pour les méthodes modernes.</p><p></p><p>L’implication du secteur public, la formation du personnel des programmes  et des prestataires  de service en contraception d’urgence  contribuent à l’intégration de cette méthode  dans la gamme de PF moderne. La création de la demande, la disponibilité aussi bien dans les cliniques que dans les pharmacies des méthodes contraceptives modernes d’urgence, sont  parmi les approches capables de changer le cap et faire contribuer  la méthode dans la prévalence locale et nationale.</p><p></p><p>Etant le moment  le plus fréquent de la demande de contraception, la fourniture de la contraception  d’urgence est une opportunité d’introduction  aux autres méthodes contraceptives modernes de longues et de courtes durées. De cette façon, elle est capable de contribuer  au programme pays qui doit fournir 2,1 millions des nouvelles acceptantes dans le cadre  de programme planification 2020</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Au Cameroun, 34 % des femmes en âge de procréer (FAP) utilisent une méthode de contraception, mais seulement 21% utilisent une contraception moderne. De plus, parmi ces femmes qui utilisent les méthodes traditionnelles, seulement 55% connaissent suffisamment leur cycle menstruel afin d’éviter une grossesse et en général, 6 sur 10 femmes ont un besoin non satisfait en matière de contraception moderne. Par ailleurs, malgré les dispositions pénales contre l’avortement, 21% des FAP ont affirmé au cours d’une étude qu’elles avaient déjà eu un avortement et 40% parmi ces dernières avaient déclaré avoir fait plus d’un avortement. L’avortement non sécurisé et les hémorragies post-partum sont les causes principales des décès maternels au Cameroun. C’est dans ce contexte de faible pratique contraceptive moderne, de problématique de grossesses non-désirées, qu’il s’est avéré important de mieux comprendre  les pratiques de contraception d’urgence non conventionnels et d’avortements clandestins au Cameroun, en vue d’une meilleure orientation des interventions visant à accroitre l’accès et la demande des méthodes contraceptives modernes.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>La gestion/peut des grossesses non désirées comporte des pratiques informelles de contraception  d’urgence assimilables aux avortements clandestins, tant au niveau de l'objectif recherché par la femme qui la pratique, qu’au niveau des méthodes utilisées et des risques courus. Cette étude nous a permis de cerner dans une mesure, le contexte de pratique de la contraception d'urgence et, ainsi que le besoin d’un meilleur accès aux produits et services liées à la contraception pour une gestion sans risque des cas de grossesses non désirées. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>En mai 2017, une étude qualitative avait été menée auprès des FAP des villes de Yaoundé et de Douala. 13 entretiens individuels avaient été conduits auprès de des femmes âgées de 21 à 44 ans, et  4 groupes de discussion focalisés avaient été réalisés avec 36 femmes âgées de 21 à 40 ans.  Les entretiens et les discussions étaient conduits sur la base d’un guide d’interview ou de discussion. Les entretiens individuels approfondis étaient menés uniquement avec les femmes ayant déjà personnellement eu une IVG, pendant que les entretiens de groupes étaient un mixte de femmes  l’ayant vécu par personnes interposées ou par elles-mêmes. Les premières étaient recrutées à travers le réseau des prestataires de franchise social ProFam de l’ACMS et les clubs réglos du programme 100%Jeunes. Les entretiens étaient enregistrés sur support numériques audios. Par la suite, ils avaient été transcrits verbatim, puis codifiés par thème et analysés avec le logiciel NVivo version 10.</p><p>Il est à noter que cette étude avait reçu la clairance éthique du Comité Nationale pour le Recherche en Santé du Cameroun. Un consentement éclairé été reçu des participants avant le début des entretiens.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Des analyses, il ressort que les femmes interviewées connaissent certaines méthodes contraceptives modernes. Les préservatifs masculins sont les plus citées, pendant que les d’autres contraceptifs modernes sont porteurs des préjugés véhiculées par certains prestataires de services de PF. Dans ce sillage, les pilules du lendemain sont peu connues ; pourtant plusieurs femmes déclarent adopter des formes populaires ou traditionnelles de contraceptifs quelques heures, jours ou même semaines, après un rapport sexuel soupçonné pouvant aboutir à une grossesse. Dans ces cas, les pratiques suivantes sont observées : boire du whisky mélangé avec du nescafé avec ou sans du miel pendant 3 jours ; boire du sel gemme « Tchoukouri » dilué dans une petite quantité d’eau ou du whisky mélangé avec du paracétamol et du miel ; ou insérer dans le vagin les feuilles d’une herbe « Evouvous» ou les jeunes pousses des feuilles de manioc écrasées, roulées en petite boule en forme d’ovule.  </p><p>Parallèlement, des méthodes similaires sont utilisées pour induire les avortements clandestins. Des 13 femmes interviewées, 4 avaient utilisées chacune le whisky, le miel par la bouche, la purgation avec du sel, les racines du manioc. La prise de ces potions naturelles provoque des effets indésirables tels que de la fièvre, des hémorragies abondantes, un état palustre, de fortes douleurs au ventre. Selon les connaissances populaires, il est clairement décrit dans quel cas adopter telle ou telle autre méthode, sous peine de décès, la finalité quel que soit la méthode étant d’être libre de toute grossesse non-désirée.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Les femmes préfèrent utiliser les préservatifs, ainsi que les méthodes populaires courantes de contraception d’urgence. Il est aussi ressortir que plusieurs femmes ne discernent pas la prise d’une contraception d’urgence convention/non conventionnelle d’une méthode purement abortive. En adoptant de telles méthodes, avec posologie et indication, les FAP interviewées montrent, qu’elles ont une certaine maîtrise de leur santé reproductive/fécondité. Ainsi, cette étude suggère que l’accès aux produits et informations adéquats sur les contraceptifs peuvent réduire les risques liés à l’adoption des méthodes informelles</p><p>Il serait dès lors important qu’une communication précise et ciblée soit intensifiée, dans les endroits régulièrement fréquentées par les femmes (tontines, les salons de coiffures et soins de beauté) pour faciliter l’adoption des méthodes de contraceptions modernes scientifiquement maîtrisées. Par ailleurs, il serait nécessaire d’investiguer davantage sur ces méthodes non conventionnelles, afin d’augmenter la connaissance des FAP sur ces méthodes et  déconstruire les préjugés sur les méthodes modernes de contraception. En outre, une étude doit être menée afin d'approfondir la connaissance des éffets des produits couramment utilisés, sur la santé reproductive des femmes .</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 20% of the demand for contraception is being satisfied by modern methods (FP2020). With only 20% of health facilities across DRC providing high-quality family planning services, women do not have access to modern, effective methods. DMPA-SC and subdermal contraceptive implants have been demonstrated to be safe and effective methods that women in DRC prefer, but historically they have only been provided in clinical settings, or in the case of DMPA-SC, by trained community-based distributors (CBDs). To expand access in the community to these methods, Tulane University and Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH) conducted two pilot studies where medical and nursing school (M/NS) students inserted subdermal implants and trained women to self-inject DMPA-SC. These innovative task-shifting approaches expand the number of providers qualified to administer these methods, but M/NS students must still be supervised, receive commodities, and refer women to facilities for management of side effects, continuation, and removal of implants. Successful scalability of these task-shifting models relies on integrating M/NS student providers into the larger health system, strong supervision and referral networks, and reliable commodity chains.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objective of this research is to assess the training, supervision, and referral practices of M/NS students from the perspectives of these community-based providers and their clients. This study evaluates the feasibility of integrating M/NS students into the health system as providers of DMPA-SC and subdermal implants in the community.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Researchers at Tulane University and KSPH conducted two pilot studies in Kinshasa, DRC in 2016-2017 where M/NS students 1) trained women to self-inject DMPA-SC and 2) inserted implants in the community setting. M/NS students provided education and counseling to women regarding the management of these methods, including referral for side effects, continuation of DMPA-SC, and implant removal. MN/S students received 5-7 days of training in recruitment, counseling, and methods currently offered in the community: pills, condoms, CycleBeadsTM, and DMPA-SC. The M/NS students who trained self-injectors (N=53) and who inserted subdermal implants (N=48) were surveyed at the point of service. Self-injector client surveys (N=415) were conducted at initial acceptance and at three and six months after service. Implant acceptor surveys (N=531) were conducted at initial acceptance and at six and twelve months after service. Surveys were collected by trained data collectors on smartphones usingOpenDataKit (ODK), and descriptive statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 13. M/NS student surveys assessed perceptions about the training received, supervision, commodity supply, confidence in providing the service, community support, and retention of concepts learned in training. Acceptors were asked questions relating to their service experience, confidence in provider, method satisfaction, side effects, and continuation intentions. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Across the two pilots, the average age of M/NS students was 26. Most providers (72%) were nursing students, while the rest were medical students. Students from two medical schools and seven nursing schools participated in this study. Of the students providing DMPA-SC, 65% reported having contact with a supervisor during the pilot; of these 50% received supervision from their school, and 32% received supervision from pilot program staff. Students providing implants had more contact with supervisors (77%); most supervision came from their school (47%) and program staff (33%). Most students (72%) in the DMPA-SC group reported that they felt their training was completely adequate; 65% of students in the implant group felt the same.</p><p>Most students providing DMPA-SC (71%) reported that they ran out of product; their stock-outs lasted a median of 7 days. More students providing implants ran out of product (81%), and their stock-outs lasted longer (median 10 days). Just over half (57%) of all students felt that health facilities completely approve of their role; this approval rating was constant across groups. Most (85%) of all students knew which facilities to refer women to for side effect management. More implant students (87%) than DMPA-SC students (79%) reported knowing staff at these referral centers. </p><p>Women had positive reactions to having student CBDs; 81% of DMPA-SC acceptors and 91% of implant users reported being comfortable with this model. Twelve months after receiving services and counseling from M/NS students, 84% of implant acceptors knew where to have the implant removed. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Community-based provision of family planning is a well-established model that has demonstrated success in greatly expanding access to contraception in low resource settings. These pilot studies represent significant advances in efforts to bring highly effective, modern family planning methods into the community setting in DRC where they were previously unavailable. Through task-shifting, M/NS students can contribute in a significant way to expanding access to modern contraception in DRC by diversifying the method availability and by offering high quality counseling and education services.</p><p>Women served by M/NS students felt comfortable with the services they received, and M/NS students also felt confident providing these services. However, many students report no contact with a supervisor as well as high numbers of stock-outs lasting multiple days. Students also received most of their supervision from their schools, and while they generally had positive relationships with facility staff, they did not yet feel completely accepted by this staff. For this model to grow in scale, formalized supervision models should be explored that bring facility staff to the supervision table. While students will always need to report to faculty, they should also feel comfortable seeking support from facility staff permanently located in the community and near the point of service. </p><p>Additional research on the M/NS student CBD model should include input from M/NS faculty providing supervision. In these pilots, faculty served as both educators and supervisors, and they would have valuable input about how to improve sustainability through better integration into the existing health system. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Integration of services for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is globally recognized as beneficial to both clients and health providers with improvements in quality and efficient use of resources. Yet even with the increasing attention to the experience of the client, decisions surrounding where and when to offer services as part of an integrated package have implications for health systems.  Although there is a growing body of evidence, research is still needed to determine and demonstrate the value of SRH integration in different settings and situations. The Ministry of Health (MOH) Rwanda, in collaboration with its partners, continues to implement different strategies to accelerate the reduction of maternal mortality and to improve access to quality sexual reproductive health services. As part of these efforts, the MOH and Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) collaborated with Bixby Center of the University of California, Berkeley to design and implement a model for integrating family planning (FP) into all SRH services. The resulting intervention relies on a client-centered approach to provide high quality, integrated, comprehensive SRH services which include abortion and post-abortion FP services with emphasis on long acting reversible contraception (LARC).</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>We utilized a client-centered approach to provide high quality, integrated comprehensive abortion and post-abortion family planning services with emphasis on LARC, with following objectives: 1) Implement integration package, including policies and strategies, provider trainings, job aids, and IEC materials; 2) Ensure availability of supplies; and 3) establish monitoring and evaluation system. The following steps were taken to achieve these objectives: i) assessed the needs for training, policies, guidelines, and procedures; ii) designed and implemented a replicable model of service integration in two districts; and iii) designed and implemented strategies to increase uptake of post-abortion FP, with special attention to LARC.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The integration package was implemented in 33 health facilities; 15 public and 2 religious health centers in the district of Huye, and 14 public and 2 religious health centers in the district of Musanze. Providers were trained to offer counseling, testing, and treatment services for a multitude of SRH indicators to ensure clients received as many aspects of care as needed from one point of service. FP materials, including contraceptives and post-abortion care supplies, were provided to participating health facilities.</p><p>Data for this study come from ongoing data collection, in which providers complete an intake form that obtains information on client socio-demographics and services received. We collected data on age, sex, and reason for consultation, as well as whether the client received counseling or testing on SRH services and cancer screenings. These included FP method, post-abortion care, gender-based violence, HIV, STI, cervical screenings, and breast cancer. Information was collected on client referrals, and providers recorded their qualification level and whether they were trained on the integrated SRH program.</p><p>We used data from the first three months of the program, September through November 2016, to review the program and proceeded with implementation of relevant program improvements.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary results demonstrated that 7,444 female clients were seen across the 33 health facilities of Huye and Musanze over the three month time period. Among these women, 3,703 were not pregnant and not already using an FP method, indicating they were eligible to receive an FP method. Nearly half (46.1%) of these 3,703 women received a contraceptive method, with 44.5% of the 1,708 new users having obtained their method outside of FP services.</p><p>Nearly all (98.9%) clients who went to the FP service received a contraceptive method. Among those who went for post-natal care (PNC) services, 65.4% received a method, and 48.5% of those attending for HIV services received a contraceptive. Almost half (43.8%) of clients in the youth corners received an FP method. Only 23.6% of women in maternity services obtained a method.</p><p>The method most commonly adopted was the implant, with 886 new users across all three months, and 223 new IUD users. These 1,109 LARC users accounted for 64.9% of all FP adopters, followed by the injectable at 17.9% of all new users.</p><p>We will continue to input data for 2017 to assess changes in FP uptake within these health facilities and assess the effectiveness of integration over time.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>SRH and sustainable development are inextricably linked. Health and development share common determinants and goals, such as delivering on the promise of health, gender equality and human rights for all. Integrating SRH services makes sense given the overlapping and interconnected behaviors and needs involved in preventing and treating sexually transmitted infections (including STI and HIV), screening for and treating certain cancers, and controlling fertility through contraception or childbearing. However, the effect of structural integration on uptake of different FP methods, particularly after abortion services, has not been adequately addressed in the literature. Rigorous data and thoughtful frameworks are crucial to expanding the evidence base. The review of this program demonstrated that integration of SRH services leads to FP uptake, and particularly high LARC uptake, in different service delivery contexts. The integration program exposed clients to different types of SRH care that they might not otherwise have been offered, and led to most eligible clients adopting a contraceptive method. These data indicate that integration has a positive impact on client SRH service utilization among those who would not have used a traditional FP clinic.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Over the past decade, Rwanda’s government commitment to family planning and maternal and child health has led to significant advances. Evidenced by its MDGs achievement, Rwanda’s DHS has recorded great progress, including births at facilities attended by skilled health personnel continuously rising from 31% in 2000 to 69% in 2010 to 91% in 2015. Yet with 84% of Rwanda’s population residing in rural areas, geographic inequitable access to facilities remains a dangerous threat to care. Though strategic facility infrastructure development has led to patients’ average walking distances to facilities decreasing from 95 minutes in 2006 to 56.5 in 2014, a significant proportion of the population must still walk more than 60 minutes to reach the nearest health facility. Rwanda’s 2015 DHS showed discrepancies between urban and rural-residing women in their modern contraception use (51% vs. 47%), lack of family planning messaging exposure (40% vs. 47%), and total family planning unmet need (17% vs. 19%). The potential geographic inequitable impact on family planning access could be detrimental: only 44% completing the 4 recommended ANC, only 53% of married women and 31% of all women using family planning modern methods, and post-natal checkups only at 19% and 43% for newborns and mothers.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Historically, Rwanda’s Health Centers geographically spread across sector-level were citizens’ first facility entry point to decentralized primary healthcare and family planning services. To reach citizens still over 60 minutes from Health Centers, Rwanda recently created the Health Post, a new, nurse-led facility further decentralizing services to the cell (geographic area smaller than a sector but larger than a village) level. A mandatory Health Post service package was created, includes family planning (condoms, pills, and injectable), postnatal consultation, and pregnancy testing. At program scale up completion, Rwanda aims to develop 1 Health Post per cell through an innovative Public-Private Partnership model.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Rwanda’s decentralized healthcare service approach has encouraged the development of its tiered, referral-based pyramid Health Sector, geographically stretching from specialized services at national, tertiary facilities down to primary healthcare across sectors country-wide through Health Centers. The Health Post facility intervention fits directly into this larger, national geographic web of facilities. Using the referral system methodology already in place, MOH is creating Health Posts and linking them- from procurement, to clinical supervision, and monitoring and evaluation data- to already-present sector and district health facilities.</p><p>To quickly develop cost-effective, sustainable facilities to meet the unmet primary care and family planning needs of the population, two models were developed: a public Health Post and a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Health Post. Public Posts are supervised and directly linked to sector Health Centers. Pioneering a new, more sustainable step, PPP Posts are being built and managed through shared responsibility between the community, local leadership, private nurses, and the Ministry of Health.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Thus far, a total of 501 Health Posts have been established, 274 Public Posts and 227 PPP Posts have been created. Each now offer the mandated service package, which includes vital family planning services. The Ministry of Health estimates that the development of these facilities has significantly cut down on patient walking distance times, from over 1 hour to 20 minutes. Bringing modern contraception methods, pregnancy testing, and antenatal and postnatal care one step closer to village level, preliminary findings from these facilities show increasing uptake of family planning services and overall health benefit for women and children. In addition, the creation of facilities has led to job creation, and thus economic improvement, for nurses, spreading potential poverty-reducing development to these health professional individuals, their families, and their communities. Preliminary investment cost findings show that each Health Post’s building and equipping requires a needed investment of $24,000 USD. With an estimated 1,2000 Health Posts needed to still be built to ensure equitable geographic facility coverage at this facility tier with Rwanda’s national target of 1 Health Post per cell, the fiscal burden on the Health Sector mounts to $28,800,000. The innovative PPP Health Post model intervention, with preliminary program evaluation showing the model’s effectiveness, offers a sustainable solution. With investment, staffing, and management costs shared between the community, local leadership, private nurses, and the Ministry of Health, public and private partners can share the fiscal burden so that cost does not slow or bar the timely creation of these needed facilities.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p></p><p>With 13% and 11% of all women in rural and urban areas, respectively, reporting unmet need for family planning in 2015, and with 91% of Rwandans simultaneously reporting the government as their source of modern contraception in this same year, the Government of Rwanda, and its Health Sector specifically, Rwanda recognized the need to expand family planning access, particularly to rural areas, by further decentralizing health facilities and services packages. The innovative creation of Health Posts as a cell-level facility intervention has offered the country a solution to reach citizens even closer to home. Through integrated service packaging, these Health posts are now bringing family planning (contraception, pregnancy testing, etc.), antenatal and prenatal care, maternal and child health services, and health education and messaging closer to those once citizens bared by distance. Understanding the financial means needed to expand the Health Post model nationally, Rwanda’s creation of the PPP Health Post model has allowed for strategic, cost-effective and sustainable development. This partnership encourages sustainability through rooting the ownership and management of the Health Posts in the heart of the community. Though continued evaluation is needed, preliminary program findings are encouraging. Driven by guiding principles of universal healthcare coverage and health as a human right, the PPP Health Post model offers a promising route through which the Ministry of Health can bring expanded access to primary healthcare and family planning services to those most vulnerable.</p>",

Expanding access to family planning is often difficult in Northern Nigeria and involves innovative approaches. Kaduna State located in North West Nigeria enjoys the support of several partners. Many partners support Kaduna State in child spacing. However, the massive support provided is harvested in minor leap results when partners operate on their own. To demonstrate the advantage of multi-sectoral partnerships in improving population health through access to family planning services, UNFPA supported the Kaduna State Planning and Budget Commission to convene the key family planning partners in the State for a joint activity aimed at increasing access to family planning information, products and services. The 2017 World Population Day, which had the theme \"Family Planning: Empowering People, Developing Nations\", was the in-road for demonstration of effective partnership. Kaduna aims to move its Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) from 20% to 46.5% by the end of 2018, therefore, the unique opportunity was used to ensure a cross-sectoral collaboration. Five key Government Ministries and Agencies and 4 development partners collaborated with the common goal of boosting the uptake of FP.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The five key Government Ministries and Agencies are Kaduna State Planning and Budget Commission; Ministry of Health &amp; Human Services; State Primary Health Care Development Agency; Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and Ministry of Education, Science and Technology while the four development partners are UNFPA; NURHI2; DfID-funded MNCH2 project and USAID-funded SHOPS project) collaborated. The partners leveraged resources with each making commitment in one form or the other- financial, material and human resources. The primary target was women of child bearing age 15-49 years. The opportunity was used for massive mobilization of communitiy members, delivery of Family Planning services and reduction of unmet need.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Four Local Government Areas (LGA) with the highest unmet need for family planning in Kaduna State and furthest behind, were identified for the intervention. Prior contact was made with the Primary Health Care department of the LGAs for a clear mapping of underserved communities within the LGAs and identification of the health workers to participate in the 7-day community outreach exercise. The process was divided into 3 key phases – pre-implementation, implementation and post-implementation phase. Six preparatory meetings were held prior to the implementation phase to determine the requirements and assign roles and responsibilities for a successful exercise. In addition, steps were taken to provide orientation to the identified personnel expected to participate in the outreach activities. The National Health Management Information System (NHMIS) was given a central place by ensuring that the service data generated was recorded in the standard daily NHMIS register of the health facilities. The activity was conducted over a period of 7days in each of the four LGAs (2 days community mobilization, sensitization and lecture series for secondary school teachers who will transmit the knowledge to students in schools and 5 days family planning service delivery).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Across the four Local Government Areas, 312 secondary school teachers gained additional knowledge and skills that made them understand clearly that the health of women is preserved with an improvement in overall quality of life if they are able to enjoy the freedom to control the number and spacing of their childbirths. The teachers made commitment to transmit the knowledge to students in their lessons. About 340,169 persons were reached with key messages during the community mobilization exercise. New acceptors of family planning reached with family planning services were 2,542. Further analysis of the data in relation to the previous month’s NHMIS data submission for the LGAs showed that on average, there was a 49% increase in the number of women that took up family planning as new acceptors, compared to the previous month. This is illustrated in Table 1 below: </p><p><strong>Table 1</strong>: <em>Data showing new family planning acceptors reached during the exercise compared to the previous month in the four focal Local Government Areas of Kaduna State, Nigeria</em></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>LGA</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>New Acceptors Reached</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>% Increase</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Previous month</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Exercise month</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Difference</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Chikun</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>2,461</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>3,802</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>1,341</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>54</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Igabi</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>1,163</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>1,730</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>567</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>49</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Kauru</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>749</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>945</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>196</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>26</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Soba</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>824</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>1,262</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>438</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>53</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Total</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>5,197</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>7,739</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2, 542</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>49</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Although organizations may have different structures and approaches, they can work together effectively toward common purposes and achieve shared results. The cross-sectoral partnership demonstrated in Kaduna State between multiple government agencies on one hand and development partners on the other, akin to the sector-wide approach, yielded the desired results of significantly increasing access to family planning information and services, for community members and more especially, women in locations with the highest unmet need.</p><p>The multi-sectoral approach provided a more holistic way of tackling challenges, as each organization brought in their competitive advantage, hence more coverage. A key lesson learnt from the exercise is that the result obtained in a multi-sectoral approach both in terms of cost (ability to do more at less cost to each organization) and impact (ability to reach more beneficiaries through collective efforts) was considerably high. Also underscored is the need to establish regular community outreach to supply and sustain the needs of the new acceptors who may find it difficult to schedule a visit to the nearest health facility in their communities. Family planning is indeed everyone’s business and the key messages must be widely spread in all directions through collective efforts, to safeguard the health and well-being of women, households, communities and nations. </p>",

      "title": "Leveraging public private synergy to meet the contraceptive needs of India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The state of Rajasthan, India, is at the forefront of expanding access to modern contraceptives. However, because of limited choice of methods and focus on permanent methods in country, use of spacing methods is low. As per the National Family Health Survey (2015-16), Rajasthan’s mCPR among married women (15-49 Yrs.) is 53.5% with current use of female sterilization (40.7 %), oral pill (2.4%), intra-uterine contraceptive device (1.2%), and condom (8.7%).</p><p>Evidence on contraceptive method mix indicates that with the addition of one method, mCPR increases by 3-4%. In 2016, the Government of India updated its national policy to include injectable contraception within the public health system. Rajasthan state government saw an opportunity to expand contraceptive choice to 17 million women in the state. With no budget to procure commodities and no concrete plan for introducing the new method, the state approached Pathfinder International, to identify alternative strategies to introduce, procure, and launch injectables.</p><p>Corporates in India, by law, are required to contribute 2% of their profits towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. With a favourable national policy, CSR initiative and a willing state government, Pathfinder saw an advocacy opportunity for mobilizing the corporate sector to expand method mix in the state.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Since 2016, Pathfinder, in partnership with the Advance Family Planning (AFP) project has advocated to increase corporate commitment for family planning (FP) through investments for FP in their CSR activities. In Rajasthan, Pathfinder collaborated with state government in December 2016 for improving FP indicators through evidence based advocacy.</p><p>First, the organization assessed the support required by the state and then advocated with various private corporations between January - March 2017 to support the state in injectable contraceptive roll out. Pathfinder’s advocacy strategized around each company’s background, its existing CSR initiatives, and aligning these with India’s CSR policy.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Pathfinder facilitated an exposure visit for Rajasthan government officials to Haryana state, where it supported introduction of injectable contraceptives in the public health system. Following the exposure visit, the government team recommended the introduction of injectables as a pilot.</p><p>Successive state-level consultations were held with the Mission Director, National Health Mission (MD-NHM) for the rollout of injectable contraceptives. Bhilwara district was selected as a pilot due to poor FP indicators as compared to the state, but more importantly due to the availability of motivated government officials. The key ‘ask’ was identified.</p><p>Simultaneously, Pathfinder approached private companies and held meetings to seek financial support for commodity supplies (of injectables) and capacity building of service providers, which were key ‘asks’ identified in consultation with the government. Mylan Pharmaceuticals India Private Limited expressed their intention to provide support.</p><p>Pathfinder used the AFP SMART advocacy approach to strategize for an effective rollout of injectables across all public facilities.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>As a result of sustained advocacy efforts, the Government of Rajasthan launched injectable contraceptives in May 2017 across 98 facilities of Bhilwara District, thereby ensuring availability and accessibility of injectable services till peripheral health facilities. Rajasthan became the second state in India to provide injectable contraceptives free of cost in public health facilities. Mylan Pharmaceuticals supplied 25,000 units (worth US $68,061) of injectable contraceptives and supported with additional funds ($3,125) for training of service providers in the district. Additionally, the state health department also reallocated $1,562 of unspent resources for capacity building of providers.</p><p>The district government led the capacity building efforts for service providers and planned the roll-out strategy. 447 service providers across the district were trained. Between May 2017 and June 2018, a total of 7,513 new users have been registered. Of these, 5,760 users have returned for second dose, 4,149 for third dose and 1,481 for fourth dose. Further, the state government has agreed to include Injectable DMPA in the state non-Essential Drug List which would enable the state to budget and procure injectable commodities as required. The injectable contraceptives have now been rolled-out across the state as a national initiative and the programmatic learnings from Bhilwara are adopted elsewhere in the state.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Complementing FP services through strategic partnerships with the corporate sector support is feasible and crucial in moderate resource settings. Development partners and non-government organizations can play an important role in forging public-private partnerships in FP. Such partnerships, when undertaken in a transparent manner and without arising conflict of interest, can help create confidence in the corporate sector.</p><p>Use of advocacy approaches can help organizations to identify and define key ‘asks’ and help prioritize human and financial resources. Advocacy tools can be used among a variety of stakeholders (government, corporate, and NGOs) and at all levels of administration (state, district, and sub-district).</p><p>Corporate Social Responsibility in India is still in its nascent stage with most corporates in the process of defining their CSR frameworks and thematic areas for allocations. Effective advocacy tools can help corporates identify priority areas in need of CSR initiatives. Moving forward, advocacy efforts need to be sustained towards ensuring commodity security by inclusion of injectables in the state essential drug list. </p>",

      "title": "Private Public Partnership to Deliver Dramatically Improved Family Planning Outcomes in Public Health Facilities in Gaza Province, Mozambique",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>As a part of FP2020, the Government of Mozambique committed to increase the country’s modern contraceptive prevalence rate among from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 34 percent by 2020. In 2015, the modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (mCPR) in Gaza Province was significantly above the national average with 41.9% mCPR, but with a remaining unmet need of 22.4% and a heavy reliance on short acting methods (91.8% of mCPR).</p><p>Within Gaza, there is a ratio of 101 health providers/ 100,000 inhabitants and this scenario can be more critical when it comes to SRH services. Provider availability is especially critical in non-urban areas where the MCH nurse is often the only provider and responsible for a diverse spectrum of services that can bias counseling towards short acting methods which are quicker to administer.</p><p>In 2014, PSI Mozambique launched a network of family planning clinics named TEM+ “We Have More” to compliment the public sector in underserved areas, aimed to build a network of providers offering quality family planning services at subsidized rates. TEM+ demonstrated an unmet demand and willingness to pay for family planning services, serving between 600-800 women per month, as well as, delivering LARC methods at 3-4 times the national average.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>PSI and Gaza provincial Health Authorities (DPS)  agreed to partner to apply the same social marketing strategies for family planning services, but within the public sector. The model prioritized health units that have a high demand for FP services but limited provider bandwidth to deliver them. PSI placed a trained and dedicated MCH nurses offering comprehensive SRH services into these health units, through four integrated key components: demand creation, services delivery, quality assurance and data driven performance management.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Demand creation applying social marketing principles is conducted primarily through TEM+ community health promoters (five to ten per site) that are identified and recruited from the community. Promoters provide information to both individuals, families (couples counseling), and communities.  TEM+ nurses at the health units receives women refered by promotors requesting additional information or services and offer a package of integrated SRH services, including counselling, HIV/STI and pregnancy screening, and can provide contraceptives, including: oral contraceptives, injectables, implants and IUDs. Referrals are tracked through a simple SMS technology, Movercado, which enables PSI to measure individual performance, as well as pay a portion of promoter’s incentives based on the performance. Providers are assessed against WHO, MISAU, and PSI standards, which are recorded on “Health Network Quality Information System” (HNQIS) a tablet based system to enable transparent, real-time access to the performance results. Over the past four years, TEM+ has invested in building robust data management systems, which provide real-time information in DHIS2 and enable a rich analysis of program performance accessible by all stakeholders, which improve management response time, reduce operational costs, and facilitate data-drive programmatic performance discussions. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During 2017, TEM+ delivered more than 13.5% of CYPs delivered in Gaza Province through 12 TEM+ clinics out of 135 facilities in the province (8 in partnership with the public sector and 4 in partnership with the private sector).</p><p>Within Gaza, comparing the service data from 6-months before the TEM+ program initiated in Gaza and the same 6-month period in 2017, TEM+ generated a 345% increase in the number of women receiving family planning services (9,827 to 43,731 methods provided) and a 439% increase in CYPs (2,843 to 15,324 CYPs delivered) when comparing the health unit family planning performance 6-months before the TEM+ program initiated and the same 6-month period after TEM+ implementation in public health clinics.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Considering the significant increase in family planning access and uptake, the DPS and PSI are entering a new programmatic phase to capture learnings, then package and standardize the learnings replication in additional sites. Given the investment in the TEM+ nurse family planning knowledge and ability, the DPS and PSI are exploring how the TEM+ can become an “FP Champion” within their sites to support the skills development of additional providers in their facility. This is especially strategic as Mozambique has recently approved a strategy to integrate and provide family planning counseling services within all ‘doors’ or service areas of a health center. The TEM+ nurse has the opportunity to lend her family planning counseling techniques and clinical knowledge to support and provide resources for her peer providers. Additionally, the DPS and PSI are exploring how to cascade components of the model towards additional health units in the same district as a TEM+ site at relatively limited incremental cost with the expectations of comparable results. Finally, over the past four years, TEM+ has a demonstrated history of health impact with the ability to reliably replicate the approach to deliver health impact.  TEM+ provides a benchmark for investments desiring to measure the efficiency of their investment in terms of cost per beneficiary, CYP, adolescent reached. These projections serve as a measure of efficiency for the project investment, but also to forecast the cost of achieving the ambitious FP2020 targets if TEM+ was scaled to close the gap of 34% mCPR.</p>",

It is even  more alarming  to note is that among those clients who turned for contraceptive service less than 7% took IUCD as their preferred modern contraceptive despite its long couple years of protection, being non-hormonal and safe for most women of reproductive age. It is suspected that this is due to several reasons ranging from the knowledge and skill gap of most service providers on insertion, fear of undressing before service providers among others. Based on the fact that cervical cancer is a crowd puller and IUCD is inserted through the same cervix that is being screened, the integration of cervical cancer and provision of LARC especially IUCD based on well informed free choice could make provision of IUCD easier and more acceptable. By promoting a LARC method this way, access is increased, clients visit to facilities is reduced and the approach might prove to be cost effective and increase clients’ satisfaction.  It is on this background that RHU come up with a strategy to increase the uptake of IUCD by integrating cervical cancer screening with provision of contraceptive methods",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "•\tThe program did a need assessment study, discussed, and analyzed the findings and come up with strategies. •\tThen piloted the integration during some outreaches and camps in different sites and found it cost effective and applicable.•\tThe program trained the RHU staffs and mentored on both provision of LARC and Cervical cancer screening. •\tReporting tools were developed, and staff were trained and oriented on how to use them.•\tThe integration rolled out in all service delivery points and sites  •\tFollow up to ascertain whether the integration had increased the uptake of IUCD through a survey.",
      "methodology": "A cross sectional study was conducted in Apac District for six months among women of reproductive age (15-49years) to find out whether integrating family planning services into cervical cancer screening services will improve the IUCD uptake. A participant size of 6000 women of reproductive age was set for the study.  The sites of the study were selected using random sampling. Pre-visits were conducted in 2 outreach sites to pretest the tools. The tools were adjusted for identified the gaps.  Data was collected using integrated daily register both at the static, outreaches and in camps. Clients’ views were captured through client exit interviews. A survey was also conducted to do mid assessment and at the end of the study to capture all clients’ views and the impact of the project on the clients, service providers and the organization.",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "7 out of 10 women interviewed reported that they found it easier, convenient and more confidential to get an IUCD inserted during the screening process as nobody will know that they got both screening and IUCD hence protecting them from the domestic violence some of them have been experiencing if their men noticed they went for contraceptives.0ver 84% of the respondents reported to be fully satisfied with the integration of cervical cancer screening, other SRH services and provision of modern contraceptives as it makes it easier for a client to access variety of services in one go and at the same site saving them not only the time but also money spent on transportation.The facility IUCD uptake has increased by  55% as more women coming for  cervical cancer services are also counseled and initiated on FP especially IUCD after comprehensive counseling  where full and complete information about all the available contraceptive options  is given and clients  are allowed to make  a informed  choices. This has not only benefited the clients but also the facility which has witness a 35% reduction on the cost for offering both services as fuel and others supplies save due to integration.",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "•\tIntegration is cost effective as some supplies, airtime for mobilization  and fuel are used only once during the  integrated service provision  for all the services as opposed to parallel programs where these resources are not shared and used independently  .•\tIntegration of services help improves the mobilization of clients as clients different and various needs are put into perspective, as opposed to programs that only handle one SRH issue. Hence different clients will come for various services.•\tIntegrating poorly demanded and  stigmatized  services like FP with highly demanded and culturally accepted services  like cervical screening may help improve the uptake as indicated by this study where the  uptake of IUCD increased by 55% due to integration into cervical cancer screening programs that are highly demanded, as it provides opportunity to meet a large number of clients to health educate, dispel myths , counsel and provide FP services to those who were undecided and those with unmet needs of contraceptive. •\tIntegration improves clients satisfaction as the clients get variety of the services at one go and the same site without other extra costs. •\tIntegrated counseling empowers the clients with the variety of SRH information that they go home with to share with their family members and neighbors.",

      "title": "Integration of cervical cancer prevention services into an existing family planning program in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Cervical cancer (CC) is a major cause of premature death and disability, despite being highly preventable. Women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) account for 85% of all CC cases globally, largely due to a lack of CC prevention services. Notably many of these same countries have a high unmet need for family planning (FP). In Uganda, CC is the leading cause of female cancer deaths. In addition, 33% of Ugandan women have an unmet need for modern contraception. Identifying effective strategies to deliver a comprehensive basket of sexual and reproductive health services (SRH) to women across their life course is a shared priority among program implementers and policy makers.</p><p>Population Services International, (PSI), through its local affiliate, the Programme for Accessible Health, Communication and Education (PACE) launched CC prevention services in 2012 through its national franchise network of private sector clinics. <em>ProFam </em>clinics offer a package of SRH services, including family planning (FP) consultations. Women presenting for FP consultations who meet WHO’s target age range, 30-49 years, are offered same-day CC screening using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and cryotherapy, as indicated. Conversely, women presenting for CC services are made aware of other SRH services offered.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To identify temporal trends in service uptake once CC prevention services were integrated within the <em>ProFam </em>network, the PACE team conducted a multi-year review of services uptake among all female clients accessing FP and CC services within clinics offering these services in the network.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>All <em>ProFam</em> client intake forms were collected, reviewed for completeness, and data manually input into PACE’s internal management information systems (MIS) database on an ongoing basis. Investigators reviewed all FP and CC service data between 2015-2017. Individual services accessed and corresponding age categories were compiled to identify trends in service uptake among women attending <em>ProFam </em>clinics during the period under review. FP services data were disaggregated by contraceptive method for each year. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Between 2015-2017, a total of 214 <em>ProFam</em> clinics offered both CC and FP services. A  total of 306,318 women received a contraceptive method through the <em>ProFam</em> network; of those, 145,291 (47%) also received CC screen and treat services.</p><p>When uptake of multiple services was stratified by contraceptive method, the highest proportion of CC service uptake was among women who opted for intrauterine devices (IUD), followed by implants (Table 1). This trend was consistent over time.</p><p>Age has been cited as a concern when integrating CC and FP services, as the ideal target audiences may vary. In PACE’s program data, among women who took up both CC and FP services, the age category varied by contraceptive method. For women who chose either tubal ligation or IUD, the median age category was 30-34 years. The median age range among women who chose either short-term methods or implants was 25-29 years. These findings were consistent across the 3-year period.</p><p>Table 1.

      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>These data highlight that Integration of CC prevention services and FP services is both feasible and desirable among Ugandan women. These multi-year data highlight favorable temporal trends for integrated service delivery. First, the program has been able to maintain consistent uptake for multiple services across several years. Integrated services are largely driven by women who chose either permanent methods or IUD provision as their contraceptive method of choice. Integration of CC ‘screen and treat’ services is particularly convenient in this context, since it can performed as a combined procedure. This trend is also important in light of recent evidence which suggests that IUD use may reduce cervical cancer risk. While concerns exist that these services may be inefficient since they target different age groups, these data highlight a consistency in CC screening uptake by method, offering providers an opportunity to tailor SRH services according to women’s needs and desires.</p><p></p><p></p>",

      "title": "Integration of contraceptive services into cardiovascular disease management improves access to and uptake of long-acting reversible contraception.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, including among women of reproductive age. Risks of maternal morbidity and mortality are increased in women with chronic diseases, especially those with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These women face increased risk of pregnancy-associated maternal and fetal complications. Therefore, they require individualized counseling and access to highly-effective contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy. One strategy to decrease unplanned pregnancy is expand access to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), including subdermal contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs). LARC are the most effective reversible methods and do not contain estrogen, therefore having few contraindications for women with CVD. While LARC use has significantly increased in developed countries, in sub-Saharan Africa, uptake is still low. Reasons for this include patient, partner, provider, and health systems level barriers. One strategy to address these barriers is the integration of contraceptive services into HIV care and other medical services. The resulting outcomes have been promising, but none have specifically addressed women with CVD. For women with CVD, the anticoagulation management clinic (AMC) is an important point of care where patients have long-term continuity, creating the optimal service delivery point for an integrated care model.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objective of our study was to evaluate outcomes after implementation of a model of care for the integration of contraceptive services into an existing Anticoagulation Management Clinic (AMC). All women of reproductive age from AMC were referred for integrated services and all women receiving integrated services were offered enrollment in our study for the purpose of collecting program evaluation data, with no control group.  Our primary aim was to compare the use of LARC among this cohort of women prior to and after receiving integrated services. We hypothesized that receiving integrated services would increase the proportion of women using LARC. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We performed a prospective observational study of reproductive-age women referred for integrated services from AMC at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital from March 2015 to March 2016. Women who had previously underwent sterilization, were non-reproductive (having had a hysterectomy or being postmenopausal) or desired to become pregnant within one year were excluded. Baseline characteristics and contraceptive method use were obtained via in-person survey at enrollment. Initial counseling was performed by a nurse experienced in FP and included information on the importance of planning a pregnancy and individualized counseling about medically-appropriate contraceptive methods. Written information was provided to discuss contraception and specific methods with partners. The integrated services, including same-day LARC initiation when medically appropriate, were provided free of charge. Available methods include the copper intrauterine device, etonorgestrel and levonorgestrel subdermal contraceptive implants, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injectable contraception, progestin-only contraceptive pills, condoms, and counseling about natural FP.</p><p>Outcomes at 3 months post-enrollment were obtained by participant report via in-person or telephone survey. To evaluate LARC use prior to and 3 months post-intervention we used the inference on proportions test. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine individual factors related to uptake of LARC.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Of the 322 reproductive age women actively attending AMC during the study period, 232 (72%) were screened for inclusion after being referred for integrated services. Of the 190 participants enrolled, 3-month outcome data is available for 171 (90%), all of whom were included in final analysis.</p><p>There was a statistically significant increase in LARC use from 15.2% at baseline to 28.1% 3 months after enrollment (84.9% increase, p=0.004). This was primarily due to an increase in contraceptive implant use from 9.9% to 18.7% (88.9% increase, p=0.020), and a non-statistically significant increase in IUD use from 5.3% to 9.4% (77.4% increase, p= 0.146). There was a significant increase in the use of DMPA from 13.5% to 24.0% (77.8% increase, p=0.013). No method use or abstinence significantly decreased from 57.3% to 38.6% (32.6% decrease, p<p>Of note, there was a significant increase in the proportion of women who discussed contraception with their partner (73% at baseline to 88% at 3 months post-enrollment, p=0.012), and 78% reported that their partner was supportive of their contraceptive use. There was no difference in LARC use based on indication for anticoagulation with the most common indications for anticoagulation being VTE (54%) and valvular heart disease (36%), most often due to RHD.</p><p>In logistic regression analysis, younger age, having at least one child, and discussing family planning with a partner were predictive of LARC use. </p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results from this study highlight several key findings related to the integration of FP services into care for women with chronic disease. With an almost 50% rate of previous unplanned pregnancy in our study population, and over half desiring no future childbearing, there is an indication of a large unmet need for highly effective contraceptive methods and the importance of availability of highly effective reversible contraceptive methods.  </p><p>Our study shows that a model of care integrating contraceptive counseling and provision into anticoagulation management services is an effective strategy to improve LARC and highly effective contraceptive use among women with cardiovascular disease. We believe that the increase in highly effective contraceptive use observed in our study is attributable to the integrated care model designed and implemented with pre-implementation planning and stakeholder buy-in to develop targeted solutions for identified barriers. This reinforces previous evidence that integration strategies must address multi-level barriers to improve access to and acceptability of effective contraception. Importantly, we also demonstrated the importance of engagement of male partners in improving use of effective contraception. This model of care may be utilized in other health care settings to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality among this high-risk population. </p><p>Our study had several limitations which may reduce generalizability.  We were unable to recruit the entire population of AMC patients despite referring all women of reproductive to this service.  It is possible that there may be important differences between the women who enrolled and those who did not, thus overestimating the impact of this service. </p><p></p>",

      "title": "Integration of family planning into fistula care at prevention and treatment sites in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Obstetric fistula, a complication of obstructed or prolonged labor, has devastating effects on the lives of women. Although solid prevalence data for Uganda is lacking, the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey reported a prevalence rate of 2% of women experiencing fistula in Uganda, with approximately 140,000–200,000 women living with fistula and about 1,900 new cases occurring annually. EngenderHealth, with funding from USAID, has provided fistula prevention and treatment at four treatment and 14 prevention sites in six districts in Uganda. Two of the treatment sites, Kitovu and Kamuli Mission Hospitals, are Catholic-founded. Family planning (FP) is a known strategy for fistula prevention for women and more important for those treated for fistula. FP prevents fistula by delaying early childbearing and in settings where access to quality obstetric care is limited. FP offers adequate time to women treated for fistula for full healing and planning for a desired pregnancy and make future childbearing plans. Among women who have attained their desired family size, FP prevents unintended pregnancies. Health facilities are key service points for integrating FP for women affected by obstetric fistula and for those at risk for it</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>At prevention facilities, the program provided FP as part of a minimum package of care in immunization sessions, outpatient care, pediatric wards, antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics, and postnatal wards, as well as providing counseling and contraceptives at fistula treatment sites during fistula camps. FP information and counseling were also included during preoperative and postoperative fistula care and referral for FP methods were available at discharge and at the three-month follow-up visit. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>On-site training and mentoring and coaching of health workers on FP skills and the of concept integration was conducted in maternal and child health, outpatient departments, pediatric wards, community, and HIV/ART departments at two regional referral hospitals and seven health centers. Mentorship also covered practical tasks in client mobilization and recruitment for FP. Forty-eight health workers from 29 health facilities in six districts were trained on comprehensive FP clinical skills, which also included integration. Two models of integration were employed: integration in the same room at different service points where clients are counseled and provided with FP methods, and intra-facility referral, where after counseling, clients are referred to the FP clinic to receive their methods of choice. At Kitovu and Kamuli Mission Hospitals, staff orientations and FP updates were done for 20 health workers to enable them to provide client-centered counseling on FP and to establish referral networks to facilities where clients could receive modern contraceptives of their choice. Reorganization of the health facilities was done to enhance smooth client flow and to promote clients’ right to privacy. Integration into fistula surgical camps was done by trained FP providers and included FP messages in routine fistula pre- and postoperative counseling</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Following the FP clinical skills training in May 2017 for health workers from supported facilities in Kasese, Masaka, and Kalungu, FP service uptake increased from 3,297 (March-May 2017) to 3,829 (June-August 2017) clients; 44% of clients took up short-acting methods, 54% long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), and 3% permanent methods.</p><p>During the two fistula camps held at Jinja RRH between July-September 2016 and January-March 2017, a total of 37 repaired clients took up FP methods following the fistula repair.</p><p>In Jinja, from March-June to August-November 2017, the number of FP clients increased from 586 to 668 (12.2%) after training, with 24.6% adopting LARCs and 75.4% short-acting contraceptives. </p><p>There was also a 12.1% increase in total clients in Kamuli five months after training, from 1,879 (February-June 2017) to 2,137 (August-December 2017), with 77.1% adopting short-acting methods and 22.9% LARCs.</p><p>Kamuli Mission established a FP Clinic and 1259 clients counselled and referred for FP methods. Kitovu counselled and referred 26 clients </p><p>In Hoima after training, the number of FP clients increased by 6.2%, from 2,959 (April-July 2017) to 3,156 (September-December 2017), with 79% adopting short-acting methods and 20.9% LARCs. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Integration takes more than training people to provide FP. It means involving stakeholders (including the community) to identify needs for integrated services. It involves looking at multiple service delivery systems and assessing their capacity, then identifying the changes that need to be made to achieve and sustain integration.</p><p>Task shifting, as opposed to task sharing, provides an effective solution for the shortage of professional health personnel to reduce missed opportunities at lower level facilities. Capacity building of nursing assistants helped to bridge the gap through provision of LARCs.</p><p>The high- risk pregnancy concept (too early; too late; too many and too late pregnancies) was a useful key entry point to introducing FP methods to clients.</p><p>Using MOH’s FP logistics system to address the contraceptive needs at lower level health centres III and II was useful.</p><p>On-site mentoring, sharing of data, and reports review enhanced self-motivation by health workers to improve on records and data management, but also helped to demystify rumors by health workers to change their attitudes towards FP. </p>",

      "title": ": Investment Case for Scaling Up Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health and Family Planning Interventions to Save Lives of Mothers and Children in South Africa",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Major progress has been made towards reducing maternal, neonatal and child mortality in South Africa (SA), although some global maternal, neonatal and child (MNCH) targets have not been met. Many women and children continue to die from preventable causes, mainly resulting from structural limitations within the health system affecting the quality health care.  To address these barriers, several recommendations have been made by the three inter-ministerial committees on health in SA. These range from improvements in the quality of healthcare through knowledge development and healthcare workers training, to strengthening community involvement in the provision of care and increasing coverage of key reproductive and MNCH interventions. However, cost-effective interventions that could be scaled up to reduce still-births, maternal, neonatal and child mortality by 2020 and 2030 have not been identified.</p><p>This MNCH investment case modelling provides useful insight into interventions that should be prioritized to meet targets set in the sustainable development goals and the level of extra resources required to scale up these interventions. For this abstract only Family Planning (FP) modelling results will be presented.</p><p></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Which cost effective MNCH interventions, when scaled up, can assist the country to reach SDG 3.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study uses the Lives saved Tool(List) and the FP (FamPlan) model to model the impact of scaling up MNCH interventions and contraceptive prevalence rates. The LiST projects the mortality outcomes in a target year which coverage of essential interventions is scaled up from baseline year (2016) to the target year (2020 or 2030) based on the following scenarios:</p>\t<li><strong>Realistic coverage:</strong> LiST interventions were scaled up to achievable coverage levels by 2020. Achievable coverage levels were elicited from SA MNCH experts during a panel review meeting.</li>\t<li><strong>Full coverage:</strong> Interventions were scaled up to full capacity (99% coverage) by 2030. This is an inspirational and allows identification of interventions that can be prioritized to meet SGD 3 targets by 2030</li><p>The two scenarios used an expected annual increase of 0.3% which is based on the CPR changes observed in SA between 1998 and 2003.</p><p>The FamPlan examines the impact of changing contraceptive prevalence and method mix. The module requires inputs on total fertility, contraceptive prevalence, method mix, and proportion of women of reproductive age in a sexual union, duration of postpartum insusceptibility, abortion rates and degree of pathological sterility. Scenarios used:  </p><ul>\t<li>CPR increases by 0.5%</li>\t<li>CPR increases by 1%</li></ul>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Scaling up MNCH interventions from their baseline coverage to realistic coverage levels by 2020 (Annual increase of 0.3%) can reduce maternal mortality ratio by 33%, neonatal mortality rate by 18%, under five mortality rate by 26% and stillbirth rate by 18%. When FP is scaled up annually by 0.5%, total number of deaths averted increase by 7% and 20% when CPR is scaled up annually by 1%.</p><p>Scaling up interventions to full coverage by 2030 (and an annual CPR increase of 0.3%) results in higher mortality reductions. Maternal mortality ratio decreased by 54%, neonatal mortality rate by 28%, under five mortality rate by 41% and still birth rate by 24%. When FP is scaled up from an annual increase of 0.3% to an annual increase of 0.5-1%, the total number of deaths averted increase by 14-36%.  </p><p>Approximately 22% of maternal deaths estimated in 2016 can be averted by 2030 if contraceptive prevalence is scaled up annually by 1%. Similar reductions can be expected for neonates (44%), children under five (27%) and stillbirths (49%). Under full coverage the cost of MNCH interventions will reduce by 3% from US$7.1 billion to US$ 6.9 billion if CPR increases by 0.5% and by 9% to US$6.4 billion if CPR increases by 1%.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This model allows countries to identify interventions that can be scaled up to achieve SDG 3 and most importantly assist countries to tangibly set targets towards achievement of SDGs.  Of note is that confirmation that FP is one of the key interventions that would save lives across all groups and efforts to increase the contraceptives prevalence rate should be made. However, there are a number of barriers that lead to low contraceptive prevalence rate. These include concerns regarding the side effects and opposition by partners, entrenched traditional views on abstinence, inadequate procedures and poor skills required for provision of family planning. Efforts should be made to family planning services that are accessible to all populations, particularly adolescents.  </p>",

      "title": "Business Case for Investing in Family Planning in Nigeria 2018 to 2020 – Cost benefit analysis",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Nigeria has an estimated population of 192 million (NPoPC 2017 estimates) and with the growth rate of 3.2%, the population will double in 22 years. It is also among the top ten countries in the world when it comes to maternal mortality. With an estimated 36,000 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth in 2013, Nigeria accounted for almost 13% of the global maternal death burden and about 30% of these prevented deaths can be averted by improving access to family planning services and commodities (Guttmacher 2012).</p><p>The Contraceptives Funding Basket fund was established in 2011 for procurement of contraceptives for the public health sector with donors’ contributions from Canadian Government, UK Government, UNFPA and the counterpart contribution from the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the MDG budget line from Federal Ministry of Health.</p><p>Nigeria is faced with financial uncertainty on the sustainability of the Basket Fund largely due to failure of Federal Government of Nigeria to regularly make its own contributions of US$3 million annually and the situation could be even worse if the funding from the donors stops with potential dire consequences for the sustainability of distribution of FP commodities in the country</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The dependency nature of FP basket fund on unstainable donor funding without predictability for longer term financing is a weakness that a sustainability and investment plan will help to overcome. It was therefore imperative that a financial sustainability plan is developed, hinged on making an investment case to governments at all levels in Nigeria and to development partners on funding of FP commodities. This plan is expected to mobilize sustainable and adequate funds for FP from domestic resources and help address other health system issues that are relevant to significantly and equitably increasing the prevalence of FP use in Nigeria.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Donors and governments face a number of questions as they strive to improve the allocation of limited resources to provide essential health services including the below: How much would it cost so that women have healthy, planned pregnancies, to prevent deaths among women and newborns, and increase their ability to lead healthier, more productive lives? How would these benefits compare with those of other health investments? The framework of the development of The Business Case for investment in Family Planning followed the following steps using a desk review methodology on interventions and costs of the FP Program from 2011 to 2016. Data was collected from Federal Ministry of Health, State Governments, Donors and Implementing Partners using Key Informant Interviews and a variety of tools for quantitative data. The Marie Stopes Impact tool was used to estimate the Couple Year Protection and model the impact. i. A situational analysis including identifying the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) through a desk review and qualitative data collection using Key Informant Interviews. ii. Critically appraisal of strategic and sustainable options for financial sustainability of FP in Nigeria iii. Development of the Business Case for FP in Nigeria iv. Recommending economically viable strategies with value for money</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The National Health Accounts for 2010 to 2014 indicates that average percentage of total expenditure on reproductive health compared to recurrent expenditures on health was 8.86% with about US$2.86 billion spent in this period on reproductive health. However about 63.4% of these total expenditure on reproductive health was household expenditure while Government expenditure was 21.4% and donor expenditure was 13.6%. This reinforces a need to increase Government investments at national and state levels in health insurance to ensure family planning expenses are reimbursable in private and public sector and relieving the burden on families. The desk review indicated that total cost of investment in contraceptives by Government and donors from 2011 to 2016 was US$64.491 million which has potential of savings to Government of US$828 million – thirteen fold return on investment. At this level, the contraceptives has potential to prevent 4.1 million unintended pregnancies and avert over 25,000 maternal deaths - due to lower MCH service utilization. The report estimates the costs, impacts and financing scenarios to achieve the modern contraceptive prevalence goals and impact on development. To reach the CPR target by 2020, Nigeria requires US$652 million dollars over the next five years to invest in high-impact family planning interventions including contraceptives. This investment would have enormous benefits: estimated US$1.40 would be saved on maternal and newborn health care for every dollar invested in family planning and another US$ 4 would be saved on treating complications of unplanned pregnancies resulting in 30,000 maternal deaths, 5.19 million unplanned pregnancies averted and cost saving US$1.02 billion</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>The Government of Nigeria has recognized the need for increased domestic financial investments and has established national and sub-national strategies to increase access and demand for family planning, many of these strategies were insufficient to address the projected gap. As such, the defined next steps and resource mobilization strategies in this document will be taken into consideration by Government for planning from 2018 -2020.</p><p>The immediate action from Government was an increase in the annual commitment from US$3 million to US$4 million. It is also critical to continue dedicated advocacy efforts to Federal and State Government to ensure budget lines for FP Programming including distribution are adequately funded and funds released</p>",

      "title": "Tanzania’s Largest Health Insurer Covers Family Planning:  An evidence-based advocacy success story",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Tanzania has supportive policies that uphold provision of voluntary family planning services to all who need them. However, progress has been slow. Over the past 15 years, the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) grew by 1% annually, from 22% in 2005 to 32% in 2015, while total fertility rate stagnated at an average of six children per woman. Attaining the national mCPR target of 45% by 2020 means activating critical partners, such as private health insurers.</p><p>Insurance companies in Tanzania typically do not cover family planning (FP) because the government already funds many FP-related costs. However, while costs of FP commodities from the public sector are covered, consultations services and administering FP methods are not leading to out-of-pocket expenses.  These in turn, create a substantial financial burden for many women, preventing them from accessing services.</p><p>Beginning in 2013, the Advance Family Planning (AFP) advocacy initiative engaged private insurance companies in Tanzania to strengthen coverage for family planning services.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>AFP, a project advocating for increased funding and improved policy environment for family planning in Tanzania engaged the management of Tanzania’s leading health insurance company, AAR, by demonstrating the benefits of investing in family planning by incorporating the service into their health benefit package and other health-related programs.</p><p>Simultaneously, AFP partners investigated the costs of providing a woman with  a  full  range  of  short-  and  long-acting  modern  contraceptive methods per year.</p><p>Based on evidence presented, AAR management was able to see the costs it was incurring annually for maternal and child health services from its clients’ premiums.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>AFP conducted a rapid assessment to gather data on costs of maternal and child health based on AAR’s medical expenditures records of previous three years (2013 to 2015). The data showed that AAR’s maternal and child health costs were high and rising. For instance, in 2013, $10 out of every $100 in total claim costs incurred by AAR were maternal  health  costs.  By  2015,  those  costs  rose  to  $13. AAR technical team’s own analysis of the company’s expenditures for newborn delivery care also showed a notable rise in costs, from 1.7 billion Tanzanian shillings (Tshs.) in 2013 to 2.1 billion Tshs.  in 2015.  </p><p>Comparatively, the  costs  to provide contraceptive methods ranged  from  less  than  one  to  nine  US  dollars  (500  to  20,000  Tshs.)  per  woman.  With these relatively minimal expenditures, AAR could invest in the provision of FP services and alleviate the growing burden of maternal and newborn health costs among insured groups.</p><p>Evidence packaged in power point presentations and policy briefs, anchored policy dialogues with AAR’s management to solicit support for inclusion of FP in their health benefit package. Initially, AFP advocacy resulted in AAR’s intermim move to incorporate FP information and services in its Wellness  Services program. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In May 2016, AAR management, for the first time, included FP in its health benefit package to the tune of 300,000 Tshs. ($138) annually per client. AAR clients have since been able to access modern methods in any of its 263 accredited health facilities in the country. AAR analysis over the past two years already attests to an upward growth of corporate clients who have enrolled to access the product and those utilizing the service.</p><p>The number of corporations who registered for the package with family planning coverage grew from 35 in 2016 to 119 in March 2018, while those utilizing the service increased from 25 to 70 during the same period signifying the need for intensifying FP demand creation outreach activities. In this respect,  AAR anticipates greater increase in the number of corporations enrolling and utilizing the service for the rest of 2018 and beyond.</p><p>In addition, AAR’s Wellness Services Program  incorporated a FP component in January 2016. AAR  Wellness  Services  is  an  outreach  program  for corporate  clients  that  offers  information,  education, and communication on a broad range of health-related issues  to  various  corporate  clients  in  Tanzania.  The program  has grown by almost five-folds, with the number of individuals from 145 in 2016 to 645 in March 2018. Under this program, communities reached include women’s groups in hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>AAR’s proactive participation in promoting family planning information, education and services using its own resources has opened doors for collaboration with non-traditional partners such as CSOs as family planning implementers.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>AAR’s move to include family planning in its health benefit package and community outreach program expands the resource base for FP and contributes to country efforts to increase access to the services. Over time, AAR’s investment in family planning will not only accelerate reduction of maternal, newborn and child deaths, but also minimize costs that the company incurs in maternal and child health services to its clients.</p><p>AAR also demonstrates the potential of insurance sector in financing family planning services. Lessons from this initiative were shared with other private and public health insurance companies. For example, this year the National Health Insurance Fund has embarked on expanding access to FP information through its “Going Rural Program.” These efforts would certainly  stimulate demand for these services and facilitate users in making informed decision.</p><p>Successful advocacy with AAR shows that there is potential for support from insurers and corporations. The evidence-based argument linking  family  planning  to  reducing  costs  can  be used as a model when reaching out to other private companies.</p>",

      "title": "The Investment Case for Family Planning in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uganda has registered significant progress in family planning utilization over the years, with modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) increasing from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 34.8 percent in 2016. During the same period, unmet need for family planning declined marginally from 35% to 28.4%. The Uganda National Development Plan II recognizes family planning as a key factor in poverty reduction if the country is to achieve middle income country status by 2040. In 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and partners developed a family planning costed implementation plan (2015–2020) that details the country’s ambitious efforts to reduce unmet need for family planning to 10 percent and increase the mCPR amongst married and women in union to 50 percent by 2020. The total cost of implementing the plan is 235 million USD with an annual investment of about 39 million USD. In the last three years, the total annual investment by government and its development partners has not reached the planned target of 39 million USD thereby threatening realization of FP2020 goals.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To demonstrate why it is important to increase investment in family planning in Uganda, UNFPA in partnership with MOH, the National Population Council and Partners in Population and Development developed an investment case in 2017.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We used ImpactNow - an Excel-based model developed by the USAID funded Health Policy Project and Marie Stopes International to estimate maternal deaths and unintended pregnancies averted, financial savings to the healthcare system and benefits of method switching based on three policy scenarios;</p><ul>\t<li>Conservative or business as usual scenario where we used the UDHS 2011 and 2016 incremental percentages for modern family planning methods to determine the method mix and fixed the mCPR at 44%;</li>\t<li>Moderate scenario; where the method mix remained as in the conservative scenario but with the  mCPR of 50% as per target set in the family planning costed implementation plan;</li>\t<li>Ambitious scenario; where we maintained mCPR at 50% but reduced the median age for long acting and reversible contraceptives (LARCs) i.e. from 34 to 30 years and from 30 -25 years for IUDs and implants respectively. We also increased the share of LARCs in the total method mix (from 6.72% to 9.13% and from 25.90% to 33.7% for IUDs and implants respectively) while reducing the share of short term methods in the total method mix (from 51.9% to 41.1% and 5.57% to 4.46% for injectables and oral contraceptives respectively).</li></ul><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The results of the model show that, If Uganda chooses the business as usual scenario, mCPR would rise up to 44% whereas unmet need would reduce from 28% to 19% by 2020. As a result, 2,819,410 unintended pregnancies and 5,396 maternal deaths would be averted coupled with USD 102 million saved in health costs. To achieve these results, government and partners would need to invest USD 105 million in family planning. With the moderate scenario, mCPR is projected to increase to 50% by 2020 whereas unmet need would reduce from 28% to 13% and USD 113 million would be required for investment over a six-year period. This would avert 3,112,480 unintended pregnancies and 5,942 maternal deaths, and USD 111 million would be saved in health costs. If an ambitious scenario is chosen, mCPR is projected to rise to 50% whereas unmet need for family planning would reduce from 28% to 13% at a cost of USD 109 million over the same period. This would avert 3,359,152 unwanted pregnancies and 6,400 maternal deaths, and save the country USD 120 million in health costs.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Results from the model demonstrate that, government would reap more benefits in family planning and achieve FP2020 targets in time if it opted for strategic interventions that increase the share of LARCs while reducing short term methods in the total method mix and lowering the median age at which women of reproductive age start using LARCs. This should go hand in hand with increased annual budget allocations of at least USD 18 million dedicated to family planning programs. Such investment will accelerate fertility and mortality decline, contribute significantly to the desired population structure changes leading to long-term, socioeconomic development and achievement of the demographic dividend. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Kenya has a favourable policy and legal frameworks that promote adolescent SRHR with the 2015 ASRHR Policy aimed at enhancing Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) status of adolescents by advocating for provision of ASRH services in Youth Friendly Services (YFS) centres. Despite good policies and interventions, young people in Kenya continue to experience poor SRHR outcomes status. Bungoma County is one of the most populated counties with 34% of the population are young people age 10-24 years. Recent studies indicate that many youths are aware of the SRH services but are not accessing resulting in poor SRHR indicators like; teenage pregnancy (18 %), female genital cutting (FGC) at 11 % (2014) among adolescent girls and early marriages; 7 % of females are married by age 15 and 28 % by age 18 with about one in four adolescent married girls 23% had an unmet need for family planning. Many of young people also cite; openness of the facility, unfavourable operating hours in YFS centres, long waiting hours for services, cost of service,  stigmatising posters, negative attitude towards health providers and lack of confidentiality among service providers and negative perceptions towards contraceptives and STIs as the reasons for  not accessing SRH services.  </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objective was to test the effect and feasibility of a low-cost approach on access and uptake of SRH services among young people in Bungoma County by exploring the effect of proposed interventions on access and uptake of the SRH services among young people. This was six month pilot project under the SRHR Alliance that aimed at increasing access and uptake of SRH services in YFS centres attached to five selected healthcare facilities by extending hours of YFS operation; Awareness creation in schools and communities; capacity building of service providers and peer educators, renovation of YFS centres.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study was done in Bungoma County within the communities around where the selected pilot health facilities. A randomized control trial design was applied in 10 health facilities (5 intervention sites and 5 control sites) which were in different Sub Counties far apart from one another. A sample of 800 (400 Baseline and 400 End line) young people aged 12-24 years were selected at the household level, living around 10 facilities using systematic random sampling. In addition observations for the existence and status of YFS centres in health facilities were done physically by research team. Quantitative data collected using structured questionnaire which was triangulated with qualitative data captured through FGDs, KIIs and observations to yield plausible results. 6 FGDs of 10-12 young people per group were conducted (3 at baseline and 3 at end line). Regression analysis was run for the index score calculated using variables for access and uptake of services against predictors; wave (intervention and control group), age, sex, marital status, school status, motivated level of providers and, extended hours of YFS operation to establish their effect on index score.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The median age of the respondents was at 19 years in the intervention and 18 years in the control at baseline and 19 for both groups at the end line. Young people from the intervention area had a higher median score of access and uptake of SRH services (66.7) in comparison with baseline results which was at 50 for both intervention and control, than from the control at the end line. There was increased uptake in the level of access to SRH services at late hours compared to the baseline in the intervention group. Majority (87.5%) of the young people who visited the YFS centres reported that they could recommend for their age mates to come for SRH services at the YFS centres. The qualitative data, indicated at end line in the intervention sites that service providers are now friendly and provide adequate counseling before they are given services.  The capacity building and motivation of health care providers and peer providers provided an excellent friendly services to young people in the intervention sites. A significant proportion of young people interviewed at the end line in intervention sites revealed that YFS centres have contributed positively to their SRH status. YFS and peer providers were seen as a linkage of young people to SRH services in the health facilities including laboratory services. Extension of hours of operations in YFS centres contributed significantly to the reduction of stigma and negative perceptions among young people towards SRH services, providers and from the community members.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The study shows that increased uptake of SRH services by young people at late hours could help in increasing the uptake of SRH services thus reducing the unmet need of SRH services among young people.  Provision of well updated IEC material for SRH attracts and have educative messages to young people thus, make young people come for the services. Community outreaches play a pivotal role in providing SRH information and services and reducing stigma among young people in the community. There is need to engage policymakers to put in place structures to address the following; Inadequate health care staffing and deployment to YFS centres, Unstable supply of commodities to avoid shortages in the health facilities, waive fees for the laboratory services to young people in addressing SRH problems.  Introducing as specific budget line for setting up YFS centres in the health budgets and constant support supervision from county health management team will increase uptake and utilization of SRH services among young people.</p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Today's generation of young people is absolutely massive: Some 1.8 billion people are between ages 10 and 24. Most of them live in developing countries, often comprising a huge proportion of the population. In Ethiopian young people age 10 -24 years constitutes 33% of the total 102 million. Ethiopian youth, however, are confronted, among others, with a multitude of Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) problems caused by lack of adequate, accurate and appropriate access to SRHR information and services. Many young people particularly girls often are less informed, less experienced, and less comfortable accessing family planning and other reproductive health services than  boys. Young people may experience resistance or even hostility from adults when they attempt to obtain reproductive health information and services they need.  They rarely have opportunities to act as leaders or as advocates.  But when empowered and given the right opportunities, they are effective drivers of change. German Foundation for World Population (DSW) partners with young people, empowering them to participate in decisions affecting them, and support them to improve their SRHR and socio-economic status.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Youth-to-Youth Initiative (Y2Y) is a DSW youth empowerment program implemented in Ethiopia since 1999 and addressed more than 9 million youth. The Initiative works with Youth Clubs (in-school and out-of-school) targeting young people aged 10 to 24 years.  Key to the Y2Y Initiative is youth-owned youth clubs which serve as a social platform and means to strengthen young people's SRHR knowledge and skills. DSW strategies of empowerment include provision of SRHR information and services, capacity building and networking. This analysis examined the impact of youth empowerment program in the last four years on enhancing contraceptive uptake among young girls.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Four consecutive years (2014-2017) retrospective data of leadership training report and contraceptive utilization report of young girls and boys were used for the analysis. The trainees and service users were from four regions of Ethiopia; namely Oromia, Amhara, and Southern Nation and Nationalities and Addis Ababa. Data was obtained from the training center by type of training and gender and number of young girls who utilized contraceptive services was obtained from an existing project database. For this analysis, all the 800 youth leaders (427 boys and 373 girls) participated in leadership training in four consecutive years was considered. On the other hand, service utilization data of young girls for same age group and implementation years was also analyzed to see the impact of young girl leaders in promoting contraceptive services among their peers. This trend analysis is to assess the impact of empowering adolescent girls as leaders on enhancing contraceptive uptake. Therefore, empowering young girl leaders through SRHR leadership training was evaluated to have a positive impact with increased utilization of contraception among young girls. In this regard trends and descriptive analysis were presented and stratified by gender</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Between 2014 and 2017, 800 young people from four regions were trained on SRHR leadership, of which 47 % were girls. During the same period, 17,219 young girls used short acting contraceptive methods (Pills and Injectables). In the first year the percentage share of trained young leaders was only 28% where us those who used contraceptive methods were also low (2,198). The data show that girls are behind boys in leadership participation i.e the youth empowerment program disproportionally benefited boys than girls. However, the participation by gender over the years improved because of the emphasis on gender sensitive programming. The second year data shows 53 % of young girls participated in leadership training and as the same time contraceptive uptake among young girls increased by 36% as compared to the first year.  A dramatic change occured in 2016 where trained young girls accounted for 58 % and contraceptive uptake increased by 41 %. Finally, the fourth year (2017) has seen significant increase in contraceptive uptake (42.5%) and the percentage trained young girls (50%).  As the percentage share of young girls in leadership training change over the years, their contraceptive utilization has also showed dramatic increase. Thus, the trend analysis clearly showed substantial improvement in young girls’ contraceptive uptake suggesting that the program has been successful in empowering young girls to advocate for their SRHR particularly for improved access to contraceptive choices. In general, percentage of young girl leaders trained increased from 26 % in 2013 to 47 % in 2017.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The successful youth empowerment strategies used by DSW to increase contraceptive uptake among young girls through youth empowerment strategy can inform program worldwide.  Providing intensive training on leadership focusing on personal development and communication skills in a youth friendly environment coupled with on-site technical support improved young girls’ contraceptive uptake and their position in club leadership. This has also dramatically reduced the existing gender imbalance and challenged the belief that young girls may not be successful leaders. Besides these young girl leaders have become role models for younger adolescents who were shy voicing their concerns and ideas about issues affecting them. Some of them have emerged as champions in their communities, speaking out about youth friendly services, girls’ education and elimination of harmful traditional practices such as child and forced marriage. DSW’s experience indicates that youth leadership training program is an effective means of empowering young girls to advocate for youth friendly contraceptive service uptake, and playing leadership role in SRHR program in Ethiopia. In general, there is a great potential to increase contraceptive prevalence rate focusing on building the leadership skills of young girl leaders including their advocacy and communication skills. This program could potentially be replicated or adapted in other contexts where young girls are facing several barriers to contraceptive use, participation in leadership, and on other issues concerning their SRHR. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uganda has one of the youngest and most rapidly growing populations in the world with sustained high fertility and high adolescent pregnancy rates. One quarter of adolescents (15-19) have begun childbearing, and by age 19 over half (54%) are mothers or pregnant. Almost half (45%) of sexually active unmarried adolescents have an unmet need for contraceptives (Uganda Demographic Health Survey – UDHS 2016). Access barriers to contraceptive services are multiple and present on both the supply- and the demand side. </p><p>Health vouchers are not only a financing but also a programmatic tool to simultaneously reduce these barriers on both sides. Vouchers can overcome provider-related barriers such as anxiety to serve adolescents due to cultural context or potential parental disapproval. The voucher income motivates providers to tailor their services to the needs and wishes of adolescents; to deliver confidential quality sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services; and make their clinic youth-friendly. On the demand-side, vouchers help adolescents to overcome financial, informational, educational and cultural barriers through price reduction and face-to-face counselling during distribution. If required voucher distributors escort adolescents to the clinic. The paper voucher itself is a guarantee to the adolescent that they have a right to access services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Marie Stopes Uganda (MSU) operates a family planning (FP) voucher programme since 2011 to increase access to long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and permanent methods, targeting the poor and underserved communities. Vouchers can be used in any clinic of the BlueStar Social Franchise (SF) network of private providers. In 2014 MSU introduced ‘LinkUp’ vouchers for integrated HIV-SRH services, targeting youth (10-24) vulnerable to HIV/STI, redeemable in selected BlueStar clinics located near key populations. The LinkUp package provides HIV testing, STI management, and contraception. FP vouchers are sold at a symbolic fee while LinkUp vouchers are distributed for free.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>FP vouchers are implemented in all clinics of the BlueStar network, while 60 of the BlueStar clinics also participate in LinkUp.  FP vouchers are sold by community based distributors. LinkUp are distributed by youth from the community being targeted. LinkUp was amended, first in 2016 to shift focus to youth in need of contraceptives, and in 2017 to shift target group from <p>BlueStar providers fill a client service form for each voucher and paying client. Forms are collected monthly and data are entered into an electronic information management system. We used these routine service data to analyse trends in adolescents (aged 10-19) service uptake since 2011, including types of SRH services used; and user characteristics. We compared: 1) proportion of BlueStar clients being adolescent before and after the introduction of LinkUp and before and after the change in targeting age and 2) between clinics with and without LinkUp participation.</p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Between 100 and 450 clinics have been participating in the BlueStar network; starting with 100 clinics in 2011, expanding to 450 in 2014, and reducing to 240 in 2015 to increase quality and efficiency. From 2011 to 2017, almost 650,000 clients used BlueStar services. Around 75,000 were adolescents (10-19); mostly through an FP or LinkUp voucher, only 5% paid for services. Before LinkUp started 7% of clients were adolescents (9% in LinkUp clinics, 6% in non-LinkUp clinics). In the first three years of LinkUp-intervention the proportion of adolescents doubled in LinkUp-clinics (19%), while remaining the same (6%) in non-LinkUp clinics. When MSU shifted focus to adolescents and LinkUp target age to under 20, the proportion grew to 41% in LinkUp clinics and only slightly increased in non-LinkUp clinics (to 11%).  The absolute number of clients aged 20 or older in LinkUp clinics was not affected by the increase in adolescent clients and even increased slightly after LinkUp introduction. </p><p>Of the 15,000 LinkUp-adolescent voucher users in 2017, 95% were girls and 5% boys, mostly single (89%). The LinkUp voucher can be used multiple times for multiple services. On average, each LinkUp-voucher was used 2.3 times for a total of almost 35,000 consultations in 2017.  Among girls, 96% used vouchers for contraceptives services (71% LARC, 29% short-term methods). In addition, 64% of girls and 85% of boys accessed HIV testing (1.7% of girls tested positive, and 2.4% of boys), and 45% of girls and 47% of boys used voucher to access STI services.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The proportion of adolescent BlueStar clients before LinkUp was introduced was very low and remained low in non-LinkUp clinics. FP-vouchers did not result in increased adolescent uptake. When LinkUp was introduced the proportion doubled, and doubled again when voucher distributors started targeting youth under 20. The differences in proportions before and after voucher introduction in LinkUp and non-LinkUp clinics illustrate that highly subsidized services in quality clinics are insufficient to increase contraceptive uptake by adolescents. Adolescents are sensitive to targeting and respond well when invited and counselled personally by voucher distributors they trust. According to distributors, adolescents appreciate the paper voucher which guarantees their right to access services, making it unnecessary to explain reasons for visit. Furthermore, adolescents appreciate it when distributors escort them to clinics.</p><p>Adolescents in Uganda often mistakenly think that ‘FP’ services are only for married people; the integrated SRH services help to overcome this misconception. Most girls use their voucher for contraceptives in combination with other SRH services.  Of contraceptive users, almost three quarters preferred LARC, dispelling another common myth that youth only desire short-term methods. Most girls who used a LinkUp voucher were single, proof that vouchers can meet the needs of this difficult-to-reach group. Through the vouchers providers did overcome their initial fear for legal implications when serving adolescents. The Uganda experience shows that an integrated voucher package of SRH services explicitly targeted at adolescents can considerably accelerate uptake of contraceptive services and expand method mix among sexually active unmarried adolescents.</p>",

The study objectives were;-?To explore the socio-demographic characteristics of women who seek abortion services??-To determine the incidence and types of complications as a result of unsafe abortions??-To estimate the incidence of induced abortions in Malawi",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Unsafe abortion is a major public health concern for many developing countries and has been defined by World Health Organisation (WHO) as termination of an unintended pregnancy carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.</p><p>Unsafe abortion accounts for 13% of maternal mortality rates (MMR) in Africa. It is a major cause of MMR in Malawi.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A stratified random-sampling plan was used to select a nationally representative sample of health facilities that provided PAC services. The final sample included 166 facilities.  Of those, 93 were public facilities, 65 were run by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and 8 were private facilities. 97% of the selected facilities participated in the study.</p><p>Results were weighted to represent the national picture of women presenting for care in PAC facilities in Malawi.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Investments in adolescent health are paramount to achieving the SDGs. The Lancet writes: “Improving the physical, mental and sexual health of adolescents… at the cost of US$4.60 per person per year, could bring a 10-fold economic benefit by averting 12 million adolescent deaths and preventing 30 million unplanned pregnancies.”[1] Too often adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programs declare “youth-centeredness,” yet interventions are single-sectored, devoid of youth engagement, and ignore brain development and social environments.[2] Positive youth development (PYD) is an evidence-based approach that engages youth, their families, communities and governments so that youth are empowered to reach their full potential. PYD builds skills, assets and competencies; fosters healthy relationships; strengthens the environment; and transforms systems.[3] The Adolescent 360 (A360) project aims to increase access and uptake of modern contraceptives among girls 15-19 years in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania. PYD is an A360 guiding principle, where youth not only have a seat at the table but are equal to adults.</p> [1] The Lancet: Investing in adolescent health and education could bring 10-fold economic benefit; http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2017/lancet_education/en/<p>[2] <em>Our future: A Lancet commission on Adolescent Health &amp; Wellbeing</em>. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302593577_Our_future_A_Lancet_commission_on_adolescent_health_and_wellbeing.</p><p>[3] USAID’s YouthPower definition.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Through human centered design, A360 created three unique programs that prioritized PYD. A360 rejected the individual-only, single-sector perspective and instead focused on adolescents’ environment, development, non-health needs, and abilities. A360 hired a cultural anthropologist to ensure socio-ecological perspectives. In Tanzania and Nigeria, mothers participate at varying levels, tailored locally. In Ethiopia, the program is government-integrated for systems transformation. Our developmental scientist ensured age appropriateness and reinforced girls’ socio-emotional context. In Tanzania, younger girls benefit from family/community engagement while older girls receive direct services. In all three countries, A360 repositions contraception as an emotional decision helping girls achieve their goals today. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A360 field-testing began in June 2017 with six service sites in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania. Routine monitoring data, qualitative interviews, mystery client and exit survey data validate adopters, method uptake, client satisfaction, and provider quality. Data is also being collected on program components not directly related to adopters but that represent PYD approaches, including number of mothers/husbands/and community leaders reached; number of skills sessions offered; and qualitative stories from young people on program resonance. One example is the use of Pearson’s chi-square test to evaluate the association between husband involvement in Ethiopia’s counseling with contraception adoption. Across all three countries, A360 is reaching hard-to-reach girls across a wide spectrum: married and unmarried, with low to high education levels, with and without children, and across urban, peri-urban, and rural settings. Data has been analyzed and validated through January 2018, 88 service delivery points have been established and 11,630 girls (15-19 years old) have received relevant SRH information and the opportunity for an opt-out counselling moment with a provider. Of those reached, 4,813 of these girls took up a modern contraceptive method, 55% of which were a long-acting reversible methods (LARC). Data insights will inform further program adaptation at scale. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A360 meets all PYD features:</p><p>Build skills/competencies: Over 12,677 girls in Tanzania and Nigeria received entrepreneurship training. In Ethiopia, A360 built financial literacy of 1,041 young married couples. Nigeria builds negotiation skills and Tanzania teaches body literacy.</p><p>Healthy relationships: Tanzanian mothers and girls discuss challenging topics at clinics. Nigerian mothers group chat and Ethiopian husbands were integrated prompting 52% of couples to contracept.</p><p>Youth engagement: Youth supported formative research as surveyors and respondents. They shaped, piloted and evaluated prototypes. Youth were hired as mobilizers, mystery clients, designers and staff. Country youth strategies build ownership, skills and opportunities and set youth recruitment goals.</p><p>Belonging/membership: Girls created inspiring brands - championing interventions and fostering community through anthems, songs and online platforms. Localized brands define girls’ viewpoints. Tanzania’s Kuwa Mjanja “Be Smart” campaign redefined an old adage to “avoid boys” into one of empowerment. Their icon - a pineapple: “We stand tall; We wear crowns.”</p><p>Safe spaces: Safe physical, emotional and online spaces protect girls. Nigeria girls claimed to trust boyfriends “less than thieves” - prompting girl-only spaces. Facebook is monitored by medical experts.</p><p>Integrated youth friendly services: Stigma-free opt-out services are catalyzing method adoption in a single, brief contact. Ethiopia integrates using a baby calculator to pair relevant household costs (i.e. sack of grain) to childbearing. Tanzania aims to pilot in schools.</p><p>Positive norms/expectations: Ethiopia pairs youth with Health Extension Workers to serve young couples. Nigeria employs youth at their clinics. A360 inspires girls to dream, set goals and plan, before discussing contraception. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>A360 turns the traditional model of boardroom-based program design inside-out, putting <strong><em>youth voices at the center </em></strong><em>of research, activity design, quality, and monitoring</em>. Including youth not only makes them feel more connected—it holds us accountable. The project’s early results in contraceptive adoption are exceeding expectations and a PYD approach has influenced these high levels of rapid success. By fusing the principles of PYD with HCD, A360 is cracking the code in how to work <em>with</em> and <em>for </em>adolescents to solve their unique SRH needs together. A clear lesson is that this approach takes time, resources and a consistent effort to build untapped capacities. We continue to test creative ways to collaborate with adolescents to redefine the way SRH programs are designed, delivered, measured and evaluated. A360 is moving from an optimization phase to full scale and anticipates continued growth of outcome measures. However, success mandates blending the rigor of our efforts with the innovation of our solutions. Current optimization efforts are looking to deepen the workforce component in Tanzania through key private sector partnerships. Community engagement in Nigeria may need to be expanded to mutually advocate for improved adolescent SRH policies. And integration with slow moving government systems in Ethiopia may mean adjusting program goal posts. In all, A360’s PYD approach recognizes that having youth at the table as equal partners is the programmatic ingredient essential to not only reach A360 outcomes but ensure the sustainability and resonance of our efforts.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Access to contraceptives for youth and adolescent is critical to prevent unintended pregnancies, yet in Tanzania the percentage of adolescents using modern contraception remains low (18%) and there is an unmet need for contraception r (22.8%). The Tanzania demographic and health survey showed adolescent childbearing  to be on the rise from 23% in 2010 to 27% in 2015. Additionally, while Tanzania has progressive contraceptive prevalence rates; the same gains have not been observed for youths 24 years and below. Majority of Tanzanian women receive contraception through public health facilities and usually opt for less effective short term methods. For decades, organizations and governments have supported implementation of youth-friendly services (YFS) to increase uptake of services, however experience suggests that stand-alone youth clinics and separate-space YFS can be unsustainable. WHO recommends that, to ensure youth and adolescent responsive health system it necessary to have a model that responds to adolescent needs at each service delivery point at health facility level which recognizes the fact that adolescent/youth prioritize privacy, confidentiality and respectful care. Incorporating YFS elements in the existing contraceptive and health service delivery units has been recognized as a high impact practice with high potential for sustainability and scale up. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Chaguo la Maisha project in Tanzania mainstreamed YFS in existing public health facilities. Health care providers from various service delivery points, including contraception, labour and delivery and post abortion care were trained to offer contraceptive services and YFS, and they were then mentored to ensure skills acquisition through an innovative digital mentorship app. Some facilities were upgraded and equipment supplied to increase privacy and confidentiality of services. Demand generation targeting young people, client follow up, and collection of client feedback were conducted by community-based mobilizers using a digital app with an embedded contraception counseling algorithm, including Long acting reversible</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Implemented in collaboration with Ministry of Health in 96 health facilities in urban Tanzania, Pathfinder has implemented the Chaguo la Maisha project since 2015. The main objective of the project is to increase access and quality of contraception and post abortion care services to women of reproductive age with focus on youth, post-partum and post abortion women. The project covers 4 districts in Dar es salaam region which were reached in 3 phases. Phase one in 2015 in 2 districts (Temeke and Kigamboni) reaching 38 health facilities. The lessons gathered were scale up in 3rd district (ilala) in 2016 covering 31 more facilities and 27 facilities reached in 2017 in Kinondoni district.</p><p>To monitor progress on service delivery number, the project uses the government DHIS2 platforms that the facilities their performance monthly. The information from different departments supported by the project is then analyzed by age and methods. For community based data, CommCare platform is used to track real time client recruitment, counselling, completion of referral and follow up. Using Pathfinder quality standards checklists and competency based checklist built in a mobile mentorship application, providers competencies were monitored overtime.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>From Jan 2015 – Jun 2018, CLM served 223,795 clients with contraceptive services (including pills, injectables, implants, IUDs, and permanent methods), of which 35% (n=78,578) were young people (ages 10-24 years). As the project scaled up, the pace at which young people accessed contraceptive services increased at a consistent and comparable pace to that of adults.</p><p></p><p>Over time, young people (10-24 years) increased their access to long-acting and reversible contraception (LARCs), from 40.9% (Jan – Jun 2015) to 79.1% (Jan – Jun 2018), signaling improved access to the full method mix.</p><p>Community mobilizers referred 187,020 clients for contraceptive services (pills, injectables, implants, IUDs, and permanent methods), of which 48.8% were young people. Overall, young people completed referrals for services at a comparable rate to adults: 85.8% and 85.2% respectively.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Mainstreaming youth friendly services is important not only for sustainability but also in ensuring continuum of care of the clients. Efforts however must be made to build capacity of both providers and facilities (including availability of necessary equipment and service delivery space). Additionally, capacity building must be coupled with addressing context specific provider bias and value clarification.</p><p>Youth focus should be explicit in the program that also focuses on other age groups or population segments. As much as the review of national training curriculum integrated relevance of services to youth, the program kept additional training day for youth friendly services. In addition, age, segregated data was used during performance monitoring forums with all levels (providers, facility management and Ministry of health).</p><p>When youths are given options, they are likely to choose a longer acting, more effective contraceptive method. The options however should be presented in unbiased manner, with a competent provider who will ensure good clients’ experience and availability of required commodities. Providers’ mentorship is key in achieving the desired competencies.</p><p>To ensure quality and consistency of services offered, a well-designed user friendly mobile application is a useful tool for both community based mobilizers and facility based providers (mentors for this case).</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>While nearly half of the population of Madagascar is aged under 15, and age of sexual consent is just 14 years old, a lack of data makes rendering the impact of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues extremely challenging. Implemented since 2016, Project Safidy has identified a lack of awareness amongst young people of their sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR), while its comprehensive review of education policies highlighted a broader absence of SRHR in the national education framework. As such, the project advocates to embed a rights-based, context-specific SRHR curriculum within the national education framework in order to improve young people's’ SRH knowledge, attitudes and practices.</p><p>Still, significant socio-cultural barriers to implementing an SRHR curriculum are apparent at community and institutional levels. Sensitisation of these wider influences is essential in applying a curriculum that encompasses topics such as gender empowerment, bodily autonomy and advocacy. Indeed, cultural norms and gender stereotypes need to be challenged within the educational structures of Madagascar in order to shift perspectives on bodily autonomy. Ultimately shifting perspectives will improve broader socioeconomic development outcomes, including decreasing education dropout rates due to early marriage or unintended pregnancy, thus providing young women with opportunities for higher economic attainment. </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>There are significant gaps in the knowledge and understanding of the SRHR of young people in Madagascar. This is as a result of a gap in robust understanding and provision for SRHR at the institutional and community levels, despite the Malagasy government ratifying numerous human rights treaties. What are the main barriers in advocating for a national rights-based SRH curriculum in Madagascar, and how can we hold stakeholders accountable for its implementation?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The principle approach taken for this paper is a thematic narrative of the main barriers faced when advocating for a national SRHR curriculum in Madagascar. A comprehensive analysis was conducted of the community and national barriers that have thus far prevented an integrated national SRHR curriculum.</p><p>Narrative evidence outlining discussion of implementation barriers was collected from a series of four workshops attended by the Ministry of National Education (MEN) and British NGO SEED Madagascar between September and December 2017. These workshops sought to establish the content and implementation strategy of a national SRHR curriculum. This narrative was reviewed and categorised into areas of legal, procedural, logistical and cultural barriers faced when advocating for this curriculum.</p><p>Broader narrative evidence was collected from over 30 stakeholders during a National SRHR Network Conference held in Antananarivo in January 2018. Analysis of the obstacles outlined by actors currently implementing SRHR programmes were thematically organised into identified topics.</p><p>Semi-structured interviews and/or focus groups with three MEN representatives, 13 teachers and 26 students will be conducted from July 2018-October 2018 to triangulate existing results and gain a three-tiered, qualitative insight into the barriers faced when advocating for the implementation of an SRHR curriculum in Madagascar.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Following workshops with Ministry representatives and discussion at the National SRHR Network Conference, four key themes were identified which potentially obstruct a strong SRHR framework at institutional and local levels. These include:</p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>Lack of human and financial resources and high staff turnover caused the MEN to struggle to efficiently coordinate the development of policies to support the national rollout of an SRHR curriculum. The uncoordinated cross-governmental approach resulted in policy duplication (both the MEN and Ministry of Public Health independently developed an SRHR curriculum), while gaps in service provision went unaddressed. </p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Regionally diverse beliefs, cultures and languages hampered open discussion of SRHR issues. At times, Ministry representatives encountered cultural discomfort when developing curriculum content and highlighted that teachers may also feel uncomfortable delivering certain topics to students. While Parliament has pledged to adhere to international human rights conventions, traditional beliefs reinforce detrimental cultural norms surrounding SRH, contributing to push-back of SRHR advocacy. </p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Lack of quality, contemporary data relating to the SRHR of youth in Madagascar, and unknown prevalence of STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancy, made it challenging to identify the most pressing needs. Coupled with low levels of educational attainment where many children fail to complete primary school and even fewer reach higher levels, a national SRHR curriculum would only reach those young people who attend formal education facilities, neglecting out-of-school youth. </p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Uncoordinated approach from the numerous NGOs and civil society groups working in Madagascar widens gaps in service provision and knowledge sharing. </p>\t</li></ul>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>With the SRHR curriculum developed by Project Safidy and the MEN set to be rolled out in 2019, there is still time to advocate for an inclusive rights-based curriculum which aligns more strongly to international best practice. Lessons learnt at the various stages of curriculum advocacy highlight core challenges (and solutions) which are widely transferable to other contexts where there are weak or non-existent SRHR frameworks. </p><p>This paper contributes to the emergence of SRHR education in Madagascar by identifying the current contextual barriers faced when advocating for this framework at institutional and local levels. It outlines the advocacy approach taken to ensure future state and institutional accountability. These lessons can be used to help inform SRHR actors in similar contexts of the key challenges in this process, including potential mitigation strategies, and provides actors in Madagascar with current information to direct and shape their interventions. Additionally, an SRHR Online Network developed by Project Safidy will facilitate sharing of resources, lessons learned and challenges to encourage more targeted and coordinated responses to the main SRHR issues in Madagascar.  </p><p>Over the coming months, Project Safidy will delve further into these challenges and conduct interviews with ministry officials, teachers and students in a bid to explore in-depth some of these barriers. This will be coupled with quantitative analysis of results from a National Pilot which will further examine the challenges of implementing an SRHR curriculum to refine future SRHR advocacy and policy.</p>",

      "title": "Exploring Scale, Strategy and Locating CSE within ‘Udaan’, a Best Practice Adolescent Health Education Initiative in India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>India is home to 254 million young people (10-19 years) with the youth being the largest and fastest growing demographic. There is a lack of mandated and uniform Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) in schools across India putting adolescents at a high risk of sexual diseases, mental health vulnerabilities, low contraceptive usage, unwanted pregnancies, HIV, early marriage and violence. Udaan is an at-scale (vertical and horizontal) school-based adolescent health education programme in the state covering all the secondary schools of Jharkhand in India since 2006. Subsequently, it was also expanded to primary schools. Udaan sustains in Jharkhand, while such programmes in other states have either halted due to opposition or gradually fizzled out. A primary reason for Udaan’s success has been its integration into the state government system, while its host organisation Centre for Catalyzing Change (C3 India, formerly CEDPA India) is now only required for technical assistance.This paper elaborates on Udaan’s journey, through its conceptualization, implementation, strategic advocacy for scaling, challenges faced, monitoring and evaluation processes, course-corrections, and its integration into the state government. This paper explores this best practice model’s strategic incorporation of life skills, CSE and family planning (FP), such that it addresses these without spelling it out.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Udaan is reaching out to over 10,00,000 adolescents (girls and boys) in nearly 3000 government middle, secondary and high schools in the state of Jharkhand, India to promote healthy knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours for in-school adolescents. C3 provides technical assistance (TA) to the Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL), Government of Jharkhand since 2006 to strengthen the state education system to strengthen the programme. The content combines life skills education and reproductive sexual health information to adolescents in order to improve their educational, health and family planning outcomes.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The content for Udaan was finalized after several reviews by the government department. The topics range from growing up, nutrition, sanitation, friendship and peer pressure, gender, violence and harassment, substance abuse, parenthood, early marriage, and sexual and reproductive health, including contraception, and reproductive tract infections (RTIs)/sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV and AIDS and awareness of accessing adolescent friendly health clinics (AFHCs). It was first introduced in classes 9 and 11, but the success of the programme later led the government to introduce it in classes 6, 7 and 8 too, in an age-appropriate and graded manner. Udaan is implemented through a cascade trainer model through master trainers who train nodal teachers in each school who in turn transact it to the students. As part of the TA, C3 built capacities of the teachers and DSEL for implementation and monitoring and also succeeded it in embedding it within the states, teacher-training programme. In addition to transacting the curriculum, C3 also facilitated the inclusion of Udaan content across different subject textbooks for government middle schools in Jharkhand. Yearly evaluations were carried out to assess the impact of the program and required course corrections made.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In the current framework of the SDGs, Udaan fits in aptly with target 3.7 and 5.6 that have a direct impact on family planning. Udaan also addresses other targets and indicators under Goal 3, 5 and 10 that directly compliment the achievement of the family planning indicators while working directly with young people who have been identified as a critical crosscutting and at-risk population in the development agenda. Impact assessment of Udaan on students’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors conducted periodically (since 2007) showed favorable outcomes across various indicators, however the impact has varied with each evaluation leading to mid course corrections. Overall, there was an increase in the knowledge of puberty, ARSH, menstruation, HIV and AIDS, gender equity and self-efficacy. Specific to family planning, students were found to be 62.2 % aware of &gt;= 3 pubertal changes, 34.6% aware of possibility of a girl becoming pregnant after first intercourse, 69% aware of male condoms and 73.1% aware of female contraceptives, 45.5% aware of IUDs. Therefore, Udaan has been found to positively impacting adolescent health and well-being with specific success at scale in increasing knowledge of adolescents regarding SRH and contraception which enables them to make informed decisions regarding their bodies, family planning and accessing family planning services.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The eventful and enriching (and ongoing) journey of Udaan shed light on various best and strategic practices to make an at-scale in-school adolescent healthprogramme embedded within the state government successful. Udaan faced several challenges along its way, from frequent transfers of on-board government officials, delays in approvals, strategic positioning of content, discomfort of teachers, to parental and media backlash,to name a few. This paper shares how these barriers were dealt with to sustain the programme and explores in-depth what ‘strategic CSE’ is keeping in mind challenges of scale and working with a government that houses discomfort regarding certain topics. It is crucial for the civil-society adolescent health space to work with leveraging the positives of government intent and agenda while positioning its own goals and values in a way that reaches out to as many adolescents as possible with as much information and services as possible, and continuing one’s efforts to build on it while advocating for more innovation and change. WHO Geneva in the year 2016 picked UDAAN as a “first generation innovative adolescence program” with lessons for scaling, sustaining, and replicating and is distilling the lessons learned from this experience and documenting the same for wider global application.Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India selected Udaan among the Good and Replicable Practices and Innovations in Public Healthcare System in India (2016). Continuing our search for innovation, we are expanding our model to the out-of-school set-up, to compliment Udaan and connect the adolescents to adolescent friendly service</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Per the most recent National Maternal and Infant Health Survey of 2014-2015, 20.7% of young women in Guatemala become pregnant for the first time before age 19, contributing to one of the highest adolescent fertility rates regionally: 92 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19. In Guatemala, only 7.7% of adolescents between ages 15 and 19 currently use a modern contraceptive method. 20.9% of young women between 15 and 24 expressed an unmet need for family planning, the highest of any age group, implying that various barriers exist to access. Among young adults, 43.4% have never received a class on sexual health (MSPAS et al. 2010). Young Guatemalans need accessible opportunities to learn about sexual and reproductive health so that they can determine their rights, prevent sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies, and achieve more equitable futures. In 2015, with the goal of increasing knowledge around and use of contraceptive methods in adolescents, WINGS Guatemala began to implement  the CHOICE model of contraceptive care and LARC First counselling on a community level, and in 2017 WINGS strengthened its Peer Education Program by adopting the “It’s All One” curriculum complemented by sections of the “<em>Abriendo Oportunidades</em>” curriculum.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Youth Peer Education Program participants aged 13-19 are trained in reproductive health topics and counselling and facilitation skills to help themselves and their peers make responsible reproductive health decisions. The focus of the program is adolescent pregnancy prevention through the replication of acquired learning via health fairs, informal and formal talks. Youth Program participants are expected to know the main content of the curricula and have the communication skills to effectively educate peers and make referrals to contraceptive services, which are provided in youth-friendly spaces based on CHOICE model of contraceptive care and LARC First practice totally free of charge.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Initial steps were taken in 2015 to train all staff, but with emphasis on field educators, youth program coordinators, and nurses to become knowledgeable on all birth control methods, especially LARC, so as to answer basic questions and debunk myths, especially on IUDs, and have capacity to present to adolescent patients based on evidence. Nurses received proper LARC training including insertion, removal, and patient management.  This created an evidence-based agreement that LARC are first line contraceptive options and the most effective reversible methods, proven to reduce unintended teen pregnancy and abortion.  To reduce barriers, friendly spaces were created and cost was eliminated.</p><p>At the end of 2016, an internal program review was conducted and 11 recommendations were made for program improvement. Each of these recommendations began to be implemented in early 2017, including the full adoption of the evidence-based curriculum “It’s All One” to address gender and power in intimate relationships, with a focus on pregnancy prevention for adolescents, and self-empowerment, complemented by sections of the “<em>Abriendo Oportunidades</em>” curriculum aimed building and improving leadership skills within each participant.</p>",

      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Reviewing data from previous years demonstrates that implementing WINGS’ Youth Peer Education Program using the CHOICE model of contraceptive care and LARC First practice, together with “It’s All One” curriculum complemented by sections of the “<em>Abriendo Oportunidades</em>” curriculum has resulted in an increase in reproductive health knowledge and contraceptive method uptake by adolescents.  Guatemala has what some consider a progressive Family Planning law, which permits adolescents looking to use a LARC to do so without parental consent, but there still exist critical economic and social barriers and hardships that limit or prevent access. That is why WINGS created youth-friendly spaces to provide adolescent-specific counseling sessions and removed all costs making all contraceptive services free of charge to our adolescent population.  While this strategy has worked for WINGS, we believe that it may not be fully replicable in other contexts, therefore country and non-governmental programs should consider tailoring implementations (using proven methodologies and practices) to best serve the adolescent population in their settings.         </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are one of the fundamental aspects of life. In Egypt they receive little attention in public health discussions because of cultural sensitivities and traditional religious and community values which restrict SRHR education for young people. Many Egyptians families assume that their children do not need to know about SRHR issues until they get married. This idea result in long-standing taboos and wide spread of misconceptions surrounding sexuality.</p><p>The idea of Love Matters Arabic project is to provide SRHR information and open discussions using digital media which has an evidence of being cost effective way to reach young people as the majority of young people in Egypt have access to internet and social media and many of them use it as source of information to sexuality topics which isn’t offered by traditional media, schools and families.</p><p>Since 2017 the project expanded to include activities that mainly aim to strengthen change makers and advocates to mobile communities of young people on SRHR. One of those activities is Love Matters Arabic Sexual education toolkit which is an innovative youth-oriented sexual education tool.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p><strong>The Toolkit</strong></p><p>Sexual education kit is an interactive visual kit focuses on sexual anatomy, puberty, reproduction and family planning with the appropriate terms in Arabic. The kit is suitable for different age groups. All illustrations are line art with uniform strokes. Text is minimal to prioritize visuals. Each part of the kit is interactive to help people remember the information better. The kit includes illustrations to family planning methods. The first kit was an idea of the graphic designer “Ahd Sherif” and Love Matters adopted it to it’s’ brand and added to it Love Matters Arabic content.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Concept</strong></p><p>The initial inspiration for the project is a first aid kit: various items in one box that could help save a life. The sexual education kit too has much of the information one needs to save their sexual life. The Sexual Education Kit supports the right for youth to learn, be taught, and be shown everything they need to learn about their bodies and use them in safe and appropriate ways. It prioritizes safe and open learning.</p><p></p><p><strong>Parts inside the kit </strong></p><p>The kit is composed of five main parts each part has its own folded space inside the kit.</p>\t<li>Puberty, which is in the middle of all the parts, to emphasize on the idea that puberty is the center of all the other parts.</li>\t<li>On the right female body and female reproductive system.</li>\t<li>On the left male body and male reproductive system.</li>\t<li> The top part is about sexual intercourse and sexual response cycle with important information about the hymen.</li>\t<li>The bottom part has the fertilization and pregnancy to educate people how pregnancy happens, in addition to family planning methods cards in the case if they want to enjoy sex without risk of unwanted pregnancy.</li>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Visuals</strong></p><p> Illustrations are given priority; they speak more than the readable text. Text is straight to the point. The information is picked out carefully to give the reader an idea and what every part is about and the visuals take it from there. Some of the illustrations are interactive and some are still to portray what needs to be taught. For example, the reproductive organs are still but you can fold to see the order from external to internal. The kit visuals are very detailed to an extent that people can understand what is intended to be said about the part without having to read the text.</p><p></p><p><strong>Promoting Equality </strong></p><p>The parts inside the kit are separated but they are in one kit next to each other. All the illustrations are given the same treatment and no gender is prioritized over the other. The information is written in a way that suits both genders.</p><p><strong>Interactivity</strong></p><p>The kit has the ability to fold. It has pockets that have cards and other visuals inside of it, a circle to show the stages of a baby inside the mother’s womb. It control where attention is headed according the sequence of the events in the right order. It enables the person using the kit the ultimate feeling of exploring their own bodies through paper and pieces of information.</p><p><strong>Promoting family planning</strong></p><p>The kit include illustrations to all family planning methods as well as information about how each method used and its effectiveness.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The sexual education kit answers many of the question girls, boys, men, and women might have about their bodies and sexual activity. It also works to assist them to know their bodies more without shame. The kit supports the right for youth to learn, be taught, and be shown everything they need to learn about their bodies and use them in safe and appropriate ways. It prioritizes safe and open learning rather than youth learning the wrong information.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>While adolescent fertility is declining throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), unintended pregnancy remains common and young women still face considerable risk of HIV infection.  Declining fertility can be attributed to social change (including increased access to schooling and rising socioeconomic status), delayed sexual initiation, and use of condoms and other contraceptives.  Social change may precipitate behavior change among young people, and behavior change may also catalyze social change.  Since 1994, the Rakai Health Sciences Program in southwestern Uganda has conducted programs to prevent and treat HIV infection and to reduce unintended pregnancy.  Simultaneously, considerable social change has occurred in Rakai District, including improved socioeconomic conditions and access to primary and secondary schooling. In prior research, rising school enrollment over time in Rakai was associated with a significant decline in HIV risk behaviors and a sharp decline in HIV acquisition among young women; we sought to understand whether these changing social conditions also influenced adolescent fertility.  An enhanced understanding of distal and proximate determinants of adolescent pregnancy can guide the development of new and enhanced policies and programs that influence adolescent fertility.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We examine the association of rising school enrollment among young women and changes in other social factors on behavioral risk of pregnancy, including change in sexual experience and the types of contraceptives used by young women.  We hypothesize that: 1-rising school enrollment over time would contribute to declining adolescent pregnancy risk and fertility; 2-compared to those who had left school, young women in school would have a decreased prevalence of sexual experience and increased prevalence of contraceptive use; and 3-rising school enrollment and declining pregnancy risk over time would be related to declines in child marriage.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data from 16 survey rounds (1994-2016) of the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) were used to assess social determinants, demographic factors, sexual activity, condom and contraceptive use, and pregnancy experience among adolescent women 15-19 years.  The RCCS is a population-based, open cohort of households; 28 communities have been followed continuously since 1994.  Social determinants include school enrollment, asset-based socioeconomic status, orphanhood status, residence in rural v. trading villages, religious affiliation, and marital status.  Sexual behaviors included ever having had sex, sexual activity in past year, and method(s) of contraception currently being used.  Pregnancy risk was assessed based upon sexual activity, nonuse of contraception or use of a specific method of contraception, and method-specific contraceptive failure rates.[1]  The pregnancy risk index (PRI) method was developed and validated in the United States.[2]  A woman’s PRI score estimates her risk of pregnancy over the next year, based on her current behaviors.  Statistical evidence for change in PRI scores over time was assessed using generalized linear mixed models that account for within-subject correlation.[3]  Given changing age structure within the 15-19 age group, analyses controlled for single year of age.  The sample included 15,265 women-rounds of observation (702 to 1359 women per round).</p><p>[1]Polis-2016</p><p>[2]Santelli-2007</p><p>[3]McCulloch-1997</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>School enrollment among adolescent women in Rakai rose from 25% in 1994 to ~60% in 2016; this increase began before the promulgation of a national policy of universal primary education in Uganda in 1997.  Socioeconomic status also rose considerably over time.  Orphanhood (death of one or both parents) declined from 51% in 2004 to 25% in 2016, the period in which anti-retroviral treatments became widely available.  From 1994 to 2016, ever having married among 15-19 year olds declined from &gt;80% to </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Adolescent pregnancy declined in Rakai from 1994 to 2016 as adolescent enrollment in school and household socioeconomic status increased, and orphanhood declined. Change in these social factors was accompanied by declines in sexual activity and improved contraceptive use.  These data strongly support public programs to improve access to education, to encourage school enrollment, and to increase access to condoms and contraception for girls.  Our findings also support efforts to use economic empowerment and conditional cash transfers to prevent HIV infection by keeping girls in school.[4],[5]  Our data suggest that “combination prevention of unintended pregnancy” (employing multiple effective strategies) may be working to prevent adolescent pregnancy in Rakai, just as combination prevention of HIV has been effective in Rakai and elsewhere.[6]   Moreover, expansion of girls’ education appears to have been highly effective in preventing child marriage.  Understanding adolescent social transitions such as leaving school, initiating sexual intercourse, getting married, and initiating childbearing is essential to effectively promote sexual health among young people. </p><p>[4] Kim J, Pronyk P, Barnett T, Watts C.

      "title": "Future scenarios of adolescent contraceptive use, cost and impact in developing regions",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>About half of all pregnancies among adolescent females aged 15 to 19 in developing regions are estimated to be unintended, and more than half of these unintended pregnancies result in induced, and often unsafe, abortion (Darroch et al. 2016). Direct provision of contraceptive methods to adolescents is an effective intervention for preventing unintended pregnancy, and ensuring that a wide range of methods is available and quality counseling provided is a critical component of these services. Anticipating future trends in adolescent contraceptive use, the mix of methods used and the cost is important for domestic budget and donor investment planning, understanding total market demand for contraceptives, and to inform policymakers and public and private sector program managers about potential changes in adolescent contraceptive use patterns.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We examine the relative role that an acceleration in modern contraceptive method use and a shift towards the use of long-acting, reversible contraceptive methods would have in terms of future needs, cost and impact on unintended pregnancy. We compare a scenario based on the median of model-based, probabilistic projections to an accelerated growth scenario assuming a 50% proportionate reduction in traditional method use and unmet need for family planning to modern method use. We also compare the current mix of modern methods used by adolescents to a 20% proportionate switch from short-acting to long-acting, reversible methods. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The future scenarios are from 2020 to 2030 and focus on modern contraceptive use among adolescent women 15 to 19 years old in developing regions. We compute the associated costs and impact on adolescent unintended pregnancy for each scenario. Results are for geographic regions and sub-regions. All scenarios use the same projections of the number of adolescents (United Nations World Population Prospects 2017 revision, medium variant) and the proportion of adolescent women who are married or in a cohabiting union (United Nations 2018). We also use probabilistic projections to 2030 of family planning indicators among 15-19 year old married and unmarried adolescent women (United Nations forthcoming; Wheldon et al. 2017a).</p><p></p><p>Estimates of the distribution of contraceptive methods used by adolescents, the annualized per-user costs of contraceptive services (in 2017 U.S. dollars) and the impact of adolescents’ contraceptive use on preventing unintended pregnancy are based on a 2017 <em>Adding It Up</em> study for reproductive-age women in developing regions (Darroch et al. 2017; Darroch 2018). Costs under each scenario vary across regions in part due to the different projected numbers of adolescent modern method users, mix of modern methods used, and the varying costs of contraceptive services by region.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Growth in the number of adolescent modern method users is likely to continue from 2020 through 2030, particularly in sub-regions of Africa, and will add another 2.8 million adolescent modern method users in developing regions under the median growth scenario compared to 2020 levels. In other words, there is a 50 percent chance that use will reach or exceed 19.8 million adolescent users in 2030. Approximately $310 million dollars would be needed annually to provide services to these contraceptive users in 2030 in developing regions (or $15.71 annually per user), ranging from $94 million in Africa to $110 million in Asia.</p><p></p><p>Under an accelerated growth scenario, the number of adolescents using modern methods would reach 27.1 million in 2030, with services requiring an additional $110 million dollars annually compared with 2030 costs under the median growth scenario.</p><p></p><p>The impact of future adolescent contraceptive use on unintended pregnancy is substantial. The median growth scenario would avert 7.1 million unintended pregnancies in 2030, and an accelerated growth scenario (which also assumes a constant method mix from current patterns) would avert an additional 2.5 million unintended pregnancies in 2030 compared with the median growth scenario.</p><p></p><p>The majority of adolescent modern contraceptive use consists of short-acting methods. However, a proportionate 20% reduction from these methods to long-acting, reversible methods (implants and IUDs) would result in cost-savings in commodities, supplies and labor costs, and have a heightened impact on preventing unintended pregnancies, even when the total number of contraceptive users remains the same.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The contribution of this study is its focus on informative scenarios of adolescent contraceptive needs covering all developing regions, building on probabilistic projections based on past trends in contraceptive use and unmet need for modern methods, and generating estimates of the associated costs and impact of these different scenarios. Other recent studies using scenarios of contraceptive use have either not been specific to adolescents, used illustrative yet extreme assumptions of meeting all contraceptive need immediately or have not examined the full range of service costs or a long time horizon (e.g., Darroch et al. 2016; Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition 2017, 2018; Prata et al. 2013).</p><p></p><p>This study quantified potential pathways to 2030 that adolescents’ contraceptive needs may take and the resources needed to provide services for different levels of modern method use, not only in terms of commodities and supplies but also personnel costs and indirect costs of programs and health systems. With adolescent sexual and reproductive health often subject to stigmatizing rather than evidence-informed assumptions, the information presented in this paper on what the future may hold, and further efforts that can build on probabilistic projections, help make a robust case for investing in meeting adolescents’ contraceptive needs.</p>",

      "title": "Live your dreams!  Using aspirational messaging and research insights to reach young people with family planning information and services in Liberia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Liberia, as in many West African countries, the need for improved access to family planning (FP) information and services is particularly acute amongst young people. In 2013, just 17.2% of all 15-19 year olds, and 32.9% of sexually active 15-19 year olds in Liberia were using a modern method of FP.  The unmet need for FP among this same age group was 46.6% in 2013. Overall, nearly a third (31%) of women in Liberia age 15-19 have begun childbearing.</p><p>To effectively reach young people and increase uptake of voluntary FP, it is essential to speak meaningfully to the interests, aspirations and concerns of young people; and to ensure that services are youth-friendly and accessible.  Public perceptions about formal health care and modern medical practices were significantly affected by the Ebola epidemic in Liberia, and the capacity of the health sector including voluntary FP services, was also eroded by the crisis.  In light of these broader challenges, it is especially important to ensure that voluntary FP services and messages in Liberia are grounded in a firm understanding about the needs and perceptions of young people. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>With support from USAID, the Planned Parenthood Association of Liberia (PPAL – a member association of the International Planned Parenthood Federation) implemented a 12 month project in Grand Bassa County, with the aim of increasing access and uptake of voluntary FP information and services.</p><p>PPAL partnered with the Government of Liberia, the John Hopkins University (JHU) and the Khana research group to develop, implement and evaluate a range of work designed to reach young people with services and aspirational messaging about FP.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To better understand young people’s perceptions of FP; youth aspirations; and community views about use of FP by young people, PPAL partnered with JHU to conduct formative research.  In-depth interviews were undertaken with stakeholder groups including mothers, community leaders, and community health volunteers (CHVs) (n=16). Four group discussions were conducted with adolescent girls and young adult men from rural and urban areas.  Females were sampled from a younger age range (ages 15-19) than males (ages 20-24) because Liberian women generally have a younger sexual debut than men.</p><p></p><p>To reach youth with information about FP and sexual health, JHU developed a 13 part radio series with information about adolescent health and FP around the aspirational theme ‘Live your dreams’.  PPAL coordinated listening groups in 10 schools, and CHVs organised community engagement meetings.  In April 2018 the Khana Group, conducted a cross-sectional survey of 15-24 year olds from project districts (n=462) to assess reach and recall of specific messages.</p><p>To meet demand for FP, PPAL partnered with local public health facilities to conduct outreach service delivery across 40 sites.   Health workers were trained to provide youth-friendly services using government training materials.  Routine services delivery data was collected to monitor reach.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Formative research found that young people’s aspirations (their hopes for the next 5-10 years) related primarily to completing education starting a career.  When promoted about what role sexual activities can play in achieving their goals, many participants noted that unplanned pregnancy could be a barrier, and identified that FP helped people complete their education and fulfil their goals.</p><p></p><p>Many youth participants noted that listening to the advice/instruction of parents and elders were important to achieving goals. When asked who they went to with questions about sex, most participants said they went to their parents. Other cited informal sources included older people, siblings and friends. However, when asked if they felt comfortable having youth ask them about sex and FP, most community stakeholders preferred that youth to go to FP providers or youth centers.</p><p></p><p>Fear of, and misconceptions about, side-effects from FP-use were prevalent.  In addition, most people (of all ages) had limited awareness of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods.</p><p></p><p>Of the 9,542 voluntary FP methods provided in the first nine months of the project, 56.9% were provided to young people. Of these, 61.4% were provided to new FP users.  Injectables (35%) and condoms (33%) were the most popular methods chosen by young people.</p><p></p><p>Within nine-months, PPAL provided information and counselling about FP to &gt;15,000 people, of whom 57.8% were </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>PPAL’s positive initial results in reaching young people was enabled by a communications strategy which was founded on information about young Liberian’s aspirations and perceptions of FP.</p><p>Young Liberians’ strongly value their educational outcomes and career prospects, and appreciate the potential of FP to help prevent unintended pregnancy, and enable them to achieve their goals.  These findings were used to inform development of youth-focused materials which emphasised the link between ‘living your dreams’, sexual health and voluntary use of FP.  Future voluntary FP communications efforts could valuably reinforce awareness of this link. </p><p>Similarly, findings that family and community members are a valued sources of information demonstrates the importance of ensuring that youth focused programmes seek to equip parents with the correct information to properly communicate with their children.  The project’s focus on community engagement, built awareness within the community to supplement direct messaging to young people. </p><p></p><p>Low uptake of LARC methods during service delivery, coupled with a lack of awareness about LARCs methods as identified in formative research suggest that more work is needed to disseminate information about these more efficacious methods.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the project disseminated messaging through multiple complimentary channels - including through mass media (via the radio), in schools, and at the point of voluntary FP service delivery (at clinical outreach sessions). This generated opportunities to repeatedly reinforce key messages relating to the value of voluntary FP amongst young people.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The world currently has the highest number of adolescents in all of history. Africa is home to quite a number of them, most of these adolescents in Africa live in rural areas where they are more disadvantaged and their reproductive decisions could have telling impacts on their lives, family planning (Contraceptive) has been identified as important to avoiding such impacts. Factors associated with the use of modern contraceptives among adolescent especially female remains an area that has been extensively researched but it appears that the importance of mass media family planning messages of modern contraceptives use among female adolescents in rural Nigeria is under researched.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Does exposure to mass media influence modern contraceptive use among rural adolescents?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The data used in this study was extracted from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, with a representative sample of 38,948 women selected in two stages. All women in the reproductive age group 15-49 who were either permanent residents of the households or visitors who slept in the households the night before the survey were eligible for the interview, however, for the purpose of this study, we made a number of restrictions in the data including retaining data for adolescents and dropping other women, while we also dropped the data for adolescent women residing in the urban areas and eventually arrived at a weighed sample size of 4473 women. Data was analyzed using Stata Version 13.0 at the three stages of analysis. Firstly, a descriptive summary of all the independent variables were presented using frequency distributions. Secondly, using the Pearson’s chi-square, we test the association between use of modern contraceptive and the independent variables used in the study. Independent variables that were found to be significant at (p≤0.05) were considered for further analysis in the multivariable analysis. Thirdly, binary logistic regression models were fitted to examine the role of exposure to mass media on contraceptive use among rural adolescents.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In many low- and middle-income countries, men continue to be the primary decision-makers about family size and use of contraception, with no or little involvement of women in the process. It is therefore important for interventions to promote involvement of both male and female partners in contraception decision-making by encouraging women to participate while also encouraging men to involve their partner in the discussion. To do so, there is a need to understand men’s and women’s attitudes, beliefs, and practices related to partner contraception discussion, and how these factors may influence contraceptive use.</p><p></p><p>This study examines these factors among young men and women aged 14-24 in Nigeria. Nigeria has a persistently high Total Fertility Rate of 5.5-5.7 births per woman, which has been attributed to high rates of teenage pregnancy (23%), early marriage, low modern contraceptive prevalence (10%), and high unmet need (National Population Commission [Nigeria] and ICF International 2014). Young women aged 15-24 years continue to have the lowest probability of using modern contraceptives compared to other age groups (Ankomah et al., 2011). Unmet needs remain significant among married and unmarried adolescents (15-19 years of age) as well as married youth aged 20-24 (NPC [Nigeria] and ICF International 2014).</p>",

And</li>\t<li>Which of these factors is associated with modern contraceptive use, and if so, whether these associations may vary between sexes.</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study employed data from the baseline survey of the evaluation of MTV Shuga Family Planning program, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed to increase modern contraceptive use among young people in Nigeria. The survey was conducted in February 2018 in three states (Lagos, Kaduna, and Kano). Multi-stage cluster sampling was utilized, resulting in a sample of 2,128 young women and 1,070 young men. Ethical approval was obtained from Tulane Internal Review Board and Nigeria Health Research Ethics Committee (NHREC).</p><p></p><p>All respondents were asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with several statements related to partners’ discussion of contraception, and whether they agreed that most adolescent girls talked to their partners about contraception. Those sexually active were asked if they ever talked to their partners about contraception. They were also asked if they were using any methods of contraception, and if so, what the method was. The behavioral outcome was dichotomized into whether a respondent was using a modern method of contraception. The final study sample size was 1,721 sexually active men and women aged 14-24. Logistic regressions were used to predict the outcomes. At the time of abstract submission, data were not weighted.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>There were wide gaps between attitudes and perceived norms, with actual discussion of FP with partners: the vast majority (79%) agreed that it was important for couples to discuss contraception, but only 32% disagreed that the decision should be left to the husband. Just over half of the sample believed that most adolescent girls talked to their partner about contraception. Only 27% reported having ever discussed contraception with their partner.</p><p></p><p>Young men were significantly less likely to have discussed contraception with their partners compared to young women, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Agreement that it was important for couples to discuss FP, belief that most adolescent girls talked to their partner about FP, and confidence that one could convince their partner to use contraceptives were all associated with increased likelihood of having discussed FP with partners.</p><p></p><p>Most of these factors had positive associations with current use of contraception. For example, disagreement that the husband should be the one that decided on contraception was associated with a 1.5 time increase in modern contraceptive use (p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our next analysis will be with weighted data; we will employ structural equation modeling with instrumental variables to predict partner contraception discussion and current use of modern contraceptives. Nevertheless, we expect that this study will have several contributions to the current literature. One, it underlines the wide gaps between attitudes, beliefs, and practices related to couple discussion of contraception in our sample – the gaps rarely examined in the literature. While acknowledging its importance, only one in two young Nigerians believed they could do it, and just one in four ever discussed contraception with their partner. Two, our results incorporate the perspective of young men and highlight the differences between men and women in their beliefs, attitudes, and practices in partner discussion about contraception. It is often assumed that young women face challenges in bringing up contraception in the conversation with their partner. Our results suggest that young men may also have difficulties in doing so. Further studies on partner contraception discussion should always include men’s perspectives. Additional qualitative and quantitative research is needed to understand challenges that young men may face. Finally, we found that beliefs, attitudes, and practices in partner discussion about contraception were important to modern contraceptive use, regardless of gender. This finding further underlines the importance of addressing both men and women in programs that aim to promote couple discussion of contraception.</p>",

      "title": "Covert use of family planning among sub-Saharan African women – reasons, challenges and consequences",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In light of the slow pace of fertility transitions in Sub-Saharan Africa, renewed international interest in family planning has been affirmed as a priority strategy to improve maternal health. Most programmatic efforts to improve contraceptive uptake have focused on women, as they bear the greatest health burden and are the primary users of modern methods. However, recognizing the reality that gender norms inform sexual and reproductive health (SRH) decisions, there is growing interest in including men in the SRH agenda. Couple-based programs seem a promising approach in patriarchal societies; yet, they may undermine women’s rights to have control over their own bodies, including their free choice to use contraception. The balance between pragmatic couple-based approaches and a rights-based perspective favoring women’s empowerment is brought to the fore with the issue of covert use of contraception. Covert use represents a strategy for women to challenge opposition to family planning, without suffering the social consequences. However, the social benefits of using contraception covertly need to be balanced with the costs of concealing use and the potential consequences of discovery.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The current study builds on a larger cross-cultural project focused on measuring women’s and girls’ sexual and reproductive health empowerment in Sub-Saharan Africa. This qualitative investigation elicited women’s decisions to use contraception covertly and the challenges in concealing use across cultures and residential settings. We specifically aim to address the following questions:</p><ul>\t<li>What are the couple dynamics informing women’s decisions to conceal their use of contraception?</li>\t<li>What challenges do women face when using contraception covertly?</li>\t<li>What are women’s fears related to disclosing covert use of contraception or being discovered?</li>\t<li>How are these experiences seen as similar or different across cultures and residential contexts?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Women’s and Girls’ Empowerment (WGE) qualitative study was conducted in 4 sites across three countries: Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda. Within each site, 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 30 in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted from July-August 2017 among women aged 15-49 and men aged 18 and older, selected from urban and rural communities, including eight female FGDs and two male FGDs. IDI participants comprised 12 couples, who were interviewed separately (12 females and 12 males) and 6 unmarried women, who were equally divided between urban and rural settings.</p><p>Semi-structured interviews were developed to explore women’s sexual and reproductive autonomy, self-efficacy and decision-making. All interviews were conducted by trained interviewers in local language, audio-recorded, transcribed and translated verbatim by country partners and uploaded in Atlas.ti and we used an inductive thematic approach to carry out the analysis. Investigators from each site read transcripts and identified emerging themes, which supported the generation of an initial codebook, shared across sites and revised using an iterative process. Investigators in each site applied the core set of cross-country codes and developed site specific sub-codes. We used matrices to examine patterns of covert use of family planning across sites and participant groups.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Covert use: from community norms to women’s autonomy</strong></p><p>Covert use of contraception was evoked across geographies, suggesting it was a common practice, enhanced by the diffusion of longer acting female methods. Couple dynamics were at the heart of women’s decisions to disclose their contraceptive decisions, encompassing a range of situations from lack of communication to conflict. Many respondents referred to covert use as the result of couple discordance regarding childbearing. It was also a strategy for women to test a new partner or distance themselves from a failing relationship. Couple dysfunction and gender power imbalance worked together to prevent women from asserting their preferences. However, the lack of women’s voice within the couple did not prevent them from exercising their contraceptive choices.</p><p><strong>Challenges in using contraception secretly</strong></p><p>Women faced challenges in using contraception covertly, including confidentiality and cost. Injectables and implants were often cited as a way to circumvent these barriers, yet some women worried about medical documentation or clinical signs that could reveal their practice. The most common concern was the fact that delayed pregnancy could raise suspicion.  </p><p><strong>Consequences of disclosure </strong></p><p>Respondents discussed the social consequences of disclosure in terms of couple disruptions, including mistrust, separation and violence. Mistrust lead to the weakening of relationship quality and potential couple dissolution. In some cases, respondents feared violence from partners. These reactions were exacerbated when women’s undisclosed behavior was thought to conceal infidelity. In rare cases however, male respondents suggested that disclosure could improve couple communication leading to agreement on family planning practices.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These results highlight the complexity of covert use of family planning for women across Sub-Saharan Africa. While women circumvent barriers to use contraception, lack of economic and social support, concerns related to side effects and medical documentation, and general fear of consequences of discovery constrains women’s autonomy.</p><p>In that respect, covert use poses a dilemma in the conceptualization of women’s empowerment, as women using contraception covertly are unable to voice their preferences but ultimately exercise their choice. From an individual perspective, women are able to achieve their preferences, while from a couple perspective, partners are unable to negotiate and find agreement on their reproductive choices.</p><p>Family planning programs that engage male partners, may improve couple communication, raising agreement on reproductive decisions, but should also protect and support women’s autonomy to prevent a pregnancy regardless of partner engagement.</p>",

      "title": "Inequalities in contraceptive use amongst men in Northern and Southern Nigeria: A decomposition analysis",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Contraceptive prevalence in northern Nigeria is one of the lowest in the world. Although contraceptive use has been shown to be a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and child health outcomes, less than 5% of women in North-East and North-West Nigeria were using modern contraceptives in 2013. Several studies have investigated the determinants of contraceptive use in northern Nigeria and what is evident is that the men have a critical role to play in demand for contraception and indeed health care services. Programs designed to improve demand for contraceptives in northern Nigeria should also pay adequate attention to the information needs of men.</p><p>Southern Nigeria has much higher contraceptive prevalence rates than the North. Socio-political, religious and other contextual factors have been described as reasons for the north-south gap in contraceptive use. Although the north-south inequities in contraceptive use have been extensively documented, there is a dearth of information on the relative contribution of the determinants of contraceptive use to the north-south disparities seen from the male perspective in Nigeria. If Nigeria aims to achieve its goal to increase contraceptive prevalence rate to 36% come 2020, the key factors that contribute to the north-south inequalities have to be adequately tackled.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We hypothesize that the north-south socioeconomic, sociodemographic, ideational, couple relationships and cultural differences contribute to the gap in contraceptive use and that these factors operate differently in northern and southern Nigeria. This study aims to determine the relative contribution of each group of factors. Furthermore, we aim to explore differences in the role that each group of factors play in Northern and Southern Nigeria.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey including 8557 men, married or cohabiting were used for this analysis. The outcome of interest was the use of a modern method of contraception at the time of the study by the men or through their partners. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition approach was used to estimate the relative contributions of the different factors to the inequalities in modern contraceptive use as described by men in northern versus southern Nigeria. The predictive value of the following variables was assessed:</p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>Socio-demographic characteristics: Age, number of children</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Socio-economic characteristics: Educational level, household wealth quintile, employment status and urban or rural residence</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Exposure to family planning information on the media: Radio, television, newspaper</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Ideational variables: Awareness of modern contraceptive methods, number of children desired and perceptions about female contraceptive use.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Conjugal relationship dynamics: Decision making in household, polygamy, attitude towards a woman asking the partner to use a condom.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Perception of gender-based violence</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Culture: Prevalence of Islam in cluster of residence</p>\t</li></ul>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>There was an 11.6% gap in contraceptive use between northern (5.8%) and southern (17.3%) Nigeria men. The socioeconomic, sociodemographic, ideational, couple dynamic and cultural variables included in the model explained 91% of the gap in contraceptive use- leaving only 9% of the gap unexplained. In other words, if we adjusted the endowment of men in Northern Nigeria to match those in the south, contraceptive use will increase by 10.6% in Northern Nigeria.  Interestingly, while Islamic religion as practiced in the south encourages the use of family planning, it significantly impedes the use of family planning in the North and contributes to 27% of the gap in contraceptive use between the northern and southern Nigeria. The results suggest socioeconomic status is the biggest contributor to the gap between contraceptive use in the north and the south (contributing 56% of the gap). The differences in ideational characteristics (13.6%) and couple dynamics in the north and the south (7.4%) accounted for the remaining portion of the explained gap. Notably, the recall of exposure to family planning media messaging by men in northern and southern Nigeria did not make a significant contribution to the north-south disparities in family planning use.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study adds to the body of knowledge on the determinants of family planning use in Nigeria by using the Blinder-Oaxaca methodology to estimate the relative contribution of each determinant to the north-south disparities in contraceptive use amongst men in Nigeria. The results suggest that Islam, as it operates in the North, is detrimental to family planning uptake, whereas, it is supportive in the south. Furthermore, this study reechoes the need for a deliberate focus on correcting socioeconomic inequities to bridge the north-south gap in contraceptive use. Also, the research highlights potentially modifiable factors including ideational and couple relationship dynamic factors that explain a significant portion of the north-south gap in contraceptive use as indicated by men in Nigeria. The socioeconomic, cultural and ideational nuances described in this study should guide family planning programming in northern Nigeria to enable Nigeria as a whole reach its slated target for contraceptive use.</p>",

      "title": "The Influence of Men’s Social Networks and Social Norms on Family Planning in Benin",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Between 1996-2017, unmet need for family planning (FP) in Benin increased from 28% to 36%. To address high unmet need and its related outcomes, it is important to consider demand-side barriers to FP use. Initiatives have largely focused on women, yet couple communication and family and peer influences on FP are critical socio-normative factors influencing FP choices. In Benin, one commonly-cited reason for women not using FP is perceived opposition from a partner, yet less than 4% of women have discussed FP with their partner. The lack of discussion around FP and the need for men’s approval indicates that new approaches are needed to engage Beninese women and men in FP discussions and decision-making. The Tékponon Jikuagou (TJ) scale-up intervention, which was conducted from 2015-2016 in Ouémé Department, encouraged reflection and dialogue about fertility desires and contraception by influential groups and opinion-leaders to catalyze diffusion of new ideas through women’s and men’s networks. In this analysis, we examined pre- and post-intervention surveys completed by men in the intervention communities with an interest specifically in assessing the content and structure of men’s social networks and social norms surrounding FP and the relation of these factors to couple’s intended FP use. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Little previous work has examined the content and structure of men’s social networks and social norms related to FP use. We aimed to document and understand the contribution of these social factors on intention to use FP by men and their wives. Specifically, we hypothesized that men who believed social norms around FP were more supportive of FP use and those with networks more supportive of FP would report greater intention to use FP with a spouse. Supportive social networks were operationalized in several ways including having a high proportion of their network that they communicate about FP with.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this analysis come from the baseline (n=505) and endline (n=522) men’s surveys from intervention communities in TJ’s scale-up in 2015-2016. The intervention took place over 15 months in 16 of 44 intervention villages in the Ouémé Department and sampling was stratified by region and village size. Prior to the intervention, a baseline survey was conducted and 18 months later endline surveys were conducted with different participants. Both surveys included a social network mapping census, which asked participants to name people they relied on for material, practical, and/or emotional support, and questions on FP norms, couple communication, and intended FP use. Participating men were over the age of 18 and in union with a woman ages 18-44. In our analysis, we described men’s egocentric social networks and social norms related to discussion and approval of FP use at both baseline and endline. Since use of contraception is not always directly controlled by the male partner, we chose to assess men’s reports of their intention to use FP with any of their wives as our outcome of interest. We then assessed the pairwise correlations and the multivariate relationship between men’s FP social networks and norms and intention to use FP. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The majority of respondents were over age 34, had at least a primary education, had one wife, had over three children, were of Fon ethnicity, and Christian. The social network mapping approach elicited a very small number of network contacts (mean of 2 contacts), and 14% of men listed no network contacts at all. Few of men’s networks included their wife (13% baseline; 23% endline). On average, over half of men’s network contacts were not male relatives (56% baseline; 67% endline) and/or lived inside of their village (65% baseline; 57% endline). Men had talked with a small percentage of network members about FP, though this did increase by over 100% between baseline and endline (15% baseline; 31% endline), and most believed it was acceptable to discuss FP in their community (78% baseline; 98% endline). The majority of men (67%) had not discussed FP methods with their partner(s) in the last 12 months. Forty-five percent of men at baseline and 52% at endline reported that they intended to use FP. In our interacted multivariate model, men’s network size and perceptions that people would incur sanctions in their community if they used FP were negatively associated with FP intentions at baseline but positively associated with FP intentions at endline. Communication about FP with network contacts, communication about FP with wives, and wives’ perceived FP approval were positively associated with FP intentions and did not significantly vary over time. This model accounted for 42.67% of the variation in intention to use FP.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This is the first in-depth study to assess the social networks and social norms related to FP use among men in Benin. Our multivariate model indicates that while social networks and social norms influence men’s FP intentions, other factors are at play as well. Additionally, in contrast to research on women’s networks, these men reported substantially fewer network contacts. That said, among the social factors we assessed, FP communication with network contacts had the most significant relationship with FP intentions, indicating that men discussing FP with even one network contact may be important to FP decision-making. Men’s communication with their wives about FP and their wives’ approval of FP also significantly relate to FP intentions. This reinforces global research showing that couple communication is associated with increased FP use. We also find that men believe that more of their network members approve of FP than men have actually communicated about FP with. Prior work has shown that men often make assumptions about their network members’ use and approval of FP, yet other work shows that these assumptions of high acceptability may be the first step in shifting FP norms. More than three-quarters of the men believed that it was acceptable to discuss FP in their communities and most believed that others approved of FP use, yet men are still not discussing it, which serves as a key barrier to FP use in Benin. These findings indicate both a need and opportunity for increased FP related dialogue in these communities. </p>",

      "title": "Employing the total market approach in family planning resource allocation: an agent-based simulation approach",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Contraception is unique among medical interventions in the breadth of health, developmental and economic benefit. However, unmet need for contraception is still high in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to several reasons, including inadequate governmental funding, inefficient resource allocation, and donor fatigue. In the 69 FP2020 countries, donor spending on FP decreased by 4 percent annually between 2011 and 2016. Urgent actions are needed to confront the challenge and expand the family planning (FP) services to more women under a limited budget. That requires an innovative approach to guide resource allocation and utilization. The Total Market Approach (TMA) has the potential to leverage comparative advantages of all market sectors to enhance equitable and sustainable family planning. TMA was originally proposed in early 2000s and has been adopted by government in many LMICs. It promotes the integration of all market sectors segmented by willingness to pay. However, implementation of TMA is challenging because FP market is a complex system consisting of a large number of market players, including health facilities of various types and women of different socioeconomic status and personal preference.  Thus far, there has been no study that quantitatively models the dynamics for TMA. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We develop an agent-based system sciences model to address the following questions: (1) what are the trade-offs in quality and quantity of FP service when allocating governmental resources, given women’s diversified demand for FP services; (2) how do different resource allocations influence the overall coverage of FP service, and for each group of women separately? (3) how to segment the market based on women’s willingness to pay, preference for quality, and sensitivity to price?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The agent-based model has three types of facilities: public facilities that receive governmental subsidies to cover the cost of both commodities and personnel and provide FP services for free; school-based facilities that function like public facilities, but only serve adolescents; private facilities that receive free commodities from government, pay for their own personnel, and charge a fee for service. There are also three groups of women: (1) women willing to pay for FP service, have a strong preference for quality, and less sensitive to price; (2) women not willing to pay, have a weak preference for quality, and very sensitive to price; (3) adolescents with attributes as women in group (2). A fixed government budget is allocated among the three types of facilities; and then facilities decide how much to spend on commodities vs personnel. The ratio of spending on personnel over commodities determines quality of service. Women have their decision function, reflecting their willingness to pay, preference for quality, sensitivity to price, need for family planning, and prior experience with obtaining the service. All simulations were conducted in NetLogo 6.02 and results analysis was in Stata 15 SE.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The model experiment results demonstrate effects of resource allocation across facilities (school-based, private, and public) and resource utilization within facilities (commodities vs personnel) on the coverage of FP services. The experiments conducted include the combination of the following allocations and utilizations. Possible allocations among facilities: (1.1) spend most government resources on public facilities, and little on school-based and private facilities. This represents the situation of many countries where public facilities get most of the governmental budget. (1.2) increase allocation to school-based facilities to focus on satisfying the need of adolescents. (1.3) equally split governmental budget among three types of facilitates. Possible utilizations within facilities: (2.1) spend most resources in commodity procurement and little on personnel, resulting in high-volume yet low-quality FP services. (2.2) increase spending on personnel, leading to an increased quality at the cost of decreasing quantity of FP services. The model clearly demonstrates the trade-offs between quality and quantity. Spending more on public facilities and more on commodity procurement paradoxically leads to a lower CPR because the produced low-quality FP services are undesired and private facilities are squeezed out. The best allocation and utilization is achieved when quality in private facilities is sufficiently high to attract women willing to pay; quality in public facilities is high enough to attract women not willing to pay, but not enough for women willing to pay; quality in school-based facilities are high enough to overcome adolescents’ reservation utility.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our extensive literature review indicates that the study is the first quantitative investigation of the TMA, and among the first applications of ABM in the study of FP. Our system dynamic model explicitly considers the complex dynamics of the system and explores the non-linear, unintended consequences of resource allocations. Overinvesting on the public sector may squeeze out the private sector, and consequently leads to a reduced FP coverage. The best resource allocation is achieved when all market sectors serve their target population; all resources are used to produce FP service of quality that is just enough to attract the targeted population. In order to achieve the best allocation, policy maker need to customize the budget allocation based on the market structure and characteristics of women, including their willingness to pay, sensitivity concerning price and quality, and reservation utility. Our model can be used to assist policy makers in exploring the best resource allocation and utilization given market and women parameters, which can be obtained from market analysis and surveys.</p>",

      "title": "Expanding equitable and sustainable family planning programs through the private sector – Identifying key entry points for advocacy through political economy analysis",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Donor-funded social marketing efforts have expanded access to and affordability of family planning (FP) throughout developing countries. In pursuit of more users, these programs have inadvertently expanded their customer base among urban, wealthier populations as opposed to the rural poor, who are in greater need of free and/or subsidized FP products and services. These social marketing organizations sell their products at subsidized prices through commercial outlets, which can directly compete with commercial importers and distributors that do not get donor support. As FP donor funding is expected to plateau globally, governments and FP stakeholders are increasingly concerned about sustainability. In Uganda and Nepal, where the markets are dominated by free and highly subsidized FP products, such reduced funding could lead to a sudden dearth of affordable contraceptives. In this context, the commercial market actors’ viability is critical to ensure continued and equitable market growth. Governments, donors, FP stakeholders, and the commercial health sector should consider how to implement enabling policies and put in place effective market incentives. However, FP advocates have yet to successfully mobilize these governments to incorporate the commercial sector into existing coordination mechanisms or create policies that level the playing field across public and private sectors. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>To understand how to shape the market for FP in Uganda and Nepal, the USAID-funded Health Policy project posed four questions to be analyzed through a political economy analysis:</p><ul>\t<li>Why have the private sector engagement and enabling policies for commercial sector growth not been realized?</li>\t<li>What structures and which actors influence power and decision making in FP?</li>\t<li>How do the strengths and history of relationships among these groups and/or individuals influence their positions?</li>\t<li>What are the entry points to effect policy change and better align the incentives and motivations of multiple stakeholder groups?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The political economy analysis was an iterative process based on existing literature and insights gathered from individuals involved in the FP market. First, we conducted a desk review to understand past and current total market approach efforts, identify key national FP stakeholders, and highlight policies and regulations affecting multiple sectors operating in FP. From these findings, we developed research questions for both country contexts. Next, we developed interview guides for each key stakeholder group based on their relative position as a public, private, or non-governmental actor. We conducted semi-structured key informant interviews in September 2017 in Uganda and in January 2018 in Nepal with 28-30 stakeholders in each country from the public sector (health and non-health-oriented), social marketing organizations, non-governmental organizations and implementers, commercial sector importers and distributors, private associations, donors, and multilateral organizations. The interviews lasted between 30 minutes and one hour. We took handwritten notes supplemented by audio-recorded interviews if verbal consent was given. Finally, we coded the transcripts of each interview based on a set of key emergent themes, organizing the data into matrices to aggregate the strength of agreement or divergent perspectives among interviewees to draw out the findings.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In both Uganda and Nepal, commercial importers and distributors are rarely defined as part of the private sector, and therefore rarely engaged by the government. In Uganda, commercial sector players are interested in a dialogue forum with the government and other market players, but desire that the group be focused on specific objectives and be more action-oriented. Meanwhile, existing engagement mechanisms, such as the FP subcommittees and technical working groups led by the governments in both countries, frequently lack these characteristics.</p><p>The current FP business climate and regulations do not support total FP market growth in either country. The private sector, donor-funded programs, and donors all agree that the subsidized FP market creates difficult conditions for commercial growth in both countries. In addition, regulations such as strict and lengthy turnaround times for commercial product testing creates additional economic barriers to entry in Uganda.</p><p>Political support for private sector engagement varies between the two countries. In Uganda, a total market approach strategy is being developed by the government’s FP focal point in coordination with donor-funded key stakeholders. In Nepal, public-private distrust is marked, undermining policy formation that involves the private sector. Furthermore, the federalism process that decentralizes key decision making to the provincial level has caused the national government leaders to be reluctant to broaden the dialogue and experiment with total market approaches. In both countries, political leaders feel strongly that free healthcare should be available for all, which prevents significant advancement in leveraging the private sector for sustainable FP financing.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The political economy analysis identified a broad set of actions and interventions necessary to build capacity for private sector engagement in two countries marked by different population dynamics and stages of private sector market development. While action points and actors responsible for these interventions differed between the two countries, a few key themes emerged:</p>\t<li>Lack of data weakened the sense of urgency and business case for private sector engagement and commercial health sector growth among key decision-makers. These countries need stronger market intelligence that could be generated through market segmentation analysis and health financing assessments.</li>\t<li>Creating multi-sectoral, objective-oriented coordination mechanisms that draw in representatives from private, for-profit players are key to ensuring that enabling economic policies are put in place.</li>\t<li>As FP programs in these countries are still heavily reliant on donor funding, donors need to improve coordination and align around supporting commercial sector growth. More attention should be paid to establish clear incentives for implementers to define end-of-program objectives with consideration for long-term sustainability.</li>\t<li>With more robust data and strengthened multi-sectoral coalitions, countries should identify and support champions within the government who can ensure high-level political backing to drive forward policies that facilitate private sector growth. </li>",

      "title": "Helping private provider networks develop health financing options and contribute to national FP and UHC agendas: experiences from Cambodia, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>As governments in many low and middle-income countries develop mechanisms to pursue universal health coverage (UHC), including a targeted and sufficiently resourced package of family planning (FP) services is a key priority. FP purchasing and oversight mechanisms are not usually designed to incentivize quality and informed choice, and systems for commodity procurement, health worker training, and information are often missing. These challenges are particularly acute for private sector FP services, which often constitute a significant—if not predominant—component of overall FP services (Campbell et al, 2015). The public sector may lack understanding of how best to harness or support private providers, while the private sector can be too fragmented to participate in UHC-related purchasing mechanisms. “Aggregators”—such as Population Services International (PSI)-supported social franchises—hold potential to organize private FP providers into networks that deliver high quality, accessible services under domestic financing mechanisms rather than through donor subsidy.</p><p>Under the USAID-funded <em>Support for International FP Organizations 2 (SIFPO2)</em> project, Results for Development (R4D) and PSI have assessed the potential role(s) these aggregators can play in four countries to deliver better integrated, funded, and stewarded private FP services under wider government mechanisms for financing and governance.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Through work in Tanzania, Nigeria, Uganda, and Cambodia, R4D and PSI seek to answer a key question: what role can aggregators play to enable enhanced stewardship and financing of privately-provided FP services within emerging UHC initiatives, such as national insurance schemes or Global Financing Facility-funded programs? In four country settings, R4D and PSI have explored how the aggregator can better support/organize tiered and heterogeneous networks of existing or additional providers to: deliver services; engage these networks on behalf of planners, payers, and regulators; and help to both mitigate financial barriers to service utilization as well as enhance its own sustainability. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>R4D and PSI worked with the local PSI aggregator in each country to implement a set of four core analyses in an aggregator-focused, participatory approach to co-develop promising options. These analyses included: 1) an organization needs assessment, 2) a health markets analysis, 3) a health financing analysis, and 4) a health financing options analysis. These foundational analyses were conducted via desk research, in-country interviews with stakeholders across the national health market, and triangulation with aggregator staff. They helped to: define the existing financial sustainability of the aggregator and its provider network(s); examine the national health market and the aggregator's position within it; and explore sources and mechanisms of health financing, especially as those related to FP. The health financing options analysis itself was intensively co-produced with key managers from the PSI aggregator, and it identified potential roles for the aggregator to support private FP delivery. Finally, the participants as a group distilled this information and produced a prioritized list of the most actionable options to pursue within the country’s policy environment. The R4D-PSI support ended with meticulous documentation of all research, analyses and final products, as well as follow up technical assistance for implementation in some cases.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The analyses identified potential future roles for PSI aggregators in Cambodia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda under two broad categories: market facilitation and purchaser-provider intermediation. Market facilitation refers to neutral parties supporting processes for improved coordination, information, and partnership design to mitigate health market failures– for example, helping subnational governments develop the structures and mechanisms for public private partnerships. Purchaser-provider intermediation refers to roles played by organizations that reduce fragmentation in the health market by mediating the interactions and transactions of small-scale providers and addressing many supply-side failures – for example, aggregating providers into a quality assured network, whose services can be purchased by third-party payers.  </p><p>Overall, this work provided PSI aggregators with: an improved understanding of their country’s health financing system; tools for cultivating new funding sources; and greater staff capacity to devise health financing strategies and implementation plans. To this end, PSI network members in Tanzania and Nigeria have in 2016 and 2017 engaged directly in a market facilitation role with government subnational counterparts to negotiate and develop local contracts with the public sector. Similarly, in Cambodia, the work resulted in a plan to advocate with the national government for greater public-private engagement in health policy reforms. PSI’s network member in Uganda collaborated intensively with the Kampala Capital City Authority to develop a model of purchaser-provider intermediation to “decongest” the city’s overcrowded public maternity services by leveraging existing high quality private maternal and child health services. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This approach has shown how aggregators may access domestic financing mechanisms by evolving into roles beyond service delivery contracting. Through market facilitation, aggregators can help develop policies, regulations and an enabling environment for the emergence of a more efficient market. Through purchaser-provider intermediation, they can leverage their existing capacity—for instance, in network management, quality assurance, and monitoring and reporting—to directly address a market failing, such as lack of supply of high quality service providers or insufficient demand creation. Our work ultimately displays how these developing roles 1) enable strategic purchasing by governments, for FP and other services; 2) create entryways for private sector stakeholders to participate in key health system reforms; 3) support national objectives while continuing to improve access, quality, affordability and impact of private health care services; and 4) strengthen the broader mixed health system via improved stewardship and more inclusive and enhanced systems for procurement, training, and information flow. The models that have emerged through this approach can serve as a blueprint for other domestically-financed public-private collaborations, leading to greater and more sustainable access to critical reproductive health and voluntary FP services. This framework has also helped us to structure a practical guide, soon to be produced under SIFPO2, that can be used by network managers to implement this approach independently.</p>",

      "title": "Shifts in family planning funding under social health insurance schemes: Projected effects on private sector service provision",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Social Health Insurance (SHI) is increasingly common in LMICs, where it is often considered the most viable model for advancement toward Universal Health Coverage. Once established, SHI initiatives have proven effective at engaging large numbers of private providers in delivering covered services. As the types of services covered by SHI initiatives expand, we expect family planning (FP) subsidies, which have historically supported private providers through vertical programs, to be increasingly moved to payments under SHI programs.</p><p></p><p>The implications of this shift are complex. On the one hand, FP coverage under SHI schemes would likely include services not currently covered under vertical programs and improve service integration. However, most vertical programs have relatively stable commodity supply and payment systems; benefits especially important for private providers. SHI engagement with private providers is more complex than with public providers, and brings problems of payment delays, sectoral distrust, and politicization.  </p><p></p><p>We draw on three rounds of qualitative data collection regarding private sector experience with SHI services in Kenya and Ghana to explore the effects of SHI funding mechanisms on service availability and cost, and to extrapolate the benefits and risks of adding FP to this payment mechanism; a change being explored in both countries.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What are the likely effects on private sector service provision in cases where funding for family planning is shifted from vertical programs to SHI schemes?  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This paper draws from a dataset of 204 interviews conducted with private providers in Kenya and Ghana (Kenya N = 126; Ghana N = 78) and 106 clients (Kenya N = 56; Ghana N = 50). Providers were purposively sampled for SHI accreditation status and semi-structured interviews were conducted with providers across three rounds of data collection (2013, 2015, 2017). Client exit interviews were conducted in a subset of the sample clinics. Data were collected as part of the qualitative evaluation of the African Health Markets for Equity (AHME) program; an initiative that aims to increase access to quality private providers for low-income clients in Kenya and Ghana. This analysis also draws on early findings from a pilot program to fund contraceptives under the National Health Insurance Scheme in Ghana. Data was gathered by one of the AHME partners, Marie Stopes International Ghana (MSIG), through routine data collection from seven of MSIG’s network of franchised providers located in the pilot districts. Data was analyzed for the period May 2018 – September 2018.</p><p></p><p>Interview transcripts were coded in Atlas.ti using an open-coding approach that developed iteratively. Data from BlueStar pilot clinics was analyzed using an interrupted time series approach.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Private providers in both Kenya and Ghana joined SHI schemes due to client demand, the potential to increase and/or stabilize revenue streams, and a desire to serve a larger patient population. However, in Kenya, where accreditation was less common than in Ghana, many providers faced challenges becoming accredited under a system they felt was complex and difficult to navigate without outside help. Clients in both countries thought that enrolling in an SHI scheme would benefit them by making health services more affordable, but often faced both bureaucratic and cost barriers to enrollment and renewal.</p><p></p><p>Once accredited, providers in both countries believed that accepting SHI coverage made them more accessible to patients, and particularly those with low income. Indeed, data from the pilot districts in Ghana shows an initial uptick in demand for family planning methods covered by NHIS. However, in interviews, providers in both Kenya and Ghana tended to have an incomplete understanding of how SHI coverage works, particularly under a capitation system. This regularly resulted in providers limiting services and drugs to SHI-covered patients who they thought exceeded their coverage allotment. Due to their own narrow understanding of the system, SHI-covered patients rarely perceived that they were treated differently than patients paying out-of-pocket. However, some clients in Ghana, where the SHI system is more established than in Kenya, suggested that they have been receiving reduced services over the past few years; a finding that aligns with provider reports of significant delays in SHI scheme reimbursement during this time.  </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our findings indicate that funding FP programs under SHI schemes has potential to expand access to these services in both Kenya and Ghana by making both FP and wraparound services more affordable. In particular, SHI coverage increased access to private clinics, which patients said they preferred for the caring, respectful treatment they received there; a quality that is especially important for retaining patients in FP services.</p><p></p><p>However, frequently cited payment delays, particularly in Ghana, were particularly challenging for small private providers, who cannot depend on government for stable financing to support general operating costs, such as rent and staff salaries. It therefore appears likely that, as with services currently covered by the SHIs, providers will partially shift costs to patients should FP spending be included under SHI schemes. Concerns around providers charging patients informally for services are particularly relevant under a system of capitation, which Kenya has recently upheld after a series of debates regarding a possible shift to fee-for-service payments, and which Ghana is planning to expand country-wide after a pilot phase was deemed successful. We therefore recommend that governments conduct educational campaigns for both providers and patients before making any changes to FP financing mechanisms in order to ensure the reliability and accessibility of these services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Au Burkina Faso, 24% des femmes en union ont des besoins non satisfaits de planification familiale (EDS 2010). Cet indicateur connait une hausse de 11,6 point en 2015 soit 35,6% selon le rapport PMA2014-15/Burkina. Cela entraîne comme conséquences des nombreuses grossesses  et/ou trop rapprochées augmentant non seulement les risques de mortalité maternelle et infantile, entrainant ainsi la dégradation de l'état de santé de la mère et de l'enfant.</p><p>Différentes raisons expliquent la propension élevée des femmes à avoir des besoins non satisfaits en planification familiale dans les pays d’Afrique occidentale francophones et plus spécifiquement le Burkina Faso. Fort de ce constat, le gouvernement du Burkina Faso à travers ses plus hautes autorités, a pris des engagements visant à renforcer la planification familiale. Malgré ses actions, la propension des femmes ayants des BNS  reste élevée.</p><p>Les principales recherches se sont davantage intéressées aux facteurs individuels relevant de la demande de planification familiale sans souvent dissocier les effets des variables individuelles de ceux des variables contextuelles dans l’analyse des déterminants. Par conséquent, cette étude vise à examiner les effets individuels et contextuels des femmes associés au besoin non satisfait de PF.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Dans quelle mesure le contexte local et les caractéristiques individuelles influencent la propension à avoir des besoins non satisfaits de planification familiale chez les femmes en union au Burkina Faso?</p><p>Plus spécifiquement lesquels des effets individuel ou contextuel sont les plus déterminants ?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Les données qui ont été utilisées pour la présente étude sont celles de l’enquête démographique et de santé et à Indicateurs Multiples (EDSBF-MICS IV) du Burkina Faso organisée en 2010. La méthode d’échantillonnage qui a été adoptée est celle d’un sondage stratifié à deux degrés. Au premier degré, 574 ZD ont été tirées avec une probabilité proportionnelle à la taille, la taille étant le nombre de ménages dans la ZD. Au second degré, 26 ménages ont été sélectionnés dans chaque ZD avec un tirage systématique de probabilité égale. L’enquête a pu être menée à bien pour 17 087 femmes âgées de 15-49 ans, soit un taux de réponse de 98%.</p><p>Deux techniques d’analyses ont été utilisées : l’analyse des correspondances multiples (ACM) suivie de la classification ascendante hiérarchique (CAH) ont permis d’identifier le profil des femmes pouvant avoir des besoins non satisfaits (BNS). La régression logistique multiniveau a été utilisée pour estimer les effets nets des facteurs individuels et contextuels associés aux BNS. Trois niveaux ont été distingués dans l’approche multi-niveaux (Femmes, ménage et zone de dénombrement) permettant ainsi d’évaluer au mieux l’effet contextuel au-delà des effets exercés par les caractéristiques individuelles.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>L’analyse factorielle, nous informe que les femmes qui avaient une forte probabilité d’éprouver des besoins non satisfait en PF ont le profil suivant : musulmane, d’ethnie peulh, âgée de 35-40 ans, avoir plus de six enfants, n’a pas accès aux média sur la PF, leur conjoint veut plus d’enfants, désapprouve la PF et ne discute pas des questions de PF avec leur épouse.</p><p> L’analyse des effets aléatoires montre que la propension à avoir des BNS (pour espacer ou limiter les naissances) varie significativement entre les ménages d’une part et entre les zones de dénombrement d’autre part.</p><p>Aussi, des effets nets il ressort que les femmes âgées de 35-49 ans avaient 6,94 fois plus de risque en matière de BNSL comparativement à celles âgées de 20-34 ans. Pour les BNSE, ce risque était estimé à 69% mois pour les femmes âgées de 35-49 ans comparé à celles âgées de 15-19 ans. Les communautés où la proportion des femmes ayant accès aux médias est importante étaient associées à un faible risque d’avoir des BNS. Les résultats de l’étude estiment ce risque à 26% moins et à 30% moins respectivement dans les zones où cette proportion est moyenne et élevée. Le risque d’avoir BNSE était 29% plus faible parmi les femmes dont le conjoint approuve la PF par rapport à celles dont le conjoint désapprouve. Ainsi les femmes issues d’un ménage ayant un niveau de vie moyen ont un risque plus faible (OR =0,78) d’avoir des BNSL que celles issues des ménages pauvres.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>La problématique des besoins non satisfaits en matière de planification familiale constitue un des points d’intérêt de la communauté internationale, et particulièrement pour un pays comme le Burkina Faso où le taux de besoins non satisfaits est encore élevé (36%).</p><p>En faisant cette étude sur la Planification familiale, on a abouti au fait que les caractéristiques contextuelles souvent ignorées dans la recherche de déterminants des BNSPF jouent un rôle très important dans la réussite des programmes de la santé de reproduction et ceux relatifs à la planification familiale (SR/PF).</p><p>Au vue des principaux résultats et espérant avoir un meilleur impact des projets et programmes visant à permettre de réduire la proportion des femmes ayant des BNSPF, il faut :</p><ul>\t<li>Améliorer le niveau d’éducation de la femme en facilitant l’alphabétisation, la scolarisation et plus particulièrement celle des filles par le biais des programmes visant à réduire les inégalités selon le sexe en matière de scolarisation ;</li>\t<li>Mener des campagnes de sensibilisation de proximité en direction des femmes et leur conjoint sur les bienfaits et l’importance de la PF en tenant compte de leur caractéristiques socio démographiques.</li></ul><p>Enfin, d’autres recherches fondées sur des approches qualitatives devront se focaliser sur les facteurs des perceptions et de motivation des couples en matière d’offre et de demande de besoin non satisfaits et d’adhésion à la pratique de la planification familiale</p>",

      "title": "Drivers of Fertility Desires and Pregnancy Rates Over Time Among Couples of Varying HIV Status",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uganda continues to have one of the highest fertility rates in the world at about 5.7 births per woman and a HIV prevalence rate by end of 2016 predicted at about 6.5%, with the largest burden of HIV among women of reproductive age.  Findings from studies examining the impact of HIV infection on fertility desires are mixed: some find that pregnancy desires were significantly lower among HIV infected women, whereas other studies find that the fertility desires of HIV-infected women are not erased by HIV-positive status, especially in the context of combination antiretroviral therapy.  When examining pregnancy rates, studies have shown that a substantial proportion of people living with HIV (PLHIV) continue to have children after being diagnosed with HIV. However, most reproductive health services focus on contraception with limited understanding of PLHIV desiring more children.  Men play an important role in decision making in the home in many African contexts and studies have shown that the strongest predictor of participants’ desire for children was having a partner who wanted children.  Understanding fertility desires and rates among couples is important so as to better meet the needs of couples in settings with overlapping high rates of fertility and HIV.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Globally, the focus on reproductive health decisions among PLHIV has been focused on women’s reproductive desires and behaviours with only a few studies assessing these outcomes in couples longitudinally.  The goal of our study was to understand what factors drove the desire for more children and pregnancy incidence among couples in a rural African setting with overlapping high rates of HIV and fertility.  Our hypothesis was that HIV infection among couples will have a significant impact on fertility desires and rates and that couples desires for children will be a significant predictor of pregnancy incidence.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data from  6,647 couples aged 15-49 years from the Rakai Community Cohort Study in Uganda contributed to 7,656 couple observations between 2007 and 2015.  Individuals within households were linked retrospectively to form couples if they were married. Couples were categorized by their HIV status as HIV negative concordant (M-F), HIV positive concordant (M+F+), or HIV serodiscordant (M+F- or M-F+).   For each survey round, information was collected on sociodemographic (age, years of schooling, type of marriage, and religion), sexual risk (number of sexual partners, age of sexual partner, use of condoms), and reproductive behaviours (use of contraceptives, number of children).  The main outcomes of this study were fertility desire and pregnancy incidence among couples of varying HIV status.  The measure of association between fertility desire and couples’  characteristics was prevalence ratio (PR) obtained using a generalized linear model (glm) with a Poisson family and a log link. The incidence of pregnancy was determined as the number of incident pregnancies divided by the number of person-years of couple observation and in order to determine factors associated with incidence of pregnancy, a Poisson model generated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) as a measure of association.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Pregnancy incidence decreased over time for all couples, but was lowest among HIV serodiscordant couples.  The desire for more children and pregnancy incidence decreased significantly with age for all couples. Compared to high socioeconomic status (SES), couples who were low SES were less likely to desire children (M-F+: adj.PRR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.59-0.99; M+F-: adj.PRR=0.77, 95%CI: 0.63-0.94). However, women of medium or low SES had higher pregnancy rates compared with women in high SES unions (adj.IRR=1.20, 95%CI: 1.03-1.4, adj.IRR=1.36, 95%CI: 1.17-1.58, respectively). When a HIV+ female reported multiple sexual partners, the desire for more children was higher (M+/F+, adj.PRR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.03-2.0; M-F+: adj.PRR=1.90, 95%CI: 1.13-3.18; M+F-: adj.PRR=1.83, 95%CI: 1.2-2.8).  Males reporting multiple sexual partners had an increased fertility desire only if in HIV positive concordant union (adj.PRR=1.24, 95%CI: 1.05-1.4).  However, report of multiple sexual partners was not associated with pregnancy incidence. Co-resident children resulted in a decreased desire for children but was associated with an increase in pregnancy rates among all women. Having a female in HIV care was associated with a decrease in fertility desire (M+F+ adj.PRR=0.82 95%CI: 0.63-1.0, M-F+ adj.PRR=0.56, 95%CI=0.4-0.78). When both partners were in HIV care, there was a 40% decrease in fertility desires reported.  Pregnancy incidence was lower if at least one partner was in HIV care (adj.IRR=0.49, 95%CI: 0.26-0.93). Other significant factors associated with pregnancy incidence were desire for more children (all couples, adj.IRR=1.56, 95%CI: 1.33-1.83) and use of hormonal contraception or condoms (all couples, adj.IRR=0.85, 95%CI: 0.74-0.98, adj.IRR=0.8, 95%CI: 0.65-0.98, respectively). </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The desire for more children is influenced by many relationship dynamics and studies focusing on the perspective of women alone miss an important dimension impacting on reproductive desires and rates. Our study demonstrates that understanding fertility desires alone is not sufficient as the unmet need for family planning typically emerges when pregnancy incidence is assessed.  There are many influences that impact on the desire for children and our study found that in addition to socio-demographic factors, parity and sexual risk behaviours, the HIV status of couples was significantly associated with fertility desires and pregnancy incidence.  Our study highlighted that HIV infection does not diminish the desire of couples to want additional children and that there is significant unmet need for family planning among couples where at least one member is HIV positive.  Fertility desires and pregnancy rates often did not align in our study, especially when one member of a couple was HIV positive, demonstrating the need to address the reproductive desires of PLHIV and provide the resources for these couples to have safe and healthy pregnancies. Understanding the reproductive desires of PLHIV is critical as these couples who want to have children have complex needs which include maintaining the mother’s health, preventing MTCT and horizontal transmission in serodiscordant couples.  As HIV care and reproductive health services continue to strengthen in resource poor settings, special attention to the reproductive needs of PLHIV is critical.</p><p> </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>.The current contraceptive prevalence rate in Zimbabwe is 67% (ZDHS 2015) while the use of long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) remain extremely low (9.6%), according to ZDHS 2015 The contraceptive method mix is heavily tilted towards the short term methods with 41% of users opting for the pill. IUCD (Copper-T) is a safe, effective and long-acting reversible contraceptive method in which 14.3% women aged 15-49 globally in marriage or union are using. In Zimbabwe, IUCD uptake is currently less than 1% (ZDHS 2015).  Therefore, interventions to improve the method mix and uptake of IUCD require evidence highlighting key factors contributing to their low uptake and difficulties and limitations in the provision of IUCD in selected provinces in Zimbabwe.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Why is uptake of intra-uterine contraceptive device (IUCD) in Zimbabwe so low and what factors contribute to this condition?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A descriptive qualitative study design was conducted in 2016 to explore and understand perceptions of 169 women, 22 men, 16 community leaders (religious and traditional) and community cadres and 20 health care providers regarding the use of IUCDs (Copper-T). Eighteen focus group discussions (FGDs) with women, religious and traditional leaders and men were conducted. A total of 30 key informant interviews with health care providers and professionals and 45 in-depth interviews with women [IUCD users, past IUCD users, and users of modern contraceptives (15-49 years)] were conducted. Data was collected from purposively selected districts of Bulawayo, Harare, Matabeleland North, Mashonaland Central, Manicaland and Masvingo – in Zimbabwe. Data from the interviews and FGDs were transcribed verbatim, and translated into English while retaining the original meaning during the translation process. The NVivo software was used for coding. In additional, a manual coding process was undertaken following the six stages of Thematic Data Analysis.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The study revealed that rural clients (women) were reluctant to use IUCD because of the myths, misconceptions and fears associated with the method. The association of IUCD with barrenness, cancers, pregnancy complications, birth deformities, health complications, and heavy bleeding made. Negative experiences of past users was also identified as a barrier to IUCD uptake as they advised potential users. Males and community leaders perceived effect of IUCD on sexual relations – pricking the penis and coiling around it during intercourse, and limitations imposed on sex on demand by heaving bleeding and uncertain menstrual cycles. Some men also felt that IUCD insertion violates the sacredness and ‘dignity’ of women’s reproductive system – the existence of a foreign object in the system. The 10-year efficacy / potency period of IUCD was viewed as a reflection of a permanent contraceptive method by some women as well as men.</p><p>Health care providers (HCPs) interviewed in this study expressed their reservations about IUCD, and linked this to lack of training, skills and experience related to IUCD insertions and removals. These challenges were compounded by improper supporting infrastructure to deliver IUCD services (rural areas), especially in public sector health facilities with resource scarcity in terms of IUCD qualified and experienced health professionals, supplies and commodity shortages and maldistribution. Some providers had positive attitudes toward IUCD, and they were mainly professionals who were offering IUCD services routinely as part of their work.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The study unearthed negative community perceptions, dominant social norms, religious and soci0-cultural beliefs, limited awareness of IUCD among men, HCP’s attitudes and weak health service delivery platform as main barriers impeding IUCD uptake in Zimbabwe. There is need to strengthen IUCD service delivery in rural areas and hard-to-reach communities, and actively improve demand-generation efforts (through engaging and capacitating community based workers) while addressing user-side factors that serve as barriers to IUCD uptake in Zimbabwe. There is need to demystify the myths and misconceptions in the communities with regards to the IUCD. Multi-sectoral collaboration and community for development or social and behavioral change communication interventions are required to address conditions at multiple socio-ecological levels that drive low uptake of IUCD in Zimbabwe while improving the supply-side to drive demand for IUCD services. Such an approach would ensure that social norms, myths, rumors and misconceptions that militate against IUCD and more broadly LARCS are addressed. There is need to ensure that investments in reproductive health and family planning services are improved in order to improve MNCH outcomes in Zimbabwe. MNCH and SRH services not integrated effectively with IUCD / post-partum IUCD (PPIUCD) services and thus creating missed opportunities for providing IUCD services in the continuum of care should be addressed.</p>",

      "title": "Fertility Policy Change and the Choice of Contraceptive Methods: Experience from China, 2010-2016",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning in China dates back to 1950’s in response to the request of women for prevention of unintended pregnancies. Starting from 1960’s, the Government of China started to address the rapid growth of population and encouraged voluntary exercise family planning while promoting women’s participation in social activities. Since 1978, family planning was enshrined in the Constitution and in 1982, family planning became a basic state policy putting the will of the state ahead of that of individuals. IUD after having first child and sterilization after second child were set as norm for family planning. They account for about 90% of family planning methods used. After 1994 ICPD, with the international call for reproductive health and rights, client-centered family planning and informed choices were piloted in China and the mix of contraceptives began to diversify. In 2013, the fertility policy was adjusted that couples with one spouse being only child were allowed to have children. In 2015, further adjustment was made that all couples can have two children. With the new fertility policy in place, will the choice of family planning methods change? The research is to find out the change to inform policy making as it has implication for</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Since the 1990’s of the last century, China has started informed choice of contraceptive methods. Short-term and non-medical methods are increasing. Although the percentage of long-term methods does not change much, IUD is increasing and sterilization is decreasing. With the change in fertility policy, the change in mix of family planning methods also occurs. The study focuses on the changes in the mix of family planning methods at the national as well as provincial level brought by the addjustmetn of the fertilty policy.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The data the study analyzed is from the report by the provinces covering 2010-2016. The sources are China Family Planning and Population Year Book, China Health and Family Planning Year Book, and China Health and Family Planning Statistics Year Book. The Study analyzed the national and provincial data on “contraception prevalence rate”, “number of people using different contraceptive methods”, “the mix of contraceptive methods”, “family planning surgeries” by provinces. The study compared the data before and after 2013, when the first fertility policy was made, to show the impact of the policy change.</p><p>The analysis in this study employs descriptive, categorizing, and regression methods. The impact of the new fertility policy was discussed through comparing the change in contraceptive prevalence rate, contraceptive mix, and the rate of change in contraceptive methods. Social and economic development varies from province to province and so do the provincial family planning regulation and their enforcement. These are also factors influencing the contraceptive mix that are taken into consideration in the study.</p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The contraceptive prevalence rate of married women remains at a high level. It declined from 89% in 2011 to the present level of 83%. Sterilization declined from 30% in 2010 to 25% in 2016; IUD declines slowly and remains between 53-55%.  Use of condoms increases rapidly at 5-15% annually, but with a higher increase rate after 2013.  Before 2013, China had 3 fertility policies, one-child for developed areas, one and  half children for less developed areas ( if the first child is a girl, couples can have another child), and two and three children for least developed areas.</p><p>Condom</p><p>Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang, economically developed areas have large proportion of condom use. In less developed areas, condoms accounts for less than 5%.</p><p>IUD</p><p>The proportion of IUD is high in those areas with stricter family planning regulations.</p><p>Sterilization</p><p>Less developed areas have higher proportion of sterilization; developed areas have lower proportion of sterilization.</p><p>In almost all areas, sterilization is declining. IUD is declining at a slow pace.  Condoms increase in all areas with various rates.</p><p>Categorizing of provinces by the characteristics of the contraceptive mix</p><p>30 provinces fall into four categories: condom dominant, condom rapid increasing, IUD dominant, and sterilization leading. The situation has not changed much since 2014.</p><p>Contraceptive mix and abortion</p><p>A positive association exists between condom use and abortion (R=0.861**). People in China tend to think that long-term medically based family planning methods are not good to health. However, incorrect and inconsistent use of condoms causes contraception failure.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The analysis of data (2010-2016) shows that the fertility policy is a major factor influencing the choice of family planning methods. Differences in the mix of contraceptive between areas are due mainly to the differences in the provincial family planning regulations in the past. </p><p>The mix of contraceptives changed considerably following the changes in the fertility policy respectively in 2013 and 2015. The percentage of IUD use declines slightly, that of sterilization declines considerably and condom use increases rapidly especially since 2015 when two-child policy was announced. The current rapid increase in condom use is not real informed choice rather than an overreaction to the policy change. There is a need for communication with the clients on correct use of condom and on advantages of long-term methods so that clients will voluntarily use long-term methods for effective contraception.</p><p>The study only analyzes the data from a macro-perspective to show the changes in use of family planning methods before and after the fertility policy changes and does not analyze other factors influencing individual decision-making. Future research and study plan to use data on individuals to have in-depth understanding of the effect of policy change on choice of family planning methods.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In 2015, USAID-awarded the five-year Passages project to support development and testing of scalable social norm approaches to support healthy family planning (FP) and other reproductive behaviors with a focus on youth and adolescents in developing countries. One approach adapted and implemented by the Passages project is the Transforming Masculinities/Masculinité, Famille, et Foi (TM/MFF) intervention. The original TM/MFF approach was developed by Tearfund as an evidence-based intervention using religious leaders and faith communities to promote gender equity with the goal of reducing gender-based violence (GBV). Passages partner organizations added FP components to the curriculum, reasoning that reducing social acceptance of GBV and other gender inequalities would create normative environments more supportive of modern FP use.  One challenge TM/MFF and similar social norms interventions face is demonstrating the existence and contribution of social norms to their outcome of interest. Despite a growing conviction that altering social norms is essential for the reduction of harmful behaviors and adoption of healthy behaviors, little evidence exists to demonstrate the success of social norms interventions. The dearth of evidence largely stems from lack of conceptual clarity regarding what constitutes a norm and lack of consensus on standardizing and validating social norm measures.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The overall goal of this analysis was to describe the association of social norm latent constructs with the likelihood of future use of a modern contraceptive. Specifically, we were interested in answering the following questions:</p><p>1)       Which of the social norms items asked in the baseline TM/MFF survey captured similar latent social norm constructs?;</p><p>2)       What was the association of these social norm constructs with reports of intention to use FP among study participants prior to initiation of the TM/MFF intervention?; and</p><p>3)       Does the influence of social norms operates differently among male versus female participants?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The TM/MFF intervention study currently being conducted among 17 Protestant congregations in Kinshasa, DRC, seeks to shift social norms around modern FP use, intimate partner violence, and gender roles. TM/MFF uses a process of participatory scriptural reflections to identify, create, embrace and disseminate gender equitable beliefs. TM/MFF is a prospective, experimental, two group, pre-test/post-test design that is being piloted from 2016 – 2018 and is to be scaled up for a year if proven effective. At baseline, 900 congregants aged 18 and over completed a survey assessing FP use and related social norms. Given the absence of validated measures and lack of evidence to indicate which types of social norms and/or influential people may be most important to which behaviors, a variety of social norm indicators were included in the instrument. We conducted exploratory factor analyses in SPSS using maximum likelihood extractions with oblique (Promax) rotations with the entire sample to determine the latent constructs (i.e., variables that were not directly observed but inferred from measured variables) underlying the social norm items. We then fit a series of structural equation models to simultaneously assess the combination of latent and observed variables and their associations.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The majority of congregation members who completed this baseline study survey were of the Bakongo ethnicity, and had at least a secondary education. Eligibility criteria required that participants be in a stable relationship but over 60% did not have any children with their current partner. Over a third of respondents reported that either they or their partner were currently using modern FP and over half reported an intention to use in the future. Results of our factor analysis revealed four distinct social norms constructs: two related directly to FP use and two related to gender equity.  The social norms directly related to FP use comprised one descriptive norm (i.e., perceptions of actual behaviors), which captured whether the respondent believes others in their congregation use FP, and one injunctive norm (i.e., perceptions of approval of behaviors) of perceived approval of FP use. The social norms related to gender equity comprised one injunctive norm on approval of household chore sharing and another injunctive norm on approval of sharing in childcare. Our structural equation model fit the data well and revealed that all four social norms constructs investigated in this study were significantly related to intention to use FP. Notably, approval of chore sharing was negatively associated with FP intentions whereas the remaining norms were positively associated with FP intentions. Couple communication, number of children, gender, and FP access also affected FP intentions. Gender was not significantly associated with norms related to FP.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our findings confirm that TM/MFF is on target in focusing on social norms and the faith community to affect FP use. In this baseline analysis of a normative intervention, we found that even after controlling for both individual-level and couple-level behavior characteristics known to contribute to FP use, social norms among religious congregations in Kinshasha were influential to FP intentions.  We find that both direct (i.e., FP) and indirect (i.e., gender equity) norms affect FP intentions in the DRC. More specifically, the negative association between chore sharing and FP may mean that women in relationships where men assist in the household are willing to have more children. The association between gender equitable roles and FP and fertility intentions should be explored further. Importantly, gender’s lack of association with FP norms indicates that social norms interventions focused specifically on FP outcomes may be able to similarly target men and women. This analysis contributes important programmatic insight for normative interventions like TM and also supports the need for normative interventions to affect FP behavior. In addition, at endline, we will conduct confirmatory factor analysis to validate and refine these social norm measures thereby reducing the current dearth of validated social norms measures. We will also assess the changes in these measures from baseline to endline in order to add to the evidence-base sorely needed for demonstrating the effects of normative interventions on sexual and reproductive health outcomes.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>En 2015, la région de Sédhiou (au Sud du Sénégal), malgré de multiples interventions pour une offre contraceptive efficace, connait une persistance des besoins non satisfaction en PF (BNS). En effet, tous les contraceptifs sont disponibles au niveau des points de prestation de services (PPS). Le personnel de santé qui y officie a été formé sur les technologies contraceptives. Pourtant, même si des progrès sont notés avec un TPC qui passe de 6% à 17,9%, la région connait les taux de BNS les plus faibles du pays (la moyenne nationale d’alors était de 23% (2015)).  De 23,2% en 2010, les BNS passent à 24,8% en 2015. A côté de cela, la demande a presque doublé en passant de 25,8 % en 2010 à 42,7% en 2015. La zone de Sédhiou est intéressante à plus d’un titre. Les interventions dans la zone augmentent la demande, particulièrement chez les jeunes, par le biais des sensibilisations. Par ailleurs des interventions comme Informed Push Model (IPM) améliorent fortement la disponibilité. Pourtant tout cela ne suffit pas à améliorer le TPCM et surtout à réduire significativement les BNS.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Aux vues des constats prés-cités, notre question de recherche est de savoir pourquoi dans un contexte dit de repositionnement de la PF et de disponibilité des produits PF, des besoins non-satisfaits persistent ? Comme hypothèse, nous postulons alors que la persistance de l’insatisfaction des besoins en PF malgré un contexte de repositionnement découle d’une incompréhension de la demande de la part des politiques et se traduit par une offre inadéquate. Notre objectif sera alors de démontrer qu’il y a une incompréhension de la demande à travers une analyse symétrique des déterminants de l’insatisfaction des besoins dans un contexte de repositionnement.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Une démarche symétrique offre une discussion émique des BNS et permet de comprendre leurs traductions et leurs perceptions par les acteurs. L’articulation d’une approche compréhensive de la sociologie de la traduction et de la sociologie de l’usage a permis d’analyser les BNS dans leurs formes et leurs déterminants à travers une approche qualitative. Nos données sont recueillies en trois phases (aout, septembre, novembre) entre 2015 et 2016 dans le cadre d’une thèse en sociologie à partir de l’observation, de l’entretien semi-structuré et du focus group.  Ainsi nous avons assisté à un counseling (niveau poste) et à une réunion de coordination (niveau district). S’agissant des entretiens, 57 ont été menés au total dont 2 au niveau national, 5 au niveau régional, 5 au district et 45 dans la commune de Diaroumé. Pour ce qui est des focus groups, nous en avons mené 6 dont 2 (FAR et HAR) dans chaque localité. Notre échantillonnage raisonnée est constitué de trois catégories de cible : niveau macro (DSRSE, IH, Coordonnatrice SR de la région de Sédhiou), niveau maso (Coordonnatrice SR district de Bounkiling, dépositaire centre de santé, ICP, sage-femme et dépositaire poste de Diaroumé) et le niveau micro (relais, FAR, HAR de 3localités).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Quatre ordres de résultats démontrent l’incompréhension de la demande et explique la persistance des BNS. D’abord, l’approche de la performance induit la traduction d’une offre inadéquate car les acteurs pour avoir de bons indicateurs, rationalisent leur performance. Ce qui leur permet de ne pas enregistrer de ruptures mais empêche à la cliente d’accéder à son contraceptif. Par ailleurs, sur le plan institutionnel, la focalisation sur les méthodes longues durées renforce une idée de création du chiffre qui ne traduit pas forcément la satisfaction des populations. Ensuite, la formulation d’une l’offre caractérisée par une disponibilité du service et de l’information sur la PF mais pas par la promotion de son utilisation et la compréhension politique de la demande ne correspondent pas à la préférence des femmes. Les prestataires sont plus formés à l’insertion qu’au retrait. De plus, dans un contexte marqué par la mobilité des populations, la discontinuité du service entrave l’accès à la contraception.  Puis, la gestion des normes par les prestataires participe à la persistance de l’insatisfaction car ils ne se référent pas uniquement à une logique pasteurienne, leur appartenance à un milieu social implique une réadaptation des savoirs scientifiques et culturels. Le principe du libre choix n’est pas toujours respecté, le choix peut être orienté. S’y ajoute le manque d’infrastructures qui empêche de garder l’intimité lors des consultations. Enfin, les perceptions et représentations sur les services PF sont largement définies par la communication sur les produits contraceptifs.  </p><p>Mots clés : Sciences sociales, Sénégal, planification familiale, besoins non-satisfaits, offre, demande</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Cette étude montre que la persistance des BNS s’explique par des déterminants localisés de la demande à l’offre. Par une ethnographie de la demande, elle offre une typologie des demandeuses et demandeurs qui traduit une concurrence des logiques contraceptives selon des caractéristiques sociodémographiques particulières (a situation matrimoniale, l'âge, le sexe et le statut de parent).</p><p>Au-delà des interventions, plusieurs facteurs contextuels ont contribué à l’augmentation de la demande. La PF est perçue comme un mécanisme de régulation sociale (permet aux célibataires de ne pas tomber enceinte) et un facteur de bien-être qui ne se limite pas uniquement au contrôler de la fécondité. Les représentations liées à l’esthétique du corps de la femme sont parfois un motif de recours à la PF. Par ailleurs, les sages-femmes sont très sollicitées par les nombreuses interventions, ce qui n’est pas sans incidences sur la qualité des services qu’elles délivrent dans les PPS.</p><p>Notre recherche attire l’attention sur l’intérêt pour les institutions de développer des approches par le « bas » qui partent de la sollicitude des populations. Une déconstruction par les catégories émiques de la notion d’Evidence Base Medecine permet de tendre vers l’Evidence Based Social.  La prise en compte de la spécificité de chaque zone (migration) est nécessaire à la formulation d’une réponse adéquate à une demande spécifique qui découle des différences contextuelles. En tenant compte de la demande effectivement exprimée par les femmes et à leurs spécificités, les institutions et les politiques pourraient aspirer à faire du libre choix une réalité vécue.</p>",

      "title": "Reproductive life planning implications for sexual and gender minority individuals in urban India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Reproductive life plans of sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals are largely missing from research.  “Sexual and gender minority” encompasses lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations as well as those whose sexual orientation, gender identity and expressions, or reproductive development varies from traditional, societal, or cultural norms.  SGM individuals often face discrimination and marginalization that affects their overall health and relationships. In the context of India, a number of different stigmas may affect individuals. Although India is diverse, patriarchy (in which men are preferred and given more privileges) is widespread, resulting in subjugated of non-male genders. Additionally, same-sex sexual behavior is criminalized in India. Individuals may also face discrimination based on caste or class, religion, educational level, among other factors.  Regarding sexuality, research and interventions for SGM populations focus primarily on prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI), particularly for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women. Current contraceptive and barrier use (e.g. condoms, dental dams) dialogues have left little space for discussions of pleasure. In order to add individual agency and a broader view of sexuality, this study examines reproductive life plans and influences on contraceptive and barrier use for SGM individuals in urban India.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>How does sexual and gender minority <em>status</em> influence reproductive life planning for sexual and gender minority <em>individual</em>s in urban India?</p><p>What are the influences on contraception and condom use for sexual and gender minority individuals in urban India?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study used community-based participatory research approaches, in partnership with Indian non-governmental organizations – Nirangal (a Chennai-based human rights organization focused on SGM issues) and Kolkata Rista (a Kolkata-based SGM service and advocacy organization).  In December 2017, interviews with 27 individuals (13 women, 2 men, 4 trans, and 8 gender fluid/non-binary individuals) and five focus group discussions (totaling 33 participants: 8 women, 11 men, 13 trans and 1 gender fluid/non-binary individuals) were conducted in urban areas of India (Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata). All participants either did not identify as ‘heterosexual’ and/or did not identify as ‘cisgender’ (meaning that their gender did not correspond to the sex they were assigned at birth). We developed the interview and focus group discussion guides in collaboration with community partners. Interviews were conducted in participants’ preferred language (English, Hindi, Tamil, and/or Bangla) by a team of researchers including three public health researchers from the United States and four SGM community partners in India. Transcriptions were coded using inductive thematic analyses based on the interview and focus group guides. Coding was performed using Dedoose online software with a team of four trained coders. Each interview or focus group discussion was coded by two coders.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Many participants described family pressure to have children in the context of married, different-sex partnerships. Though some individuals had children from previous or current partnerships, many had vague or non-existent parenting intentions. Sexual minority men were more likely to be married and have children, in part due to masculine gender norms. For gender minority individuals, parenthood was either undesired or described as a stressful idea.</p><p>For some sexual minority female participants in same-sex relationships, having children seemed impossible despite desires to parent.  This was in part due to political contexts that preclude same-sex marriage and formal family formation with same-sex partners. Many participants also reported concerns about parenting due to practical considerations, such as financial concerns and desires to leave the country. Thus, for some SGM in India, family “planning” was not relevant, due to more pressing matters of marginalization and stigma.</p><p>Many participants reported different-gender sexual encounters, regardless of self-identified sexual orientation. Condoms were the most common reported contraceptive and barrier method used. Participants commonly reported a lack of knowledge about STI risk for sexual interactions between female partners; the lack of knowledge caused stress for some participants. Though some participants had heard of dental dams, few had used them. Female participants frequently relied on emergency contraception in lieu of other hormonal methods due to perceptions of hormone-related risk and lack of access. Participants primarily reported finding information about sexual health for SGM individuals via the internet.</p><p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study has implications for broadening family planning dialogues in India beyond a heteronormative context. A myopic focus on disease (such as HIV and other STI) for SGM individuals (specifically men who have sex with men and trans women) in India has left gaps in awareness around their broader sexual health needs. Though few participants reported wanting other contraceptive and protective options in this study, previous research in India identified the lack of options (beyond condoms, a limited range of contraceptive pills, and the copper IUD) as a barrier to use. Contraceptive barriers are a concern for unmarried women in India, and sexual minority women are perceived as unmarried regardless of partner status. Lack of information about STI prevention between female partners represents an opportunity for education. SGM individuals in India are marginalized and, because of the heavy burden of stigma, have limited options in sanctioned family planning. The uncertain and limited parenthood options created stress for many participants, as it impeded their ability to achieve future family goals. This may be a consideration for sensitization of counselors and therapists addressing SGM issues in this context. These findings suggest that more dynamic methods of conceptualizing reproductive ‘planning’ may be needed to encompass the experiences of individuals outside of typical heteronormative relationships. As conceptualizations of reproductive justice further inform our understanding of human rights in the context of family formation, there is a need for health care providers to better address the pregnancy prevention and fertility needs of SGM in India and other global areas.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The HIV pandemic created an enormous challenge to the survival of mankind worldwide. The Ethiopian national estimate for the HIV positive pregnant women was 38,404 for the year 2012, and there were an estimated 12,000 new HIV infections among children in the same year.</p><p>Contraception offers women, their families, and communities a variety of benefits. For HIV-positive women who do not want to become pregnant, contraception has the added benefit of reducing HIV-positive births and, by extension, the number of children needing HIV-related services. Despite its demonstrable contribution, far less attention has been given to prevention of unintended pregnancy as a strategy to PMTCT.</p><p>Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the level of unmet need for contraception among HIV positive women and to understand factors that can lead to unmet need if evidence-based strategies to reduce the unmet need in this population are to be implemented.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>To determine the level and contributing factors of unmet need for contraception among HIV positive women in the ART clinic of Saint Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1/2016-November 30/2016. An exit interview of 348 sampled HIV positive women of reproductive age (15–49 years) who are married or in union enrolled at ART clinic of SPHMMC was done using structured and pre-tested questionnaire.</p><p>The most recent and standard definition of unmet need published in 2012 by the DHS analytical studies was used. Total demand for contraception refers to women with unmet need plus the percentage of currently using contraception (representing “met need”). The proportion of demand satisfied was calculated as the percentage of women using contraception divided by the percentage of women with demand for contraception whereas the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods was calculated as the percentage of women using modern contraception divided by the percentage of women with demand for contraception.</p><p>Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 for windows. Descriptive analysis was used to describe the data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of possible explanatory variables over unmet need for contraception was carried out. Important associations (odds ratio, confidence intervals, and <em>p</em>-value) were also calculated. (<em>p</em></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The overall unmet need for contraception was 25.1% of which 16.1% was for spacing and 9% for limiting. The contraceptive utilization (“met need”) was 33.5%. The total demand for contraception was calculated to be 58.6% (37.9% had demand for spacing and 20.7% for limiting). The proportion of demand satisfied was found to be 57.1%.</p><p>The most common reasons for non-use among those with unmet need were exposure-related resulting in perceived low risk of pregnancy. These include infrequent sex and not being married.</p><p>The desire for children with HIV care providers was discussed with 198 (59.3%) of study participants whereas only 166 (49.7%) discussed the use of a contraceptive method.</p><p>Among the 112 contraceptive users, the most commonly used methods were implants (33%) and injectables (22.3%). Male condom was used by 20.5% whereas pills were used by 13.4% of the study participants. Utilization of IUD and female sterilization was low at 6.3% and 2.7% respectively. Only 2 (1.8%) women used rhythm method constituting for all the traditional contraceptive methods. Thus, the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods was found to be 56.1%.</p><p>Unmet need was more common in unmarried women and those who did not discuss about contraception with HIV care provider. Making a joint decision on contraceptive utilization with a partner and having sero-discordant partner were associated with decreased odds of both overall unmet need and unmet need for dual contraceptive method. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Though the overall unmet need for contraception among HIV positive women is similar to the national figure of 25.3%, it is significantly higher than the 10.6% unmet need of the general population in Addis Ababa according to the EDHS 2011. This shows broader demand for contraception and the need for new strategies to address the contraceptive need among HIV positive clients. Indeed, the prevention of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV is one of the World Health Organization (WHO) four elements of the comprehensive approach to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p><p>The most frequently stated reasons for non-use among women with unmet need were mainly related to a perception that they had a low risk of pregnancy due to infrequent sexual activity and not being married. Appropriate counseling that explores beliefs about the risk of pregnancy and addresses misconceptions could, therefore, improve contraceptive use.</p><p>Findings from this study indicate how significant male partner involvement is in addressing contraceptive use among HIV positive women. These calls for strategies that focus on men as well as women. Encouraging communication between couples and increasing male partner involvement through a renewed focus on couples counseling are key in addressing the unmet need in general and dual method use in particular.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In the London Summit on family planning 2012, India pledged not only to provide family planning services to 48 million additional women but also to sustain the current coverage of over 100 million users till 2020. Sustaining current users is crucial for increasing level of modern contraceptive prevalence (mCPR) in any population. Many women discontinue method use without switching to any other method, despite their desire to avoid pregnancy. This premature discontinuation contributes to unmet need for family planning. Studying contribution of contraceptive discontinuation (past users) to current unmet need is important from many perspectives. First, identifying and stopping women from discontinuation of modern methods will reduce the burden of unmet need. Second, contraceptive discontinuation among women who still wants to delay pregnancy indicates ineffectiveness of family planning programs. While, the family planning programs are mainly concerned about awareness and accessibility of contraceptives, the program strategy seldom consider requirements of women discontinuing method use. These women who once overcame all awareness and access related obstacles and used modern method but stopped using it after a while. One of the reasons could be that they had inadequate counselling on how to use a method or how to handle side effects. In</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>At present, contraceptive discontinuation rate for modern reversible methods in India is 44 percent. If this high rate of discontinuation continues, many current users of family planning will soon become part of non-users group and thereby will contribute to unmet need of contraception. The present paper tries to examine following research questions; What is the contribution of past users of modern methods to unmet need? What are the reasons for not using any method among past users in comparison to never users with unmet need?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this cross-sectional analysis is drawn from the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015-16 in India. For the current analysis, married women are divided into three categories women who never used a modern method, who used a modern method in the past but are not using at the time of survey, and who are using a modern method at the time of survey.</p><p>The definition for unmet need used in this analysis includes women with current unmet need as well as those who are currently using traditional methods. This definition is aligned with FP2020 targets which are focused on users of modern methods. Using information on women with current unmet need and whether they used any modern method in the past, contribution of past users to current unmet need is calculated.</p><p>Logistic and linear regression analysis are performed to understand predictors of contribution of contraceptive discontinuation to unmet need.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, 13% of women in India have expressed unmet need for modern methods which goes up to 18% when traditional method users are included. The contribution of past users of modern methods to current unmet need is 24% at the national level. This contribution ranges from 9% in Bihar to 58% in Punjab. The contribution is higher in urban areas (51%) as compared to rural areas (46%); higher among educated women (26%) as compared to women with no education (18%). Proportion of women with unmet need who discontinued a method increases with increasing age and parity.  </p><p>State level regression suggests that higher the use of modern reversible method, higher is the contribution by past users to current unmet need. For example- maximum contribution of past users to current unmet need was in the state of Punjab (58%) which also has high prevalence of modern reversible methods.</p><p>The reported fertility and health related reasons for nonuse among past users of modern methods was higher than never users of modern methods. Health-related reasons are reported by only 7% of never users with unmet need as compared to 12% of past users with unmet need. Knowledge about methods/sources, access to services and opposition by family are more of the issue with never users of modern methods.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Present analysis suggests that discontinuation of modern methods in the past have contributed to almost quarter of the current unmet need. In the analyses, women with unmet need are segregated into two subgroups i.e. past users of modern method with unmet need and never users of modern method with unmet need. Such segregation of unmet need highlights the need for differential strategy to work with the two groups of women.</p><p>High reporting of side effects and health concerns by past users with unmet need as compared to never users indicate gaps in counselling of women regarding family planning. Past users are citing these concerns based on their own experiences. If these women had more information or complete counseling on side effects, they may have been in better position to handle the issues. Or discontinue use of contraception altogether and switch to other method.</p><p>The emphasis on promoting the use of modern reversible methods in India and elsewhere needs to identify and implement strategies to address the contraceptive discontinuation and the management of side effects. Without such an approach, meeting FP2020 goal could be a challenge. </p>",

      "title": "Determinants of Contraceptive Discontinuation and Switching among Female Garment Factory Workers in Cambodia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Approximately 85% of the 700,000 workers employed in the Cambodian garment industry are women, a majority of whom are rural-urban migrants of reproductive age. Despite enjoying some legal protections, female garment workers (FGWs) face unique challenges, such as unstable employment, stringent working conditions, and limited access to quality health services and information.</p><p>FGWs have been observed to possess distinct characteristics from the general population of women in Cambodia, including in their contraceptive use practices. Currently married FGWs use contraceptives at significantly higher rates than the general population. While the number of FGWs who discontinue contraceptive use is notably lower, the rate of switching between traditional and modern methods is markedly higher. These characteristics point to the uniqueness of the contraceptive use dynamics and needs of this group of women.</p><p>Evidence consistently has shown that women discontinue contraceptive use due to method failure, method-related problems, side-effects or health concerns, desire for pregnancy, or no further need. Other influential factors include age, employment, education, parity and quality of care. However, little is known about factors influencing contraceptive practices of FGWs, who are mostly migrants facing pressures to maintain demanding jobs and to establish fertility.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The present study aims to identify determinants of contraceptive practices among currently married FGWs with regard to contraceptive discontinuation and switching. The analysis focuses on well-recognized conventional factors and distinct factors specific to this vulnerable working population.</p><p>We hypothesize that, controlling for effects of conventional factors, specific factors of migration, longer employment tenure, and lower parity discourage continuation of contraceptive use for different reasons. However, lower-parity FGWs who migrate with their spouses and have shorter employment tenure are more likely to maintain their contraceptive use.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this study comes from a cross-sectional structured survey of FGWs conducted by the Population Council’s Evidence Project under the USAID funded WorkerHealth project in Cambodia. A total of 1004 FGWs of reproductive age (aged 18-49) from five partner factories in Phnom Penh and Kandal provinces were randomly selected from March to May 2017. Our analytical sample was restricted to currently married women (656 workers) as only a negligible proportion of unmarried women in the sample reported that they were sexually active. The study obtained ethical approvals from the Population Council’s Institutional Review Board and the National Ethics Committee for Health Research in Cambodia.</p><p>We analyze relationships between contraceptive outcome variables and explanatory variables. Dichotomous outcome variables include any discontinuation, 12-month discontinuation, 24-month discontinuation and beyond, and switching including modern-to-traditional and vice-versa. Explanatory variables include socio-demographic characteristics, migration, cohabitation, employment tenure, income, parity, contraceptive-related knowledge and decision-making, and quality of family planning services. </p><p>FGWs using contraceptives are categorized into traditional-users, oral contraceptive-users, and users of other modern methods including LARCs. Analysis on discontinuation and switching as it relates to specific methods will also be conducted.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We present preliminary results drawn from descriptive statistics. On average, FGW in the study (N=656) sample were 30.9 years old, had a primary-level of education, and had between 1-2 children (70%). More than half of the sample were migrants (56.9%) with employment tenure longer than one year (66%) and average monthly wages of $203. Out of the 656 sampled workers, 557 FGWs had used ever contraceptives (18.3% always traditional method, 51.2% always modern method, and 30.5% switching between the two methods). In our sample, we observe that 18.7% among all contraceptive users discontinued use during the course of their lifetime contraceptive use. Among those using only traditional methods, the proportion discontinuing was 24.5%, while the same figure for FGWs using only modern methods was 41.4%.</p><p>Migrant FGWs discontinued their contraceptive use at higher rates than non-migrant FGWs. However, if they migrated with their spouse, their discontinuation rates were lower. While both groups expressed strong desire for future contraceptive use, non-migrant FGWs expressed less need. FGWs with employment tenures shorter than one year discontinued contraceptives at lower rates less than their counterparts with longer tenures and did so during first 12 months of use. Lowest-parity workers had the highest share of discontinuing users relative to their higher parity counterparts. Most of the discontinuation was during the first 12 months of use. Multivariable analyses will be conducted to further analyze these relationships controlling for effects of other explanatory variables.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Many efforts have been made to understand contraceptive use dynamics among the general population of Cambodian women by using data of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). However, the DHS does not allow for disaggregated analysis, in particular for workers employed in the garment sector. The finding that a significant share of FGWs still rely on traditional methods and often discontinue their use of modern methods is a cause for concern. While discontinuation for desired fertility is not problematic, discontinuation due to other reasons puts FGWs at risk of unintended pregnancies that may interrupt their employment and livelihoods. This study will be the first to rigorously examine determinants of contraceptive discontinuation and switching among FGWs in Cambodia. This new evidence will inform the development of policies and programs that can help Cambodian FGWs meet their work and family obligations and goals. A better understanding of contraceptive use behaviors among FGWs as a special, large and economically important subgroup of the Cambodian population will also help ensure that FP2020 targets are achieved and that the garment sector remains productive and competitive, continuing its contributions to Cambodia’s growing economy.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The 2015 global report on contraceptive use revealed that 64% of women of reproductive age were using contraceptive methods. However, 38% of those women stopped using contraception within the first year, and over 50% within two years. In East Africa, one in three couples is likely to discontinue using contraceptives within the first year. Uganda and Ethiopia have the highest discontinuation rates (43% and 42% respectively). Dissatisfaction with the side effects of any given method is the most common reason couples discontinue contraceptive use in East Africa.   </p><p>Although Rwanda has made progress in increasing uptake of modern contraceptives rates among married women (45% in 2010 to 47.5% in 2015) still, 28% of cohabiting women discontinued using contraceptives within the first year. This rate has been fairly stable over the last years. Only one-fourth switched to a new method and 61% of women completely stopped using contraceptive methods. Although the major reasons for discontinuation are known, more clarity is needed on the linkage of discontinuation and sociodemographic parameters.</p><p>It is for these reasons that the Rwandan Ministry of Health (MoH) conducted a national study to improve the understanding of the driving factors of contraceptive discontinuation, and provide recommendations for policies interventions.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The 2015 Demographic Health Survey reported that 61% completely stopped using contraception, while there still is a need for it.</p><p>A study was conducted in November 2017 by the School of Public Health with support from the MoH, and was funded by the UNFPA, in order to identify the statistically associated factors to modern contraceptive discontinuation among women of reproductive age who have ever used FP methods, and are cohabitating with their partner, as well as the linkage between discontinuation and sociodemographic parameters.</p><p>This study will contribute to the design of tailored interventions and address the unmet needs of women.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study used a cross-sectional analytical design with both quantitative and qualitative approaches. This study used a multistage random selection technique to select six districts, three have a very low contraceptive rate while the three other selected districts have a high contraceptive rate. This was followed by a second random selection, after which 128 clusters were selected. In each cluster, 27 households were selected that have at least one woman in child bearing age and is cohabiting with her partner, a systematic random sampling was used. As primary target 3459 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) were involved in the study.</p><p>To allow triangulation, three different methods were used to collect primary data: i) general questionnaire for the primary target group, ii) focus group discussion with women of similar age groups, partners of these women, community health workers and youth, iii) key informant interviews with youth and health providers.</p><p>The analysis was done by using Stata. Only covariates that were statistically significant in unadjusted binary logistic regression model (using Odds ratio and a 95% CI), were included in the multivariate binary logistic regression. Thematic analysis where used for qualitative data and triangulation was applied to confront quantitative with qualitative data.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The study found that 2154 (74.6%) women who have ever used contraceptives, also discontinued. This number is higher than previous studies on Rwanda and the East-Africa region have shown. Discontinuation was more prevalent among women aged 35-39 (82.9%), in urban areas (75.8%), illiterate women (80.2%), without health insurance (68.4%) and with the lowest income (79.4%).  </p><p>Injectable contraceptives are the most prevalent method to discontinue (62.1%), followed by oral contraceptive pills (2.7%). The reasons for discontinuing were side effects (45.2%, n=2154), need for having another child (35.9%), switching to another method (5.3%) and method failure (5.1%).</p><p>After adjustment, Rusizi was significantly associated with FP discontinuation, this is concerning as the district is known for having a low contraceptive rate. The need for an (additional) child was a key factor for contraceptive discontinuation, up to four times more than those who didn’t wanted more children (with aOR: 4.91, 95% CI: [3.53,6.82], p<p>Interestingly, 77.6 % of women who stopped using FP methods in these districts are from Protestant (Pentecostals, Baptist, Methodist) and they have 1.32% more chance to discontinue contraceptives than Catholic women.</p><p>These finding were confirmed by the FGD and KII, which highlighted the weak management of side effects, religious beliefs and long distance to reach the nearest FP delivery point.</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Findings from this study show that key determinants of contraceptive discontinuation include the need for more children, even for women who already have 3-4 children, religious based misconceptions especially among protestant, inaccurate information related to low-education and negative side effects.</p><p>An unexpected finding was, that the wish for an (additional) child is the most important factor to discontinue contraceptive use, although this seems a logical reason, Rwanda’s total fertility rate is 4.2. Under the 2050 Demographic Dividend Agenda, Rwanda aims for a fertility rate <p>This calls for FP programme designers to formulate specific interventions to address barriers related to culture and religious beliefs, support outreach services that can facilitate the users who are need to walk a long distance to the nearest health facility. There is a need to strengthen the capacity of health providers to offer quality FP counselling, correct management of side effects, and the provision of long acting methods as they are less prevalent in contraceptive discontinuation.</p></p>",

      "title": "Effect of counselling for side-effects by health care personnel on continuation of contraceptive use",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Users of reversible contraceptive methods often discontinue the method due to side effects, which is the most frequent method-related reason for  discontinuation. According to National Family Health Survey 2015-16, in India, 11% episode of pill use, 9% episode of IUCD/PPIUCD use, and 15% episode of injectable use were discontinued due to side-effects or health concerns. While using a contraceptive method, a user may experience health problems related to the method sometimes the user expresses health concerns which are not related to the method. However, all these health concerns need proper counselling by providers or health care workers, so that users can properly manage the side effects, continue use of the method, or if necessary, switch to other effective methods. If not counselled properly, users are more likely to discontinue the method and even discontinue contraceptive use.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study examines how the experience of side effects can lead to contraceptive discontinuation and how discontinuation due to side effects can be moderated by the counselling from the providers and health workers.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>These data come from a longitudinal study of 2,306 participants from Odisha and Haryana, India, who started using four modern reversible methods: PPIUCD, interval IUCD, injectable contraceptive, and oral contraceptive pill, within one month prior to study recruitment. The participants were followed-up three months after their recruitment and their contraceptive use at that timepoint was recorded. At the three-month follow-up they were also asked about all the side effects they had experienced. The experience of side effects related to the method they started using at recruitment was identified. The participants also reported whether they talked to any provider or health worker regarding their side effects or discontinuation of the method that they were using. The direct effect of side effects on continuation of the method at recruitment and continuation of the modern contraceptive method were calculated using logistic regression models. The moderation effect of counselling by providers or health workers on the relationship between side effects and contraceptive continuation was also calculated.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Approximately 84% of participants continued using the same method after three months and 4% switched to a different modern method. Thus modern method use at 3-month follow-up was 88%. Approximately 17% of respondents reported that they experienced any side effect but only 10% of respondents reported side effects related to the method that they were using. About 11% of respondents talked to providers or health workers about side effects or health concerns or about discontinuing the method they were using. Women who experienced side effects had higher odds (OR=12.84, CI:9.48-17.39) of talking to a provider or a health worker to discuss side effects or discontinuation. Women who experienced side effects had 4.87 (3.68-6.43) times the odds of discontinuing the method and 3.56 (2.61-4.84) times the odds of not using any modern method after three months follow-up compared to those who did not experience side effects. However, the odds of discontinuation decreased when the women talked to a provider or health worker about side effects or discontinuation. After moderation, the odds ratio for discontinuing the recruitment method comparing women who experienced side effects to those who did not was 2.12 (1.51-2.97), and for discontinuation of use of any modern method was 1.72 (1.2-2.48).  The decrease in odds after moderation suggests that that counselling does moderate the relationship between side effects and discontinuation. The counselling and the recommendation from the provider and health workers also shows association with the dynamics of contraceptive use. The moderation effect of counselling was highest among PPIUCD</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study demonstrates the importance of follow-up counselling on continuation of contraceptive use. The association of experience of side effects and discontinuation of contraceptive use is well established, however, the literature on the effect of follow-up care on contraceptive continuation is limited and inconclusive (Steenland et al. 2013). The findings of this study showed that both discontinuation of contraceptive use and counselling from a provider or health worker are strongly associated with the experience of side effects. The association of contraceptive discontinuation and contact with provider or health worker had a positive unadjusted association probably due to an antagonistic effect. This analysis explained how counselling with a provider or a health worker can be helpful in reducing discontinuation of the recruitment method, if not, at least adherence to use of any modern contraceptive. As these respondents have all used contraception, they have already overcome the barriers for non-use so it is important to provide follow-up care to reduce discontinuation, especially due to method related reasons. Follow-up care, therefore, should be a part of any contraceptive service, regardless of whether the method is clinical or non-clinical, to improve the continuation rate of contraceptive use.</p>",

      "title": "One-year continuation rates of postpartum intra-uterine contraceptive device: results from a prospective cohort study in India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Short intervals between births of less than 36 months are linked with higher maternal and child mortality (Rutstein 2008). Family planning (FP) can avert nearly one-third of maternal deaths and 10% of child mortality when couples space their births at least three years apart (Cleland 2006). In India, the National Family Health Survey-3 reported that 61% of births were spaced less than three years apart, and approximately 65% of women in the first year postpartum reported an unmet need for FP (Borda 2009). To address this high unmet need, the Government of India has rapidly scaled up postpartum intra-uterine contraceptive device (PPIUCD) program.</p><p>There is limited evidence on continuation rates of PPIUCD at one year. The existing studies (Celen S. 2004 &amp; Kumar 2018 [currently under review]) are confined to controlled environments in health facilities and there is a need to generate evidence on continuation rates achieved in ‘real world settings’ through large-scale programs. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p><strong>This study is part of a broader study from a large-scale public health program to expand access to Comprehensive IUCD services (PPIUCD, Interval IUCD &amp; Post Abortion IUCD) in India (EAISI) funded by Large Anonymous Donor in the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh.</strong></p><p>The primary objective of the study is to determine one-year continuation rates and reported complication rates of PPIUCDs in the context of a large-scale PPIUCD program.</p><p>Secondary objectives are:</p><ul>\t<li>To determine the continuation rates of PPIUCD among clients at 6 weeks and 6 months following insertion.</li>\t<li>To identify factors contributing to discontinuation of PPIUCD within one year of insertion. </li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Location, Study design, time frame and sample size:</strong> A one-year prospective cohort study was conducted from September 2015 to January 2017 across 100 public health facilities in India. The sample size was based on an estimate of 60% one-year PPIUCD continuation rates (76%, cited by Celen S 2004).  With alpha error 0.05, power  80%, precision  5%, design effect of 1.9 and expected loss to follow up as 40%, the estimated sample size was 981 which was rounded off to 1000. The study was approved by IRBs of Johns Hopkins School of Public and State Governments.</p><p><strong>Data source and client enrolment</strong>: The first ten women from each selected facility receiving a PPIUCD and giving consent for participating in the study were enrolled. They were followed up using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year after insertion.</p><p><strong>Analysis approach</strong>: Life table analysis was used to estimate the probabilities of PPIUCD continuation at various time points. Simple frequencies and percentages were used to describe follow up rates and outcomes. We used Kaplan- Meier analysis to compare the continuation (survival) of PPIUCD between groups and determined statistical significance using the log-rank test. Stata 13 was used to conduct the statistical analysis.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<ul>\t<li>Out of the total 1000 women enrolled into the study, 916 women could be reached at first follow up (6 weeks), 840 women could be reached at second follow up (6 months) and 727 women could be reached at third follow up (1 year).</li>\t<li>The mean age of women was 23.8 years-old, ranging between 18 years to 42 years-old.</li>\t<li>More than half of them had one living child (52.3%) while 47% had two or more living children at the time of the study.  </li>\t<li>The PPIUCD continuation rates estimated using the life table analysis at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year are 88.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 86.6 -90.7), 74.8% (95% CI 71.8– 77.6) and 60.4% (95% CI 56.9- 63.8), respectively.</li>\t<li>During the course of our study, a total of 110 women (12%) reported expulsion of PPIUCD whereas 214 women (23%) reported removal of PPIUCD within one year of insertion.</li>\t<li>Out of the 214 removals, most (48%) were due to symptoms like excessive bleeding, pain or discharge post insertion followed by the desire to use another method (20%).</li>\t<li>Of all the women who got their PPICUD removed, around half (44%) had switched over to another method at the time of their last follow up. Most of them (42%) had opted for sterilization or oral contraceptive pills (31%) (n=95 women).</li>\t<li>The mean continuation period of PPIUCD among women who reported being counseled on PPIUCDs before insertion was higher in comparison to those who did not although this difference was not statistically significant. (p-value = 0.42). </li></ul>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This Study being a prospective cohort study, adds substantially to the existing knowledge on IUCD discontinuation and contraceptive dynamics; which are mostly based on retrospective studies or secondary data analysis of demographic and health surveys.</p><p>PPIUCD continuation rates achieved in this study within the context of a large-scale program is comparable to those of other Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives. The finding corroborates well with the findings of another retrospective study which was conducted across six states of India (Kumar 2018 [currently under review]) and reports a PPIUCD continuation rate of 62.8% at one year.</p><p>The major reasons for early discontinuation among users were symptoms like excessive bleeding, pain, and discharge post-insertion. These common causes are clinically manageable with simple medications and proper pre- and post-insertion counseling.</p><p>Incorporating pre and post insertion counseling as an integral part of IUCD services and strengthening them will ensure an enabling environment for the client and keep her motivated to continue with IUCD as her method of choice.</p>",

      "title": "Prevalence and factors associated with contraceptive discontinuation among young women aged 15-24 in Rwanda: a secondary data analysis of Rwanda Demographic and Health survey 2014-2015.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The 2015 global report on contraceptive use revealed that 64% of women of reproductive age were using contraceptive methods. However, 38% of those women stopped using contraception within the first year. In East Africa, one in three couples is likely to discontinue using contraceptives within the first year.</p><p>Rwanda is a youthful country with  22.7% of youth aged between 14-24 years and about 7% of women gave their first birth by age 18 while 43% gave birth by age 22 in 2015. Many efforts are used to influence young people to adopt positive sexual behaviors and use of modern contraceptives but still it is at a low level for those sexually active ( 11,6% and 34,3% aged 15-19 and 20-24 respectively). Unmet needs for family planning is at 3,4% and 7,2% for the respective age.</p><p>Rwanda DHS of 2014-2015 showed that 28% of women who started using contraceptive methods discontinued within one year. Possible reasons for discontinuation  were methods failure, experiencing side effects, desire for fertility like in other countries. The knowledge of prevalence and risk factors for contraceptive discontinuation among young women aged 15-24 are rarely investigated. Such information would help to improve Family Planning program.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study aimed to measure the magnitude of contraceptive discontinuation, type of method discontinued, potential reasons and factors associated to contraceptive discontinuation among young women aged 15-24 in Rwanda.</p><p>Given an increase in contraceptive prevalence rate realized in  Family Planning program, it is important for programs to assess contraceptive discontinuation, especially among young women aged 15-24 who are concerned with various life determinants not similar to older women. Besides, the age of the population we recall that nearly one in four Rwandans is a youth between 14-24 years who are likely to influence population increase through unintended deliveries.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study was based on a secondary data analysis of a recent Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS) conducted between November 2014 and April 2015. This was a nationally representative cross sectional household survey. A two-stage sampling was used to reach to a nationally representative sample.  Analysis for this study was based on a sample of 796 women who had ever used contraceptive methods. They were selected among 5,252 currently married women and sexually active unmarried girls aged 15-24 at the time of the Survey.</p><p>Key outcome measures were prevalence of contraceptive discontinuation, methods discontinued, reasons for discontinuation and factors associated with contraceptive discontinuation. Descriptive analysis was conducted using frequencies and percentages.</p><p> Logistic regressions were also used to determine factors associated with contraceptive discontinuation. Finally, multiple logistic regressions using forward stepwise was conducted in order to have a final model of significant risk factors of contraceptive discontinuation among women aged 15-24. Variables were considered to be statistically significant based on their Odd Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI). Data were analyzed using Stata version 13.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Women aged 15 to 24 who had ever used contraceptive methods were 796. Most women were between 20-24 years (89.4%) and married or living with partners (71.5%). Regarding education status, most women had attained primary level education (72.9%) and secondary level education (21.6%). A higher number of women lived in rural area (73.7%), affiliated with Protestant religion (48.5%), classified in poor category of wealth index (44.1%) and had one child (64.7%). </p><p>The prevalence of contraceptive discontinuation was 45%. Injection was the most discontinued method with 60.1% followed by pills (28.4%). Reasons for contraceptive discontinuation were experiencing side effects (33%), wanting to become pregnant (28.4%), accessibility and availability of  methods of contraception (0.9%) and husband disapproval (0.6%).</p><p> In multiple logistic regressions, women with primary level of education were two times more likely to discontinue contraceptive methods [OR=2.13, 95% CI:(1.10-4.11)] than their counter parts, married women or in union with a partner were also three times more likely to discontinue [OR=3.23, 95% CI: (1.43-7.28)] compared to unmarried ones. Women who reported having two children were five times more likely to discontinue contraceptive methods [OR=5.34, 95% CI: (3.28-8.69)] than women who have one child. Women who reported not having been told about side effects were almost two times more likely to discontinue  methods of contraception [(OR=1.7, 95% CI:1.07-2.70)] than women who were told about side effects.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Findings from the study show that four in ten women between  15-24 years who started contraceptive methods, discontinue within one year of method initiation. Discontinuation is more observed on short acting hormonal methods such as injections and pills where experiencing side effects is among reasons for method discontinuation.</p><p>Factors associated with contraceptive discontinuation were women with low education level, married or in union, having two children, and have no information about side effects of contraceptive methods. This implies that three elements need to be improved aiming to provide quality of family planning services for women between 15-24 years.  </p><p>First is the improvement of quality of counseling and provision of alternative method of contraception to increase contraceptive uptake and continuation. The second aspect is to give comprehensive information about different methods and their possible side effects. It is important to ensure that young women are adequately informed about possible side effects of each chosen method and regular follow up mechanisms are in place to mitigate such effects or switch to another methods where needed.</p><p>Finally, modeled counseling and education on contraceptive methods tailored to specific women categories should be considered. Women with low level of education and living in rural areas have to be given much attention in education and counseling to ensure that they are reached with the right information that address rumors and myth around contraceptive methods. Further studies should explore factors affecting  contraceptive use related to social and cultural norms such as husband’s role  and desire for many children.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning discontinuation is frequently cited as a contributor to unmet need as well as an indicator of (poor) quality of counseling.  However, it is not clearly understood what happens in the medium term and longer term after a woman has discontinued family planning use.  Jain (2017) has written that addressing the “leaky bucket” of discontinuation would help reduce unmet need.  This study “follows” women in Rwanda after they have discontinued in the longer run – do they remain non-users forever, do they become pregnant, give birth and the take up postpartum family planning, etc.  Although the challenge mentioned above is well known to most all FP advocates there is a clear deficit in quantitative analysis at the country level in any country to understand the issue.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The DHS series includes month by month information on contraceptive use for each women interviewed for the five years preceding the survey.  This “calendar” allows the identification of family use patterns, pregnancy, births and terminations. We use the reproductive calendar of the Rwanda 2014 DHS and linked characteristics of interviewed women including wantedness status of births included in the calendar.</p><p>In our analysis we follow women who discontinue for the longer run. For example, if a woman discontinues family planning we analyze the duration between the discontinuation and the next event which could be pregnancy or it could be uptake of a different method.  In other words, we look at what women do not only in the near term but in the longer term.  Also, we link the events to the extent possible to characteristics of the women at the time of the event and the wanted-ness of the births/pregnancies where that is a relevant characteristic of the event (i.e., pregnancy).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Among women who discontinue their current method, 23 percent immediately take up a new modern method of family planning.  About 16 percent are immediately pregnant (method failure most likely).  The remainder, about 61 percent are not using a family planning method.</p><p>Over a longer 12-month period, the percent of discontinuers who become pregnant rises to about 58 percent.  The percent who resume contraceptive use within the 12 month window is a little more than two percent. The percent who are neither pregnant nor using family planning is about 17 percent. </p><p>We also analyzed the wantedness status relative to the contraceptive failures and among the discontinuers who did not resume FP use and became pregnant within 12 months.  58 percent of the women who became pregnant immediately upon discontinuation (failures) either wanted their pregnancy later or not at all.  At 12 months post-discontinuation, excluding the failures, 28 percent of the women who became pregnant either wanted their pregnancy later or not at all.</p><p>On the other hand, postpartum women who discontinued use of family planning previous to becoming pregnant are more likely to use family planning in the postpartum period (45% for discontinuers vs 34% for non-discontinuers).</p><p>Other results to be presented at conference include disaggregations of results by key social, demographic and economic conditions &amp; use of family planning among discontinuers postpartum.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Discontinuation is a complicated and important phenomenon for understanding family planning use dynamics.   Understanding discontinuation as part of a rational process may help design better family planning programs.  In Rwanda discontinuation contributes significantly to unintended pregnancies when the discontinuation is involuntary as a result of failure or method related reasons.  On the other hand discontinuation that occurs as part of the normal achievement of fertility intentions can be seen as part of a well-planned family.  Seeing these different outcomes as different pathways that women may follow can be incorporated into counselling approaches and method availability to achieve improved family planning use and reduced unintended pregnancies.</p><p>Furthermore, this analysis is something that can be done as part of any country’s family planning program development.  As part of a comprehensive further analysis of Demographic and Heath Survey data it can be packaged into easy to understand results for incorporation into planning.</p>",

      "title": "Twelve-month contraceptive continuation among women initiating short- and long-acting reversible contraceptives in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The complex humanitarian emergencies caused by armed conflict are characterized by social disruption, population displacement and the breakdown of national health systems. In addition to their need for shelter, food, water and primary health care, women living in humanitarian settings face many sexual and reproductive health (SRH) concerns. Despite the inclusion of SRH services in the minimum standards of health care in humanitarian settings, access to SRH services, and especially to contraception, is often compromised in war. </p><p>Two decades of war and instability in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have resulted in a compromised health system. Save the Children, in collaboration with Columbia University's Reproductive Health Access, Information and Services in Emergencies (RAISE) Initiative, supports the Ministry of Health (MOH) to provide contraceptive services and post-abortion care in public health facilities in North Kivu. The program provided essential equipment, supplies and contraceptives to the facilities, as well as health provider training on contraceptive counseling and provision that addressed Bruce's six elements of quality of care.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Overall, the evidence suggests that availability of a broader range of contraceptive methods, service quality and contraceptive continuation are associated, but very little is known about continuation and switching of contraceptive methods in unstable or conflict settings. Understanding the reasons clients discontinue or continue contraceptive methods can help improve programs and ultimately contribute to helping them to effectively plan their families.  An evaluation of a contraceptive services program in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was conducted to measure 12-month contraceptive continuation by type of contraceptive method (short-acting or long-acting).</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A stratified systematic sample of women age 18 or older who initiated a contraceptive method 12-18 months prior to data collection was selected from the registers at nine supported health facilities. Community health workers or nurses visited the selected women in their homes to ask if they were willing to discuss their use of health services at the facility with an interviewer.  Once a woman agreed to participate, a trained female interviewer interviewed her in Swahili or Kinyarwanda in a private location.</p><p>The quantitative survey questionnaire included topics such as demographic characteristics; birth history; current reproductive intentions; date of, experience with and reasons for discontinuation and/or switching of methods; future intention to use for discontinuers; continuers' experience of problems with their method; and satisfaction with the services received at time of contraceptive initiation.</p><p>Discontinuation was defined as women reporting they stopped continuous use of their baseline contraceptive method within 12 months of accepting the method. Data collection took place in October and November 2015.</p><p>Key characteristics of short-acting versus long-acting method acceptors were compared using chi-square statistics for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios were estimated to assess factors associated with discontinuation.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 548 women was interviewed about their contraceptive use: 304 who began a short-acting method and 244 who began a long-acting method. LARC acceptors were slightly older than short-acting method acceptors (mean age 28.9 versus 27.5, p = .009). Half of LARC acceptors (50.4%) reported having been displaced at least once in the previous year compared to 36.5% of short-acting method acceptors (p = .001). The majority of respondents reported wanting no more children (44.3%) or to wait more than two years for their next pregnancy (36.3%).  No other socio-demographic differences were found among short- and long-acting contraceptive acceptors.</p><p>At 12 months, 81.6% women reported using their baseline contraceptive method continuously, with more long-acting than short-acting method acceptors (86.1% versus 78.0%, p = .02) continuing contraceptive use. The most common reasons given for discontinuation were that the women desired pregnancy (42.6%) or experienced side effects (32.7%).  Continuation was similarly high across age, education level and displacement status. The majority (88.3%) of women reported no prior contraceptive use.</p><p>Most women reported that their partner was aware of their contraceptive use (79.3%) and approved (79.1%). Consistent with these results, 69.9% reported the decision to use contraception was made jointly with her partner while 27.0% reported it was primarily her decision. Overall, 76.1% of women reported that the provider gave them sufficient information at time of initiation. Satisfaction with the services received when they started their contraceptive method was very high (93.6%). </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This is the first study of contraceptive continuation in a humanitarian setting. The high percentages of women continuing contraceptive use found here demonstrates that women will choose to initiate and continue use of their desired contraceptive method, even in a difficult, unstable and low contraceptive prevalence setting like North Kivu. This program attracted new users of contraception and demonstrated that these new acceptors could also be supported, as needed, to continue contraceptive use as long as they wished</p><p>While LARC acceptors were older and more likely to have been displaced in the last year, few differences in other socio-demographic characteristics between baseline contraceptive method types were found. Displaced women may be more likely to choose a LARC to avoid the need for resupply visits given the instability of their current living situation.</p><p>This evaluation lends support to the association between service quality and contraceptive continuation. A focus on service quality and efforts to address provider skills and ensure consistent availability of commodities likely contributed to the high rates of contraceptive use and continuation.  This highlights the need for multi-year funding in humanitarian settings to enable this emphasis on quality improvement. </p><p>When good quality services, with a choice of short- and long-acting contraceptives, are in place, women will not only choose to start, but also continue, to use contraception to exercise their right to reproductive choice.</p>",

      "title": "An Assessment of Health Facilities Readiness to Provide Quality Implant Removal Services in the four Districts of South Western Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uptake of implants as a Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive method in Uganda has steadily increased in recent years. The Uganda Demographic and Health survey (UDHS 2016) showed implants as the second most popular modern contraceptive method among currently married women (6%), an increase from 0.3% in 2006, and 2.7% in 2011.   Although the uptake of implants has increased, there is deficiency in service delivery capacity for removals in most public health facilities. With increased numbers of implant insertions, facilities need to be prepared to remove implants when clients wish to have them removed.   In implant trainings covering both insertions and removals, trainers may not be able to mobilize  sufficient numbers of removal clients for clinical practice, forcing providers to learn on anatomical models, but unable to achieve competency.  In addition, inadequate equipment and consumables required to perform implants removal prohibit the provider’s ability to perform the procedure even when they have the skill. Therefore, women who wish to have their implant removed wait for implementing partners mobile outreach days.  The Jhpiego-led Expanding Family Planning Choices through Quality Implants Services (ECQIS) Project conducted a health facility assessment to establish provider readiness to provide quality implant removal services to walk in clients.</p><p></p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>ECQIS conducted a baseline health facility assessment at the project start in August 2016 to determine the existence of supportive structures and systems for providing quality implant removal services. These structures and systems include implant removal equipment and supplies, trained staff, time for services provision, availability of referral mechanisms, and cost for removal services.  After one year of clinical training, ECQIS conducted an endline in December 2017 to assess the capacity of health facilities to provide implant removal services in static facility clinics. Additionally, ECQIS assessed providers’ knowledge and competencies to provide implant removal services pre and post intervention.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Health facility assessments were conducted in 48 health facilities in four districts in south western Uganda. The districts were selected because they had high volumes of implant insertions, based on available data from our partner Marie Stopes International-Uganda and DHIS2. In addition, ECQIS considered districts that did not have a resident MSIU dedicated family planning service provider that had the capacity to remove an implant.  All health facilities that provided implant insertion services participated in the project. A team of eight independent data collectors conducted interviews using the REDCap mobile phone app and data was synched and reviewed by a team of supervisors on a daily basis, upon connection to the internet.  </p><p>The project trained health providers in standard implants removals, provided equipment and consumables, and tracked implant removals during static walk-in clinics.  District Trainers administered a pre-test to 76 health providers before training on module 1 (side effects management), module 2 (standard implant removals) and before hands-on clinical skills training. Providers did a post-test training after one week for module 1 and 2 and 9-11 months post clinical training. Training data was collected on paper tools and entered in REDCap and all data was analysed using Stata13.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>After project implementation, there were substantial changes in both facility readiness and provider competency to provide quality implant removal services. There was an increase from 8% at baseline to 29% at endline in facilities that had all critical implant removal supplies for standard removal that include antiseptic (povidone iodine), anaesthetic (lidocaine without epinephrine), sterile gloves, scalpel (surgical blade), syringes, needles, straight and curved  mosquito forceps. Additional findings included an increase in the number of health facilities that had a functional referral system in place for difficult implant removal from 12.5% at baseline to 54.2% at endline; an increase in the number of facilities that offer implant removals as often as implant insertions from 54.2% to 89.6%, and an increase in the number of health facilities that record implant removals in the family planning register from 29.2% to 95.8%. At the passing score of 80% for each training module, the percentage of providers that passed module 1 (side effects management) increased from 11.1% pre-training to 76.5% post-training. The percentage of providers who passed module 2 (standard implant removals) also increased from 71.6% pre-training to 86.4% post-training, while  the percentage of trained providers who achieved competency in implant removal (after hands on clinical skills assessment) increased from 14.8 to 97 between 9-11 months post clinical training.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The majority of health facilities were not ready to provide quality implant removal services at baseline as evidenced by the low scores in the availability of required equipment and other consumables. Similarly, there were glaring knowledge and skills gaps among health providers to provide standard implant removal services, which confirmed why implant removals were conducted mainly during outreach events by implementing partners.</p><p></p><p>Based on the findings of the endline assessment, the ECQIS project has made important observations that should be considered by other projects looking to ensure access to quality implant removals. These include:</p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>The need to conduct a baseline assessment help to establish the context/the extent for which skills building on implant removals is needed</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Provision of correct equipment and consumables to facilitate learning and provision of quality implants removals within the static health facility setting</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>There is a need to ensure sufficient client case load for providers to be able to attain and maintain implant removal skills</p>\t</li></ul><p>The use of anatomic models is an excellent start when training for implants removals but needs to be complemented with practice on actual clients to build provider confidence while acquiring the new skills</p>",

      "title": "Capacity building efforts inImplant removal skills using LDHF approach in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uptake of hormonal contraceptive implants has drastically increased in sub-Saharan Africa in the past decade. The most recent PMA 2020 survey data in Uganda shows implants at 20.8% of the method mix among married women, and 8.7 % among unmarried sexually active women. With increased capacity of providers in insertion of implants, emerging data has shown   a deficit of provider skills for implant removals. As a result, women were being referred to far off higher centers and this posed a barrier for many women. A rapid assessment to get a deeper understanding of implant removal services revealed that of all the 20 LARC providers who had undergone implant training at the 8 facilities assessed, 50% of them noted that they did not get the opportunity to practice removal skills during their training as they were no clients, 15% had inserted an implant but had never removed one and 60 % of providers assessed had witnessed or managed an instance where a client had come for removal but was turned away. All of this was amounting to lack of competency in Implant removals</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In light of this context, Jhpiego designed a package of interventions that focused on the use of low dose high frequency (LDHF) training approach coupled with supportive supervision for improved provider performance and access to quality implant services including removals. The use of innovative training approaches such as LDHF has been found to be more effective for knowledge and skill retention and overall performance outcomes. The intervention was implemented across six districts of Southwestern Uganda: Kabale, Ntungamo, Rukungiri, Rukiga, Rubanda and Ibanda with encouraging results.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>District trainers were identified and underwent capacity building on techniques of standard Implant removal and management of side effects. These trainers then cascaded the learnings to facility providers in their respective districts using LDHF, a facility-based, on-site training methodology. The trainings were 1 day each separated by a week, followed by simulation on the models to ensure skills are honed before practicing on clients under the guidance and feedback from the trainer. Use of mobile outreach visits enabled the learners to gain hands on experience to achieve the desired competency and confidence for implant removal services. In order to create an enabling environment, the project provided job aids and necessary equipment and supplies to initiate and ensure continuous provision of services. Supportive supervision was done jointly with the district trainers and district health officials to address areas for improvement or gaps in service provision and for continued provision of quality services.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The use of the LDHF training methodology has resulted in building the capacity and competency of 19 district trainers in providing quality Implant services including removals. These in turn cascaded the trainings to build the capacity and competency of 104 facility based providers, 81% being midwives across 63 health facilities. Facility providers were assessed in knowledge on side effects management, which increased from 11% pretest to 77% posttest. Similarly, for competency, there was an increase from 15% to 97% of providers achieving competency in implant removal skills, nine months post hands on training. The intervention has translated into increased numbers of providers with competent skills for implant removals. From November 2016 to April 2018, 2,295 implants have been successfully removed either on completion of the duration of the Implant or other reasons as stated by the woman.  Importantly, 46% of women were initiated on a family planning method post removal of an implant, and 57% of those took up another implant.</p><p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>There is a need to deviate from traditional training approaches to evidence based best practices for more effective trainings and better health outcomes. The training techniques and methodology focused on more practice on models in simulated settings and supervised clinical practice and less on theory or heavy content that is difficult to retain. In order to achieve and retain competency of providers, the approach is coupled with supportive supervision by district trainers who support the learner till the desired level of competency is achieved and the learner can be certified to perform the skill independently and with confidence. In addition, having the necessary equipment &amp; supplies at facilities is critical for provision of quality implants removal services.</p>",

In 2016, the South African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS) indicated that contraceptive prevalence among sexually active women was 64.2%, a figure that has remained relatively unchanged since the first SADHS in 1998. Teenage pregnancy in SA is high with the same survey reporting that 15.6 % of women 15-19 years old had begun childbearing (had given birth or were currently pregnant),  with KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province one of the highest at 19.4%. In early 2014 the SA government introduced Implanon NXT, a long-acting subdermal contraceptive implant, with the aim of expanding the contraceptive method mix, and availability of long-acting reversible methods (LARCs) in the public health sector, in an effort to address teenage and unintended pregnancy more broadly.  Current national implant use was reported in the most recent survey of 2016 as 4.7%, overtaking use of other methods such as IUD, sterilisation and in some provinces the oral contraceptive pill. In KZN implant use was 5.8%. However, the two progestogen hormonal injections DMPA  and NET-EN were still the most popular methods used in 2016 nationally (17% and 9.1% respectively).</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p><strong>P</strong><strong>rogramme Intervention/activity tested</strong>:  In SA, there has been growing concern about the waning demand for the implant and the number of women returning for early removals, some within a few months after insertion. We aimed to investigate the changes in patterns of implant use and removals in a more detailed analysis of national data.</p><p></p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> We reviewed published data on insertion of the implant from the national District Health Information System (DHIS) with in-depth analysis  for insertions and removals in one province – KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Descriptive analysis is presented.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Over 175 thousand insertions were recorded in the DHIS in the year 2014/15 reporting year. However, only four of nine provinces contributed data to this total and so it is an under-representation of the true number of implant insertions nationally in that year. In the 2015/16 reporting year all provinces reported implant insertions. In three of the four provinces reporting from start of introduction, insertions rose rapidly in the first few months of introduction reaching a peak at approximately 6 months post introduction, declining rapidly thereafter in all provinces down to levels similar to those at the start of introduction. The overall picture indicated a 50% drop in insertions between 2014/15 and 2015/16 despite all provinces reporting. This pattern was seen clearly in KZN which recorded the second highest number of implants in the first year of introduction however fell to less than 25% of its peak insertion total in 2016.</p><p>At a more local level there are 52 districts in SA with  many districts reporting less than 20 implant insertions  in some months in 2015/16, and there were wide variations between districts, with one district of the total 52 districts in SA  reporting  13% of the national total for the whole year, while others were contributing less than 1%.</p><p>Implant removals are documented for KZN province from start of implementation. Early removals  were calculated as  approximately 5% at one year.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>There may be many reasons behind the change in implant uptake over time. This may be attributed to the pool of women interested in this method being saturated by 2015/16, and that insertions will continue to stabilize at the lower distribution levels. There is limited  data on reasons why the uptake of this method has dropped or the reasons for early removals - an area that is currently being investigated. However, internationally the most common reasons relate to side-effects and inadequate counselling. Although there have been reports of high levels of early removals  In SA, the number of actual removals appears to be lower compared to  data available from other countries.. The establishment of formal monitoring systems for the implant lagged behind the roll-out of the method, posing challenges for determining the true extent of removals. This requires more refined data collection and careful observation and evaluation over time.</p>",

      "title": "What goes in must come out: A mixed-method study of access to contraceptive implant removal services in Ghana",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Since 2013, more than 30 million contraceptive implants have been purchased for use in low-income countries (LICs).  While millions of implants are being inserted, whether and to what extent providers and institutions are prepared to handle the inevitable increased need for removal services is less clear.  Ensuring high-quality and timely access to implant removal is key for the long-term success of implant programs and compliance with informed choice in contraceptive adoption.  Past experience with Norplant in the United States, as well as in LICs, has shown that lack of access to removal services, or even the perception of insufficient access, can damage the reputation of the method and raise concerns about freedom of contraceptive use. Evidence on the current state of implant removal services and potential areas for program strengthening is, therefore, critically needed.</p><p>Ghana was one of the first African countries to roll out implants, and thirty percent of the country’s 1.1 million married contraceptive now use the method.  Approximately 70% of implant acceptors in Ghana use the two-rod implant, Jadelle.</p><p></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aims to assess removal service access in Ghana among women receiving implants through public sector providers and through Marie Stopes International Ghana (MSIG) supported outreach services.  The study objectives are to:</p>\t<li>Measure implant users’ knowledge of the possibility of early removal and where removal can be accessed;</li>\t<li>Estimate the proportion of women ever wanting a removal who were able to get their implant removed at first attempt;</li>\t<li>Evaluate reasons for seeking early removal; and</li>\t<li>Document barriers to removal.</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>This cross-sectional, mixed-methods study includes a phone survey of implant acceptors who received an implant between 2015-2016 from public-sector clinics where services are provided by either public-sector providers or MSIG outreach staff. It also includes in-depth interviews (IDIs) with a subset of implant acceptors and with family planning providers in both service delivery contexts, and an exit survey with women obtaining removal services from MSIG mobile outreach teams.  Data collection occurred between October 2017 and January 2018.  A stratified random sample of implant acceptors who obtained their implant from public sector clinics (Ghana Health Service (GHS)) in Ashanti and Eastern regions and MSIG outreach sites in Central and Western regions were recruited from electronic client databases including the Population Council-supported rsLog in GHS facilities and the MSIG CLIC database.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Only preliminary data from the Ghana phone survey are available at time of abstract submission. Additional data from MSIG client exit surveys and qualitative interviews with implant users and providers will be available by time of presentation. </p><p></p><p>We conducted phone interviews with 1,163 and 1,096 women who received an implant from a GHS facility and MSIG outreach, respectively. The majority had their implant <p>Among GHS clients, 31% (357 women) reported ever wanting their implant removed and, among those, 83% obtained removal on their first or subsequent attempt (median 1 attempt, range 1-8).  Among MSIG clients, 21% (232 women) reported ever wanting removal and, among those, 43% obtained removal on first or subsequent attempt (median 1 attempt, range 1-12). The remaining MSIG clients either had tried but not yet succeeded (15%) or did not attempt removal (43%).  Just over 10% of GHS and MSIG clients who attempted removal reported the provider refused to remove. Among women wanting removal, 64% and 74% of GHS and MSIG clients, respectively, reported unwanted side effects as the main reason for desiring early removal. </p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study provides evidence on the extent to which implant users in Ghana have access to removal services when they want them.  Similar data are lacking in most settings, however are crucial for ensuring full informed choice in contraceptive use.  The study results will be important for identifying any areas of weakness in the service delivery channels for implants in the two countries.  As many countries are in similar states of implant scale-up, the lessons from this study may be relevant in other settings, as well.  </p><p>In our sample, many women who had used an implant for less than three years said they wanted to have it removed due to side effects.  Encouragingly, four fifths of GHS clients desiring removal were able to access services with minimal attempts.  While the study was not designed to compare access across service delivery settings and other reasons may exist for the observed differences, the majority of MSIG clients in Ghana who reported wanting their implant removed either didn’t attempt removal or had not yet succeeded in obtaining removal.  Qualitative data that have not yet been analyzed may shed some light on the reasons why these women have not accessed services.  Similarly, additional data analysis will provide insight into women’s experience accessing removal services, including timing between first wanting a removal and accessing services, where women obtain removal services, i.e., same or different location as insertion, and whether some women face greater barriers to accessing removal than others.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The need for new contraceptive methods to address women’s diverse needs is widely recognized. Fertility apps claim to identify the fertile window of the menstrual cycle and provide women with guidance on when to avoid unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. They may have potential to address unmet need for contraception, providing women with an easily-accessible, low-cost, non-hormonal approach to preventing pregnancy. Availability and use of fertility apps are rapidly accelerating despite limited research validating their efficacy, with more than 1000 currently available online. To understand whether such apps can be used to prevent pregnancy, it is imperative that research following best-practice guidelines be conducted. Few fertility apps appear to be evidence-based, and most are not designed to support formal research studies.  An exception is Dynamic Optimal Timing (Dot), an algorithm-based fertility app. This presentation provides an overview of the Dot app, the efficacy study, and study results in terms of typical- and perfect-use failure rates.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The primary objective of the study is to determine efficacy of the Dot app to prevent pregnancy. To determine the efficacy in both perfect and typical use, Georgetown University’s Institute for Reproductive Health, with the support of USAID, is conducting a prospective efficacy trial of Dot™. The Dot algorithm and study protocol are published in the peer-reviewed literature, and the study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov. Final results will be available in September 2018 and will be shared at the conference.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study launched simultaneously with Dot’s availability on the Android platform and could be downloaded from the Google Play Store beginning in January, 2017. Dot advertisements were placed on Facebook (e.g., video clips on Facebook pages, blogs) with links for downloading. Participants were invited from the pool of Dot users who were preventing pregnancy and had entered their second period start date. Proofmode, an integrated, secure data collection system developed for this study, provided connectivity with participants without interfering with Dot’s functionality or users’ experience.  Proofmode facilitated informed consent; collected data each cycle on pregnancy intention and menstruation start date; collected daily coital history including method used on fertile days (condom, EC, withdrawal); and supported participant engagement. Amplitude®, an app analytics system, tracked user behavior and data entry in real time. These integrated systems allowed pregnancies to be categorized as “perfect use” (no unprotected sex on days Dot identifies as fertile) or “typical use” (unprotected sex on fertile days). Pearl Index and life-table analyses were conducted to determine perfect/typical-use efficacy.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A diverse sample of 718 participants were consented into the study, screened for eligibility (menstrual cycles 20-40 days long, ages 18-39, intending to avoid pregnancy for at least one year, no hormonal contraceptive use in last 3 months, sexually active with a male partner), and enrolled into the study.  Via their phones, participants completed daily coital diaries and periodic surveys.  All participants will complete the study in July 2018, and final efficacy figures will be provided in the conference presentation.  An analysis performed in March 2018 when all participants had completed at least six months in the study found that over 70% of participants were retained in the study, no pregnancies occurred as a result of perfect use of Dot (with perfect use defined as using a barrier method or not having sex during the fertile window), and there were 13 typical-use pregnancies (pregnancies that occurred in cycles in which participants had sex during the fertile window using no method, using withdrawal, or using EC). Thus the interim life-table analysis with 3,024 cycles, indicates a censored typical-use failure rate of 2.63%.</p><p></p><p>In addition to providing final efficacy figures, this presentation will include:</p><ul>\t<li>A demo on how women use Dot,</li>\t<li>An overview of the study design and insight into tools and approaches for conducting rigorous app-based studies and collecting high-quality data,</li>\t<li>A discussion of pregnancy avoidance strategies used by study participants, and</li>\t<li>The potential for including Dot in communication and service delivery.</li></ul><p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Preliminary findings indicate that Dot’s perfect-use failure rate places it in the upper tier of contraceptive methods, while its typical-use failure rate is comparable to or better than those of a number of other contraceptive methods, including FABMs and other user-initiated methods that have been studied with similarly-rigorous research designs. Dot provides consistently-correct information to women about their daily fertility status, enabling them to use Dot as part of a larger strategy to managing their fertile days to avoid pregnancy (e.g., using condoms on fertile days).</p><p>As a non-hormonal, low- (or no-) cost method that can be offered to women independently of traditional health systems, Dot has the potential to be a valid, feasible addition to the contraceptive method mix. Direct-to-user messaging through the Dot app gives women immediate access to critical fertility information and encourages correct, consistent use. A recent study on a similar app (the CycleBeads app) in seven countries in Africa and South Asia showed that women in these settings can and will use a fertility app, that most choose to use it because of its ease of use and lack of side effects, and that the majority are new to family planning.  We expect that Dot will be similarly acceptable and scalable.</p><p>By engaging session attendees in discussion of strategies and best practices for including Dot in programming, this presentation will foster consideration of how to scale up access to the app and support its use by women who choose this approach to pregnancy prevention.</p><p></p>",

      "title": "Hand-held device for removing a one-rod, subdermal contraceptive implant: results of a pilot study and future work",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Subdermal contraceptive implants are increasingly popular in sub-Saharan Africa.  During the period 2013-2017, over 25 million units of product were procured for the region.  Subdermal implants constitute a large proportion of modern contraceptive use: over 40% (Burkina Faso, Senegal, Kenya), 30-39% (DRC, Ethiopia, Ghana), 10-29% (Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Nigeria). </p><p>Concerns have been raised over whether all implant users have timely access to on-demand removal services.  Two inter-related issues are cause for concern: 1) implant removal requires higher skills and more practice than implant insertion and 2) not all clinicians responsible for the high volume of insertions are skilled in removals or even provide the service.  Clinicians use scalpels, forceps, and often tweezers for removal.  The procedure requires bi-manual dexterity, confidence, and patience, among other skills.  In just the sixty-nine FP2020 focus countries, it is estimated that approximately 4.9 to 5.8 million women will need implant removal services in 2018. </p><p>From 2014-2017, a hand-held device (RemovAidTM) was developed to remove a one-rod implant.  The all-in-one device is designed to incise the skin, grasp the subdermal implant, and hold it firmly.  As the clinician retracts the device, the implant is extracted.   </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main question from this study is whether RemovAidTM is safe for use and whether it performs satisfactorily for possible use in a larger comparative trial.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The first human tests with RemovAidTM were conducted at the Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden in 2017.  The prospective, single-centre, non-comparative feasibility investigation was approved by the regional review board at the Karolinska Institutet.  Participants volunteered to participate and agreed to allow digital photographs and video for research purposes and limited dissemination activities.  No formal study size calculations were performed for this research.  To evaluate RemovAidTM, the primary endpoint for the study was the percentage of fixated implants that were successfully removed without the use of additional tools.  Secondary endpoints were duration of the procedure and product functionality as assessed by the clinicians on a 5-point scale (1=very poor to 5=excellent).   Four clinicians were trained to use the product and they conducted 22 removal procedures. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In the first pilot study involving 22 women, RemovAidTM successfully removed 54% of the one-rod implants (n=12).  Four of the failures were due to inability to fixate RemovAidTM over the subdermal implant.  Of the 18 successfully fixated devices, the product was able to remove 67% (n=12).  Of the 12 successful removals, the mean duration of the procedure was 5 minutes and 29 seconds.  Once the incision was made, the mean duration for complete extraction was just under 2 minutes.  The mean functionality score as assessed by the clinicians was 3.3 and the median was 4.  (Note: digital photographs of the product and if feasible, a 45-second video will be shown as part of the ICFP presentation).</p><p>After the first 22 procedures, the removal device was modified slightly.  The slightly modified product (RemovAid02) is currently being evaluated; a total of 19 subjects were recruited in the investigation.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>To our knowledge, this novel product for removing a one-rod subdermal contraceptive implant is the first device to ever reach this stage of development.  Based on the Swedish study, RemovAidTM is safe to proceed to a larger study.  The investigation demonstrated sound proof of concept for device functionality, but it requires some adjustment and optimization prior to using the device for routine removal services.  The trial demonstrated potential to standardize the removal procedure through use of the RemovAidTM medical device. The device may replace other removal tools and may improve access to implant removal services by eliminating complexity.  In the longer term, the device may enable lower-level providers to remove implants, thus expanding access to timely, on-demand removal services.</p><p>More work on this product is continuing.  In Uganda, a study comparing RemovAidTM to the standard implant removal technique is planned (it is feasible that by the time of ICFP, participant recruitment will have started and some preliminary results will be available). </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Hundreds of innovations are being conceptualised, its utility is being tested through various kinds of researches and trials. However, most innovation while very promising during the conceptual stage or during the trial, failed to get the due attention and implementation in general setting or full scale implementation. Most innovation then just become an academic effort and/or activity. When Innovation PPIUD Inserter was selected for further research and study including Safety, Acceptability, Feasibility and Efficacy, Proof of Concept and Randomised Controlled Trial, it was envisaged that the entire study will be done keeping in focus that it should lead to adoption and field implementation. So from beginning, all studies were designed and conducted keeping all requirement of field implementation.</p><p>Addressing the family planning need is a key intervention for improving the overall maternal and child health status. Postpartum family planning is a key strategy to increase the coverage of family planning. However, despite all out efforts, PPFP coverage remains very low in many high priority nations. The major reason given by service provider is that there is no dedicated inserter for PPIUD and it became very difficult to offer PPIUD in a high case load facility with compromised infection prevention practices.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Considering the overall outcome of getting the innovation adopted by both private and public sector, the entire effort of the study and further development ensured the involvement of key stakeholders. Studies were conducted in the government run teaching institutes. Ethical committees’ approval secured, statutory bodies approval taken, various advisory committee formed to oversee the study and further deliberations on the innovations and its usefulness. Professional and its bodies were involved since beginning. The study design was finalized after the various participatory consultations as well as by involving institutes and reputed subject authority in order to give the critical scientific acumen. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study was conducted in India in between July 2013 to July 2016 with both providers and clients with the objective to determine the safety, acceptability vis-a-vis provider satisfaction and consumer comfort and feasibility (does the inserter perform as intended) of the innovation PPIUD inserter, determine client satisfaction and IUD retention. In three studies 425 participants were enrolled. Studies were held in 5 teaching institutes spread across the country. Participants were counselled, consent were taken. Providers were trained using Mama-U model as well on real case. Structured questionnaire was administered to both providers and clients. Clients were followed up at 6-8 weeks to see if IUD is in situ and whether client has any feedback. Data Safety Monitoring Board was constituted for RCT study in order to oversee the entire study externally as well as to see if there is any violation of protocols. Scientific Advisory Committee comprising of Senior government officer, academia’s, professionals, private sector etc, formed at the beginning of study to track the performance of study and post follow ups. Results were disseminated to all including major scientific forum and journals. This allowed the rigorous scientific scrutiny, which helped us to convince the stakeholders for its use.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Study findings demonstrated that the dedicated inserter performed as intended. POC study results indicate that this PPIUD inserter is safe to use with high acceptability among the users and providers. In the vast majority of cases, the IUD was successfully deposited near the uterine fundus, and at a distance equivalent to forceps. Both client and provider satisfaction with the innovation was high in both the Proof of Concept (POC) and Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), with most providers expressing willingness to recommend the inserter to colleagues, and most clients to recommend PPIUDs and the inserter to peers. The biggest advantage of this inserter as described by key government official that it is ‘’Grab and Go” product. Innovation has shown immense satisfaction with provider because it comes in the single sterile package, don’t need any additional instrument like forceps and longer threads making it visible at the os more during the follow ups.  It has the potential to revolutionise the PPIUD coverage. Ministry of Health in India has shown interest to take up the innovation in the public sector if more data emerging from its regular use can be made available. Select medical institutes have started using the device and users are satisfied with its use.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>India has a high unmet need for contraception. There has been a significant increase in institutional deliveries following the introduction of a conditional cash transfer for institutional delivery scheme. However, this is not resulting into increased coverage of PPIUDs. The recently released nationwide survey (NFHS-IV) shows very insignificant improvement in the PPIUD in last ten years. On the close scrutiny, it is found that providers are not comfortable in PPIUD insertion as the current method is very cumbersome. In the resource constraints setting with high case load, it is often not possible to provide the insertion if it is not in a single package. Our Innovation which comes as a single sterile package with dedicated inserter (no need for forceps), longer thread ensuring its visibility in post-partum uterus. All this make the innovation as preferred method of choice wherever it is offered to providers. Above will make sure that innovation PPIUD inserter gets buy-in from all stakeholders.  The most important learning here is that all innovation must have clarity on what solution will it be offering, that it is cost effective and convenient and all stakeholders need to be on boards since beginning of study. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Contraceptive use and unmet need for family planning (FP) in Sub-Saharan Africa is 28% and 24% respectively (United Nations 2015). The Demographic and Health Survey data from 17 countries (1993 and 1996) showed that 50-88% of women would like to avoid pregnancy in the first year postpartum but are not using contraception. In Uganda, the uptake of modern contraceptive methods remains low despite the high fertility rate.  Family planning use among postpartum Ugandan women is 19.5%. This is in comparison with the 30% prevalence among all Ugandan women of reproductive age (UDHS-2011). At the Mulago National Referral Hospital, majority of the HIV positive postpartum women prefer to delay the next pregnancy for at least three years and 65% desire to stop child bearing (Sarah A.G et al). The post-partum period is therefore a critical time to address family planning needs. This is particularly true for HIV positive women because prevention of unwanted pregnancies is an important element in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. However, there is limited data on the predictors of family planning use amongst this category of women.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Aim: To describe the predictors of family planning use among HIV positive women attending an urban HIV clinic with in the first post-partum year.</p><p>Specific objectives:</p>\t<li>To evaluate the prevalence of contraceptive use among HIV positive women with in the first postpartum year</li>\t<li>Describe the predictors of family planning use among HIV positive women in the first post-partum year.</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>Methodology</p><p>This is a cross sectional study that was carried out at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Kampala, where all FP methods are offered to all women free of charge. Data was extracted from an electronic database that is regularly updated. We included all women between the age of 15 and 49 years that were within their first post-partum year as of January 2018 and used any family planning method for any duration of time with in that same period. We collected data on family planning use with in the first post-partum year, marital status, antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, duration on ART, parity and most recent viral load. Descriptive statistics was used to explore baseline characteristics of the study population. Multivariate analysis using logistical regression was used to assess predictors of family planning use.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results</p><p>A total of 174 women were included in the study. The prevalence of FP use was 20% with majority of women using depo provera 17/35 (48.6%) followed by intrauterine devices 11/35 (31.4%), oral contraceptives 3/35 (8.6%) and condoms 3/35 (8.6%). The median(IQR) age was 31(26-35) years; median(IQR) parity 2(1-3); all women were on ART with median(IQR) duration on ART of 54(26-82) months; majority (67%) of the women were married; on first line ART regimen (83.9%) and with a non-detectable [</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Prevalence of post-partum FP use was low. Age, duration on ART, ART regimen and viral load status didn’t predict postpartum FP use. HIV positive single women and those with high parity were less likely to use post-partum family planning. Efforts to increase FP uptake need to be focused on this category of women because they are more likely to have unplanned pregnancies.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Knowledge of contraception is widespread in Nigeria, eighty percent of women and ninety-five percent of men report knowing about a contraceptive method. However, the uptake of modern family planning (FP) methods has remained poor in Nigeria, with only 10% of married women using modern contraceptive methods. The uptake of FP amongst people living with HIV (PLHIV) has remained poor globally, especially in sub Saharan Africa. Meeting the contraceptive and other reproductive health needs of PLHIV through the provision of integrated services is a core component of key global health frameworks. This requires improving PLHIV’s access to FP counseling services and safe pregnancy counseling through the integration of FP services into all HIV programs.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The aim of this study is to ascertain access and factors influencing the uptake of modern family planning methods among women of reproductive age who are living with HIV and enrolled into a care and treatment program in Nigeria.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A retrospective study reviewing patient data from February 2013 to December 2017. The sample population was limited to women of reproductive age living with HIV who were ever enrolled into care and treatment at the Obio Cottage Hospital located in Obio-Akpor Local Government Area in Nigeria within the review period. Data was extracted by the FHI 360 team through a manual count of the documented status of women living with HIV and uptake of FP methods from the patients’ FP cards, the National family planning service register, ART register and Patient Management and monitoring (PMM) tool. The source data was collected from the National FP service register and the Lafiya Management Information System (LAMIS).  Descriptive and bivariate (Chi Square) data analysis was used to examine FP uptake and factors associated with uptake: age, marital status, education, and occupation, with SPSS 24.  Statistical significance was considered at p&lt;0.05.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 700 female PLHIV between the ages of 15 – 49 years had ever started Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) at the facility, with about 70% (494) currently on antiretroviral treatment, 21% (147) loss to follow up, 6% (46) transferred out, 2% (11) were deceased and 1% (2) stopped treatment. The majority (83%) were married and (61%) were within the age group of 30-39 years; 75% reported being employed; and 82% had secondary or post-secondary education. Fifteen percent (110) of the women had ever used FP method, with short acting methods (particularly condoms) constituting 94% of the contraceptives used and long acting methods (implants only) accounting for the remaining 6% of contraceptives used. Among these users, 65% were referred from the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) clinic and 35% from the ART clinic. Ever use of FP methods was highest among 30-39-year-old (74%) and those employed (71%). None of the women who reported having no formal education had ever used a method.  Ever use of a method was also low among women with only a primary education (4%), but was higher among those with secondary (56%) and post-secondary education (40%). Ever use of FP methods among married women (95%) was found to be statistically different (p = 0.001) from those not in union (5%). We did not find a statistically significant association between ever use of FP methods and occupation (p = 0.088), nor was there a significant association between ever use and educational attainment (p=0.701).  </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our findings show that among women 15 – 49 years who had started ART at a facility in Nigeria, uptake of FP was highest amongst married women, those employed, and those with at least secondary education. Condoms were the most used FP methods amongst these women. These findings highlight the need for targeted and innovative FP interventions for HIV positive women with no education and those not in union.</p><p></p>",

      "title": "What are the family planning and safer conception needs of HIV-positive female sex workers in Dar es Salaam? ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Tanzania, female sex workers (FSWs) bear a heavy HIV burden. Among HIV-positive FSWs, abortion and unintended pregnancy are very common, with high unmet need for family planning (FP). Integrated community-based HIV and FP services are an important strategy to increase access to contraception for these women. In addition, however, many HIV-positive women—including FSWs—want to have a/nother child someday. With the advent of effective antiretroviral medications, it is now possible for these women to get pregnant while minimizing risk of transmission to the partner and baby. The global HIV community increasingly recognizes that comprehensive FP services for HIV-positive women entail both contraceptive services as well as “safer conception” counseling, and supporting women to plan whether and when to have children. However, providers receive little guidance on how to broach the topic of planning for pregnancy with HIV-positive women. Furthermore, vulnerable HIV-positive women such as FSWs, often have low awareness of biomedical and other strategies for getting pregnant more safely, such as use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by  the HIV-negative partner, or timed unprotected sex limited to the fertile period.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>To better understand the demand for and supply of this broader conceptualization of FP services for HIV-positive women, we conducted a mixed-method study of community-based integrated HIV/FP services attended by HIV-positive FSWs in Dar es Salaam. Our main questions were: (1) What are the fertility intentions of HIV-positive FSWs, and what is their awareness of and interest in strategies to get pregnant more safely? (2) What are providers’ perspectives about counseling these women on both pregnancy prevention as well as safer conception?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted this study among HIV-positive FSWs and providers at community-based HIV/FP service delivery sites operated by Jhpiego’s Sauti project in Dar es Salaam. Between November 2017 and February 2018, Sauti staff consulted program rosters to identify women to invite to participate in the study. Eligible women were ages 18-49, categorized as an FSW in the roster, diagnosed with HIV &gt;1 month ago, and had received Sauti services in Dar es Salaam in the past year. After Sauti staff identified a list of potential participants, FSW peer educators invited 300 to receive clinical services at Sauti sites, after which a researcher conducted an exit interview covering fertility intentions and safer conception awareness and interest. We also conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 10 nurses and counselors, as well as with a subsample of 15 FSWs who stated in the exit interview that they wished to have a child in </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Median age of participants was 32, and 11% were married/cohabiting. 55% wished to have a/nother child someday, and 29% wanted one within two years. 31% “always” used condoms with clients in the past month, and 51% used a modern method other than condoms (i.e., pill, injectable, implant, intrauterine device, female sterilization). Among those who did not want a child within two years, 29% were neither using condoms consistently, nor using another modern method (i.e., unmet need). When asked to state whether they were aware of various safer conception strategies, 72% knew that antiretroviral treatment (ART) by HIV-positive partners could reduce sexual transmission, and 57% knew that male circumcision could reduce male HIV acquisition. Fewer knew about timed unprotected sex (32%) or PrEP (10%) as safer conception strategies. 80% were “very interested” in learning about safer conception. In qualitative interviews, women expressed greater concern about preventing transmission to babies than to partners. Several had not disclosed their status to prospective fathers. Both women and providers described how HIV-positive FSWs often feel resigned to passing on HIV to their babies, with women often skeptical about ART efficacy to prevent vertical transmission. Providers who discussed safer conception strategies mentioned ART for the woman and timed unprotected sex and ART. The few who knew of PrEP did not counsel women about it, as it was not yet available in the country. Both providers and FSWs emphasized how fear of stigma made it difficult for HIV-positive women to discuss planning for pregnancy with providers.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These findings demonstrate the need for services to address HIV-positive women’s contraceptive needs and fertility intentions, both of which evolve throughout the life course. Most did not wish to get pregnant imminently and had current contraceptive need, but a majority expressed a desire to have a/nother child at some point in the future. It is critical that these women receive nonjudgmental guidance on how they can do so, while minimizing risk of transmitting HIV to their partners or babies. Women expressed notable skepticism about ART efficacy to prevent HIV transmission. These findings underscore the need for targeted training and education for both providers and HIV-positive women, and for providers to proactively and routinely discuss the possibility of having children—whether imminently or at some point in the future. Now that women living with HIV can expect to live well into their reproductive years, HIV providers will increasingly be tasked with broadening the scope of FP counseling to include safer conception strategies, mother-to-child HIV transmission, and HIV status disclosure. Ideally, male partners also should be engaged in these services. Furthermore, the role of stigma as a barrier to care cannot be overstated; there is a need to sensitize providers and reduce stigma toward HIV-positive women who wish to have children. In the Global South, the development of safer conception guidelines and counseling remains nascent, but this study adds to the growing literature documenting the need for—and barriers to—offering these services in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally, there is a large unmet need for family planning in the postpartum period. Sixty-two percent of Rwandan women have unmet family planning needs postpartum. Women spend on average about 30 years, or three-quarters of their reproductive lives, attempting to avoid pregnancy. The World Health Organization recommends at least 24 months between a birth and the next pregnancy. Due to the evidence of reduced maternal mortality upon engagement of postpartum family planning (PPFP), and the absence of robust PPFP programs globally, the WHO distinguishes the postpartum period as the most imperative, yet overlooked, stage in the lives of mothers and babies.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The objective is to compare the cost-effectiveness of postpartum family planning methods (long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) vs. non-LARC: short acting reversible contraception or no contraception) for women of reproductive age (12-49 years) in Rwanda for two years following birth from a health system perspective.</p>",

Future areas of research include the analysis of barriers and facilitators to postpartum family planning uptake.

      "title": "System dynamics modeling of quality care for implant removal services: a cost-benefit analysis of investments in health workforce competence and equipment availability ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Implants have joined the long-acting, reversible contraceptive (LARC) method market and are here to stay. As a safe and effective method, implants are seen to provide a unique product choice among modern methods with rising demand and potential to address persisting unmet need. In Kenya, contraceptive implants have continued to see scale up success in uptake and now account for 18.2% of modern method mix (FP2020 Core Indicators, 2016). However, implant removal service quality and availability have not kept pace with this expansion if implant insertions and 4% of users have reported unsuccessful removal attempts in the past year (PMA2020 Kenya, 2015). Current discontinuation rates are lower than high-income countries with established contraceptive implant services, fewer health facilities provide removals than provide insertions, and mobile outreach campaigns have not always addressed the need for accessible implant removal services. As these implant removal services are not always available upon request and without improvement, client dissatisfaction with the contraceptive implants is likely to increase and have long-term impact on acceptability of the method for future use by the client and client’s network of potential users; in turn, declining acceptability will affect gains for women’s choice among effective contraceptives in the method mix. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>To evaluate the return on investment of programs focused on quality improvement for implant removals, the costs of the investments required to meet demand should be analyzed against the future benefits gained by maintaining and strengthening long-term social acceptability of implants as a LARC method. Implant removal services have many facets that contribute to quality of care and thusly to client satisfaction; two critical components of equipment availability and provider competency in removal care are examined with a system dynamics model evaluating daily demand, costs of inputs and services, and cumulative outcomes of interest in demand fulfilled and long-term benefits. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A system dynamics structure was selected for this model’s design. Utilizing Kenya specific population data, the model evaluates implant removal services across 47 county referral hospitals, with assumptions excluding services requested elsewhere. Modeled from the societal perspective, parameters include training costs, direct costs for services delivered, patient care-seeking behavior, staff competency, and social influence and long-term economic valuation of the health benefits of effective contraception.</p><p>Using many key indicators such as DHIS2 implant service statistics, expected discontinuation rates, and Kenya’s strike data on suppression of service delivery, the model represents one year of service demand. Service delivery data included provider competency, staff transfers and attrition, clinic power outages, level of equipment available, equipment loss, and randomized demand. Cumulative daily national costs and economic value of health benefits are used to analyze the cost-benefit ratio to understand the return on investment in provider competency and removal equipment.</p><p>The system dynamics model calculates outcomes of interest, from the flow of clients to the facility through quality care experiences based on provider competency and equipment availability, as well as the influence of client satisfaction and dissatisfaction back to the population of women of reproductive age and possible users of implants.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The base case scenario has shown that for one year, a total population of women with implants who have a demand of services will be 316,294. Of those women, 160,228 will reach a public health facility and see a provider for implant removal services. With investment in training, 81% of patients receive the quality of care component of provider competency. At current estimates of equipment stocks, equipment is insufficient for demand 38% of the days during 1 year. Demand fulfilled over the year is calculated at 69641 which is slightly increased from the reported removals in 2013 and 2014 (55,771 and 59,320, respectively). Though only meeting 22% of total demand, the total costs of direct services, training, and equipment is calculated at $6,196,147. The long-term benefit measured from an economic value of health benefits gained from acceptability and continued uptake of implants in the population was calculated to save $10,025,366. This shows a cost-benefit ratio of $1:$1.62; for every dollar invested in training and equipment for implant removal services, a return of $1.62 will be gained in the future. </p><p>*Base case scenario represents preliminary findings. Final results will be available/presented at the time of the conference. Results may change due to continued calibration and validation of the model. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This model has several ways in which to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the use of LARCs and reasons to pursue removal services alongside insertion services – even beyond ethical provisions of family planning and protection of women’s choices. The findings presented in this abstract show only the base case, but with modeling, we also have the opportunity to assess ideal mix of investment for improving the competency of providers versus investing in equipment in settings where staff attrition, delays due to power outages, autoclave issues, and loss of equipment are common challenges. The model can also explore some key issues facing those delivering implant removal services. For example, though the strike was disruptive to facility staff and capacity, in the model, this only suppressed services delivered of insertions by 16% and demand for removals by 4%. Another variable to explore is the changes to staff attrition rates over time. </p><p>This model calculates the immediate results of investing in implant removals which can be seen in increases of demand fulfilled and connects this to the important long-term implications of maintaining social acceptability of implants in the modern method mix options. Even beyond Kenya, any government, private sector, or other organization investing in implants or more broadly in the method mix for family planning may use the findings to reevaluate and think critically of investing in a system of care rather than a particular aspect of quality or service provision. </p>",

      "title": "The efficiency gains and impacts of task-sharing: The case of Nigeria",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Nigeria has one of the fastest growing populations in the world.  This rapid growth is, in part, due to low uptake of contraception, estimated at 16% by PMA 2016.  This low rate is further exacerbated by the substantial geographical disparities.  In the 2013 DHS, mCPR in rural areas is only 7% and, in places such as rural North East, only 1.3%.  Unmet need is correspondingly high.</p><p>In the face of such unmet need, at theFP2020 meeting in 2017, Nigeria committed to increasing mCPR to 27% among all women by 2020.  To reach this goal, critical shortages will need to be overcome.  One of the most important shortages is of trained providers, particularly in rural areas where coverage is the lowest.  Community health extension workers (CHEWs) are a potential cadre to which to task-share contraceptive implant provision.  While the benefits of task sharing are becoming more apparent, concerns on the cost of training and scaling such interventions can hinder the ongoing commitment in this area.  Using data on the productivity of CHEWS and the cost of training from Marie Stopes International Organisation Nigeria’s (MSION) task-sharing study of implant provision, we are making the case that task-sharing contributes significantly to efficiency gains.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What are the potential Efficiency Gains associated with the task sharing of contraceptive implant provision in Nigeria?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To estimate the efficiency and benefits of task sharing in Nigeria, we first estimated the average number of implant services that each CHEW delivers in a month.  This information was derived from MSION’s recently completed task-sharing study following public sector CHEWs in the provision of contraceptive implants from January-October 2016.  We then looked at the cost of training and supervising a CHEW until they are fully competent to deliver serviced.  Using government records of the number of CHEWs, we modelled the impact of training 10% eligible CHEWs in providing implants in terms of the number of implants that would be provided to women nationally over a period of 15 years of post-training work.  Looking at population projections and current unmet need, we estimated what impact this resulting increase in service delivery would have in reducing unmet need.  Marie Stopes International’s (MSI) Impact 2 tool was used to estimate the health impact of the services that could be provided by training 10% of eligible CHEWs over that 15-year work-life would deliver in terms of the number of unintended pregnancies averted, maternal deaths averted, unsafe abortions averted, and cost savings to the healthcare system.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>As of January 2018, 2.8 % of CHEWs were trained in LARCs in Nigeria.  Our study showed that, on average, a CHEW provides 8 implants per month.  If 10% of CHEWs are trained by 2020 and deliver their services to those with unmet need, then 14% of unmet need will be met.  Furthermore, as 65% of CHEW implant clients were family planning (FP) adopters, the contribution to mCPR would be even more significant.  An investment of $650 in training costs will enable a CHEW to serve at least 1,500 women (implants only) over 15 years of his/her work-life.  This equates to a training cost of ~$0.40 per woman reached with an implant service.</p><p>If 3,000 CHEWs are trained (to reach 10% of CHEWS trained by 2020) and each provides 1,500 implants, around 4.5 million Nigerian women would be provided with a contraceptive implant.  The total estimated impact of these services would be significant: 4.8 million unintended pregnancies averted; 23,000 maternal deaths averted; and 1.7 million abortions averted.  The potential cost-savings to families and the health care system from antenatal, delivery, and other related care would be at least $175 million.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Task-sharing implants to CHEWs could significantly increase access to long acting reversible contraction (LARC) in Nigeria.  This increase would be particularly strong in under-served areas, where the presence of higher cadres of health providers is sparse, and CHEWs represent ~80% of rural PHC staff, outnumbering nurses by ratio of ~3:1.  Given that CHEW salaries are ~80% those of nurses and midwives, investing in increasing the number of CHEWs trained would be, potentially, a very cost-effective approach to public health.  </p><p>Task-sharing can help increase access to services, improve equity of service provision, and sustain quality of services, while increasing the efficiency of service provision.  Allowing CHEWs to deliver LARCs would potentially free-up time for nurses, midwives, and doctors to concentrate on other health services.  A nurse could have an additional 300 minutes each month to focus on other service delivery needs if implant provision is fully done by CHEWs.  This is a gain in technical efficiency in the range of 5-7%.  Given the scarce resources, it will be important to prioritise the training of CHEWs in LARC provision based on the geographical area/level of unmet need, such as areas in the north east and north west.  With an investment in the next few years towards training currently active CHEWs, as well as new cohorts of CHEWs in school, Nigeria can make significant strides in improving CPR.</p>",

      "title": "What is the price of innovation? Costs and cost-effectiveness of self-administered DMPA-SC (Sayana Press) compared to health worker-administered DMPA-IM in Uganda and Senegal",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Unmet need for contraception remains high in low- and middle-income countries, which has economic consequences for country health systems and for women themselves. Injectables are one of the most commonly used contraceptive methods in many countries, though are associated with high rates of discontinuation. Subcutaneous DMPA (DMPA-SC) is a novel formulation and presentation of the commonly used injectable, intramuscular DMPA (DMPA-IM). DMPA-SC is designed to allow for easier administration by less specialized health workers and for women to self-inject; therefore, DMPA-SC may reduce barriers to contraceptive access and help improve continuation. Recent studies have indicated that self-injection of DMPA-SC is feasible and highly acceptable among women who try it, and that it leads to significantly longer continuation compared to health worker-administered injections. However, the costs and cost-effectiveness of self-injection compared to health worker-administered DMPA-IM have not been evaluated. Information on the economic costs and corresponding benefits of contraceptive options and delivery strategies can help decision-makers, implementers, civil society groups, and advocates make evidence-based decisions about policy and programs.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Given the difference in contraceptive continuation rates between self-injected DMPA-SC and health worker-administered DMPA-IM, we sought to evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of these two methods in Uganda and Senegal. Our study includes both a health system and a societal perspective. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of self-injection, modeled as pregnancies averted and maternal disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, against the costs which include the contraceptive delivery costs, the costs incurred to women, and the costs to train women to self-inject to estimate the cost-effectiveness.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Cross-sectional micro-costing studies were conducted in Uganda and Senegal from 2016 to 2018. Fourteen health facilities in Uganda and 13 facilities in Senegal participated in injectable continuation studies and primary costing data were collected from 10 of these facilities per country. Data on resources used for health worker-administered DMPA-IM or a self-injection research intervention enabled the estimation of direct medical costs (i.e., provider time, supplies, drugs). Costs of self-injection training were estimated based on the research study design and also adjusted for changes in the self-injection intervention design during country scale-up. Direct non-medical costs—client travel and time costs—came from client interviews conducted during the injectable continuation studies. Costs were reported for four injections.</p><p>For the cost-effectiveness analysis, a static decision-tree model with a 12-month time horizon was developed for a hypothetical cohort of 1 million injectable users in Uganda to estimate the incremental costs per pregnancy averted and per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. A similar model is being developed for Senegal. Model inputs were derived from the micro-costing studies, injectable continuation studies, and peer-reviewed literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated from societal and health system perspectives. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of results.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In both countries, total costs were lower for self-injection modeled under current program implementation (Uganda: US$7.83; Senegal: $8.38 per CYP), compared to health worker-administered DMPA-IM (Uganda: $10.12; Senegal: $9.46 per CYP). These total costs reflect the costs when a one-page client instruction sheet is used, rather than the multi-page booklet used in the research studies. Direct medical costs for self-injection were higher than for health worker-administered DMPA-IM because of self-injection training costs. Direct non-medical costs (women’s time and travel costs) were lower for self-injection (Uganda: $1.60; Senegal: $0.97) compared to health worker-administered DMPA-IM (Uganda: $4.66; Senegal: $3.02), given fewer trips to the health facility for self-injectors.</p><p>In Uganda, self-injected DMPA-SC could prevent 10,827 additional unintended pregnancies and 1,620 maternal DALYs per year for this cohort compared to health worker-administered DMPA-IM. From a societal perspective accounting for women’s time and travel costs, self-injection cost less and averted more pregnancies than DMPA-IM. From a health system perspective, simplifying the client training approach can reduce the costs of self-injected DMPA-SC to the point where it is cost-effective. For example, the less expensive training job aid currently used in Uganda would make self-injection cost-effective compared to DMPA-IM, with incremental costs per pregnancy averted of $15 and per maternal DALY averted of $98. Sensitivity analysis showed the estimates were robust.  We also found that using up to two real DMPA-SC units for practice injections during training would still make self-injection cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness analysis for Senegal found similar results as those presented for Uganda.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our costing analyses in Uganda and Senegal are the first studies to assess the costs of DMPA-SC through self-injection, and one of the current few studies on costs of injectable contraceptive service delivery. In addition, our results include women’s travel and opportunity costs, which are often excluded from costing studies; these costs may represent an important factor in women’s decisions about whether to start or continue a contraceptive.</p><p>We also present the first cost-effectiveness study of DMPA-SC self-injection relative to the common delivery method of health worker-administered DMPA-IM. Our results illustrate that self-injection has economic benefits for women through savings in time and travel costs, and self-injection averts additional pregnancies and maternal disability-adjusted life years compared to health worker-administered DMPA-IM.</p><p>Results from the cost-effectiveness study also provide information that is useful for programmatic implementation of self-injection by evaluating the impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates of the materials and time to train women to self-inject. Implementation of self-injected DMPA-SC through routine service delivery has only just begun in FP2020 countries, and training programs will likely be refined over the next few years as more implementation research is conducted. Our results suggest that future self-injection program designs should consider training materials that maintain the cost-effectiveness of the program, while prioritizing women’s competency to independently self-inject.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>UNFPA and UNESCO support Eastern and Southern African countries to scale-up comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) since 2016, the Government of Rwanda has implemented the CSE programme in all primary and secondary schools.</p><p>In Rwanda, youth aged 15-24 (20.4% of the population) have limited access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) information and services. The current Reproductive Health Law requires parental consent for access to modern contraceptives for youth under age 18. Modern contraceptives use of sexually active young women is only 32.8%, and 14% of the women aged 15-49 are married by age 18. In addition, adolescent pregnancy rates increased from 6.3% to 7.3% (2010 to 2015) and childbearing by age 19 slightly increased to 21%. While sexuality issues largely remain a taboo and expectations to abstain from premarital sex are the publically accepted norm, data shows that 1 in 5 women report having sex by age 18, as compared with 12% of men.</p><p>Furthermore, the unknown status of knowledge gaps in topics within sexuality education provides the rationale for this baseline study.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In December 2017, UNFPA and the Rwanda Education Board conducted a nationwide baseline study for the School Based CSE Programme. The primary objective of the baseline study was to determine and document the Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices, and Behavior (KAPB) of adolescents aged 10-19 years in primary and secondary school in topical and thematic areas related to CSE.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study utilized a cross-sectional, mixed methods design. An extensive document review was carried out to gather secondary data and map gaps in available information. The quantitative component of the study used a semi-structured questionnaire, administered to in-school male and female adolescents aged 10-19, enrolled in Primary 4 up to Senior 6. Data collection was preceded by a pilot test of the tools in Kicukiro District. At each selected school, data collectors carried out a Simple Random Sampling of respondents. The study included key informant interviews and Focus Group Discussions, which were matched to the survey questionnaire to allow a triangulated analysis.</p><p>A total of 2432 respondents (1208 boys; 1224 girls) responded to the questionnaire. The study was conducted in 16 randomly selected Districts across the four Provinces and Kigali City. 215 schools were selected, providing the baseline study a confidence level of 95%. The sample is representative for gender at Primary and Secondary School levels.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Youth reported a gendered division of household responsibilities, with gendered attitudes evident as respondents (50.65% girls; 61.42% boys) reported boys being better than girls in science-related lessons.</p><p>Nearly 40% of adolescents reported having been in a romantic relationship at least once: 6.25% girls and 14.77% boys state to have had sexual intercourse, 53.31% of which with a partner their age. On gender based violence (GBV), 55.23% of respondents reported that, sometimes, husbands have grounds for beating their wives. Nearly 3 in 4 girls and 9 in 10 boys reported that girls wearing mini-skirts are the ones attracting rapists.</p><p>1 in 3 girls and 1 in 2 boys reported teachers as main source of learning about sexuality issues, while over 10% did not identify any source. For contraception sources of information for girls are school (56.12%), mothers (13.62%) and radio (10.21%), while for boys, school (54.15%), radio (21.96%) and peers (10.92%). Over 60% of girls and boys never discussed sexuality with their fathers, while 36.27% of girls and 64.14% of boys never discussed sexuality with their mothers. Although respondents reported accurate knowledge of biological functionalities, 17.98% of girls and 24.92% of boys did not know of any changes during puberty. Moreover 28.04% of young people have never heard of contraception, with 90.1% of girls and 72.95% of boys reporting to practice abstinence. 29.5% of respondents indicated they would not share meals with HIV+ persons. 61.36% of girls and 46.94% of boys reported not knowing the signs/symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The findings indicate a heavily gendered understanding and perception of CSE concepts, as observed in the reported division of labour and tolerance to GBV, also highlighting the lack of aspects of positive masculinity in the current programme. School teachers were the most reported sources of sexual learning for youth on several aspects regarding sexuality. Nevertheless, interviews revealed that teachers, while willing, were often uncomfortable or lacked the necessary skills to effectively teach CSE. Overall, gaps in sexuality education knowledge, including on contraception, STIs, HIV, GBV, and other aspects of gender were exposed and call for greater investment to contribute to the CSE programme’s objectives.</p><p>The study furthermore highlighted the importance of data triangulation to validate responses. For example, as it appears that a mobile app was accepted by youth as a trustworthy form of HIV testing, quantitative findings were considered inconclusive. Similarly, as girls are expected not engage in premarital sex, results on the number of girls engaging in premarital sex are not considered reliable.</p><p>Finally, the study allowed for a number of recommendations towards the improvement of the current CSE programme in Rwanda, including the integration of CSE in the country’s key documents, monitoring CSE indicators through national surveys, the adoption of a gender transformative approach and capacity-building of teachers.  The baseline data provides a solid set of evidence in which to monitor and report curriculum and teacher effectiveness in transmitting key information, as well as the state of knowledge, attitudes, practices and behaviours among Rwandan students over time.</p>",

      "title": "Linkage between community and schools to health facilities to improve knowledge on ASRH and family planning utilization among adolescent aged 10-24 years in Nyarugenge and Gicumbi districts, Rwanda.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Rwanda has made substantial progress in increasing access and utilization of reproductive health and family planning services. Although this progress has led to overall improvements in key sexual and reproductive health indicators—including significant decline in unmet need for family planning (from 40% in 1992 to 19% in 2015)—the country continues to face several Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health (ASRH) challenges including the high rates of teen pregnancy, and low levels of contraceptive use among adolescents. By age 19, roughly one in five Rwandan women has experienced at least one pregnancy. Many adolescents in Rwanda are sexually active— roughly, 40 percent of women have had sexual intercourse by age 20. There is limited knowledge about HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention among youth. Only 62 percent of females aged 15 to 19 years and 60 percent of males of the same age have “comprehensive knowledge” of HIV/AIDS.</p><p>Against the above background, Imbuto Foundation tested a new approach, pairing in and out-of-school youth to health facilities to improve ASRH-related knowledge, attitudes and practices, and increase the utilization of youth friendly services in Rwanda.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Since 2010, Imbuto Foundation has been implementing the “Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights” program in two districts: Nyarugenge and Gicumbi, to advocate for the rights of young people aged 10-24 years, regarding access to quality reproductive health information and services in Rwanda. This program features three interrelated components: (1) establishment of youth ASRH clubs to facilitate peer-to-peer learning and communication; (2) pairing of youth clubs with nearby health facilities and training health facility staff on the delivery of youth-friendly  ASRH services; and (3) organizing ASRH forums and outreach events for parents and community members.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In May 2016, using  qualitative research design, 58 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) of 8-10 participants each and 56 In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted at national and district levels as well as in six of the 31 administrative sectors in which the community-level ASRH intervention had been implemented. In each sector, we included sector health center in our sample, and randomly selected one school and one administrative cell (each containing one club), for a total sample size of six health centers, six schools, and six cells.</p><p>For each school and out-of-school club, we conducted two FGDs with club members (one with young women and one with young men).  At each selected school and in each selected cell, we conducted two FGDs with non-club youth (one with young women and one with young men).  In each sector, we conducted two FGDs with parents—one with parents of club members and the other with parents of non-club youth. We conducted IDIs with teacher mentors and presidents of in and out-of-school clubs, health care providers and school staff. Program monitoring data were used to check and enhance the findings. For qualitative data, we used Nvivo software for coding following thematic and contribution analysis approach.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Imbuto established 263 clubs (107 school clubs and 156 out-of-school clubs) in its two intervention districts. On average, ASRH clubs include 30 members. Club members appreciate the intensive ASRH education and dialogue provided by the clubs. Club members participating in FGDs repeatedly expressed their enthusiasm for the education and communication activities of the ASRH clubs.</p><p>Greater awareness of and changes in the provision of ASRH services at health centers have influenced youth perceptions, and use of facility-based SRH services. Knowledge of key ASRH topics and use of facility-based ASRH services, have improved substantially among members of both in and out-of-school youth club.  </p><p>Religious and cultural norms that favor sexual abstinence until marriage are deeply entrenched in Rwanda. However, by acknowledging and validating these beliefs, while promoting safe sex practices, the program helped to temper the view, that contraceptive use is entirely taboo for unmarried adolescents. Clubs have increased understanding of the benefits of family planning for preventing unwanted pregnancy.</p><p>Distance, limited availability of nurses, and traditional beliefs regarding abstinence still deter some non-club members from seeking contraceptive services at health centers. They still have pressing ASRH needs that require greater attention. Parents of club members still find it challenging to discuss ASRH issues with youth. While school staffs want to enable their students to make healthy reproductive choices, and have bought into the awareness-building mission of the ASRH clubs, they still struggle to reconcile program objectives with their largely traditional views on adolescent sexual activity and contraceptive use.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The linkage between schools, community, and health care providers has improved exposure to information and knowledge of ASRH topics among club members, and helped to dismantle harmful myths regarding puberty, sex, and reproduction.</p><p>However, peer education needs to strongly be supplemented with nurse and mentor-led instruction to improve knowledge of ASRH concepts especially at community level. Integrating income-generating activities into ASRH programming can increase participation in out-of-school clubs. It provides them with an opportunity to earn, save, and become more self-sufficient, which acts as a strong incentive for many to join and stay in the ASRH clubs. Given deeply rooted cultural beliefs discouraging premarital sexual activity and contraceptive use, youth greatly value privacy and respectful treatment in ASRH service delivery, they are particularly sensitive to any indications of judgment when they are discussing their needs with service providers.</p><p>Sustained parent outreach is needed to effect meaningful shifts in socio-cultural norms. Parents of club members are deeply concerned about the Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) challenges that youth face and feel a strong sense of responsibility to guard their children against risks of pregnancy, STIs, and sexual abuse or coercion, and to encourage them to make responsible decisions.</p><p>Findings suggest that a significant number of families need to be reached out through Parent Adolescent Communication (PAC) to mobilize parents, gain their support in this process, and sustain the work done in schools and by health care providers.</p>",

      "title": "Parents’ Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) towards Comprehensive Sexuality Education in Secondary Schools in Rwanda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Over the last decade, countries in the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region have taken major strides toward the development and incorporation of Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) in their school curricula. In Rwanda, CSE has been subsumed in the new Competence Based Curriculum as one of the essential cross cutting components. The aim of the school based CSE is to equip children with knowledge, skills and values in an age appropriate and culturally gender sensitive manner so as to enable them to make responsible choices about their sexual and social relationships, explain and clarify feelings, values and attitudes, as well as to promote and sustain risk reducing behavior (Rwanda Education Board, 2015).</p><p>Despite a new curriculum that includes the CSE adopted in March 2015, Rwanda has not officially signed ESA commitment made in 2014 on CSE and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Services for Adolescents and Young People. Furthermore, although the new curriculum was developed and adopted, there could have been more opportunities for meaningful involvement from civil society organizations (CSOs). Thus, HDI sought to contribute to the research on CSE understanding and implementation from a local level.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Studies in Rwanda on sexuality education predominately focus on views of adolescents and teachers in teacher education institutions (UNESCO, 2015; REB, 2017); however parents’ attitudes and perceptions towards CSE in secondary schools are unknown.  Therefore, HDI assessed parents’ knowledge, attitude and practices towards CSE in secondary schools. The objectives were to determine parents’ knowledge and understanding of CSE; seek parents’ opinions on aspects of CSE that were pertinent to their children as well as the appropriate level/age for the onset of sexuality education. The study was likewise conducted to inform HDI and partners in program planning and advocacy on SRH.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In the fall of 2017, a mixed-methods study was implemented in 10 districts and 20 sectors in Rwanda, divided proportionally among urban and rural districts per province. Two enumerators conducted interviews with key informants (n=91). These informants included secondary school teachers and senior education officials (SEOs) in charge of monitoring and supervising CSE implementation. Quantitative data was obtained using a structured questionnaire adapted from Kaiser Family Foundation’s “Sex Education in America: General Public/Parents Survey.” This tool was administered to parents of secondary school children (n=574) from 40 schools (20 private and 20 public) and 91 key informants including teachers. Parents and teachers were purposively selected from 40 schools. Quantitative data was cleaned and coded with SPSS version 16 to perform simple descriptive statistics. Similarly, qualitative data was coded to identify major themes and organize participant responses within such themes.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Knowledge</p><p>Findings revealed that almost half of the parents surveyed (47%) did not have sufficient knowledge about adolescent sexual behavior, with fathers less knowledgeable than mothers. No parents were able to identify any sexuality education related policies; almost two-thirds were not aware whether CSE was taught in schools (64%); and nearly half had a superficial understanding of CSE. There was an increasing lack of parental awareness towards CSE in rural areas (83% aware) compared to urban ones (56% aware).</p><p>Attitudes</p><p>Although 87% parents acknowledged the importance of CSE in schools, 36% of parents felt that it might provoke adolescent sexual activity and the majority (71%) stated they felt uncomfortable to discuss sexuality issues with children. Concerning parent-child discussions about sexuality issues, majority of the parents sampled (77%) reported that they had not discussed sexuality issues with their children at home due to feeling shy, and upholding cultural norms and values.</p><p>Perceptions</p><p>More than half of the parents believed that all teachers should be responsible for imparting information on sexuality to students. Nonetheless, teachers and SEOs believed that only teachers teaching disciplines in which CSE was integrated should bear this responsibility. Both parents and educators were in agreement that the appropriate level to teach CSE is in either upper primary or secondary school.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Encouragingly, the majority of parents recognized that CSE does not serve as a precursor for promoting sexual activity among students. Although the majority of parents surveyed acknowledged that CSE is important for students, almost half had a superficial understanding of CSE content. Parents also raised concerns that they felt could jeopardize the teaching of CSE including: teachers lacking enough time due to heavy workloads; teachers lacking training; lack of sexuality related teaching materials; insufficient clarity on the scope of teaching content; and cultural and religious beliefs. Going forward, it is evident that CSOs have an integral role in promoting positive masculinity as parents predominately responded that it was the role of mothers to have sexuality conversations at home.</p><p>Consequently, HDI recommended that the Ministries of Education and Health, the Rwandan Education Board, and other CSOs should design a comprehensive teaching manual on CSE, develop awareness and sensitization strategies focusing on parents, and better monitor the implementation of CSE across different educational settings and age groups. As a first step to engaging CSOs, HDI held a regional conference in December 2017 that convened high level stakeholders across ESA to discuss best practices and lessons learned regarding the implementation of CSE in their respective countries.</p><p></p>",

      "title": "The contribution of integrated family planning package to improve living conditions of First Time Young Mothers aged 10-19 in Rubavu district, Rwanda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Adolescent pregnancy has negative effects on girls’ education, physical, mental, and socio-economic wellbeing, as it frequently leads to school dropout, discrimination and stigma from families and communities. 95% of births to adolescent mothers occur in developing countries. About one in five young women in developing countries become pregnant before age 18, an equivalent of 7.3 million births every year.</p><p>In Rwanda, the teenage pregnancy rate increased slightly from 6% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2015. One in five girls in Rwanda are First Time Young Mothers (FTYMs) at the age of 19. Only 34.2% of these mothers used contraceptive methods after delivery, as per the baseline assessment. Despite Government efforts, in recent years, to expand Adolescent friendly Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH) services and access to quality services, including use of Family Planning (FP) tailored to young people’s needs, is limited.</p><p>As a response, the FTYMs programme was initiated, providing an integrated package of interventions focusing on psycho-social support counselling including HIV testing, Parent Adolescent Communications (PAC), community based outreach campaigns and income generating activities for effective social re-integration. This paper aims to share the best practices and key lessons learned to influence adolescents and youth programming efforts.   </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>From April 2017, the programme introduced new interventions, targeting the most vulnerable FTYMs aged 10-19 and focusing on improving maternal health, wellbeing and newborn care to prevent other subsequent unintended pregnancies. This is implemented through psycho-social support group counseling, PAC forums sessions to restore the relationship between FTYMs and their parents, community-based outreach campaigns to increase awareness and fight social discrimination, stigma and violence, skills-based training for health care providers aimed at increasing the uptake of contraceptives post-partum and HIV testing, improved child care practices among FTYMs, and the promotion of income generating activities for FYTMs.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The FTYMs programme has been implemented by Imbuto Foundation and funded by UNFPA since April 2017, with the selection of 50 of the most vulnerable FTYMs from two health centers (HCs). In November 2017, the programme was expanded to five more HCs across 7 sectors in Rubavu District, as the pilot phase. 175 FTYMS from 7 HCs benefit directly from the programme to-date. Primary data collection for the programme was done using Monitoring and Evaluation tools over the last 10 months. Nurse focal persons also collected and reported data on monthly basis. Descriptive statistics were used to provide basic programme features, using stata version 14.</p><p>As the FTYMs programme is targeting adolescent mothers and their children, orientation meetings and training of community health workers and nurses were conducted to support FTYMs to accept their status through psycho-social support group counseling, promoting uptake of contraceptives post-partum, including HIV testing, and promoting improved child care practices. PAC sessions and community based outreach campaigns were conducted monthly on preventing discrimination, stigma and violence among FTYMs in their families and communities. The programme also provided cooperative management skills and formed FTYMs-Income Generating Activities (IGAs) groups at HCs.   </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During 10 months of interventions, through psycho-social support group counseling, all 175 FTYMs were equipped with ASRH information compared to the previous period where they had not been exposed to ASRH information and services including contraceptives, and 70% of them chose to use FP methods to prevent another unintended pregnancy. Among those who did use modern contraceptive methods, injectables and implants were the most preferred (31% and 68.3%, respectively). 44 FTYMs who were rejected were allowed to return back home after seven PAC sessions that were introduced to initiate a conversation between enrolled FTYMs and their parents, and six outreach campaigns that were conducted to increase awareness among community members.</p><p>Apart from FP services, the FTYMs gained other SRH services related to HIV testing. All 175 adolescent mothers consented for HIV counseling and testing and; 1.14% of them were found HIV positive and were adhered to care and treatment at HCs.</p><p>Within the same period, the programme interventions trained 175 FTYMs on cooperative management and also formed 7 group-based IGAs, where each group counts 25 members, with each member committing to save at least an average amount of US$0.2 after weekly psycho-social counselling sessions. Overall, 175 FTYMs have saved a total amount of US$7,726 in Umurenge Savings and Credit Cooperatives (Umurenge SACCOs). The median amount of savings in all groups is US$1,146; IQR (interquartile range) [US$950; US$1,187]. From Group-based IGAs interventions, all FTYMs were able to pay health insurance and cover other basic needs for themselves and their children.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Providing an integrated package, including PAC forums, outreach campaigns, psychosocial and economic reintegration, was instrumental in effectively re-integrating FTYMs in their families and communities.</p><p>ASRH, a major challenge among adolescents, requires innovative approaches to ensure adolescents are reached and provided the right information and friendly services early, if they are to make informed decisions and avoid negative outcomes. This also includes removing legal barriers, such as parental consent for adolescent girls below adult age, for them to access ASRH services.</p><p>Counseling sessions and the provision ASRH information are a key influencer in the adoption of FP methods, as the majority of our beneficiaries used FP methods of their choice participating in counseling sessions and receiving the relevant information. PAC sessions and outreach campaigns are also positive factor in address discrimination, stigmatization and violence against FTYMs in families and community.</p><p>The experiences of the pilot programme implementation can be scaled up in the whole District of Rubavu and others Districts using the linkage to existing programmes in the same settings for its sustainability. Clustering with similar identities ensures an easier entry point to targeted populations and address the real needs.</p><p>Partnership and collaboration (in the District) are essential for effective programming to FTYMs in order to address negative outcomes due to social, health, economic and education problems, including malnutrition, poverty and long-term negative developmental outcomes that can be perpetuated if they are not effectively responded to.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally, the number of adolescents and young people is at an all-time high with 1.8 billion adolescents and young people between ages 10 – 24. This young population is growing fastest in poorest and developing nations. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) falls within this context and is among the poorest countries of the world, ranking 178 out of 188 countries in the Human Development Index. It is a young population as 52% are under 15 years old. According to the 2013-14 Demographic and Health Survey, 27% of women aged 15–19 have begun childbearing: 21% are mothers and 6% are currently pregnant. Half of women initiate sexual intercourse by age 16.8; men on average at 17.6 years. Although sexual intercourse is initiated early, modern contraceptive use is low. Only two in ten sexually active unmarried women are using modern contraception, with the male condom being the most popular method. The young population also encounter various challenges when they choose to access sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. Improving their knowledge and practices related SRH is necessary to improve health outcomes. However, little is known about the SRH attitudes and needs among young people in the DRC.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objective of this analysis is to present, compare and contrast the attitudes and perceptions of adolescents and young people in an urban and rural context of the DRC on issues related to marriage, pre-marital sex, pregnancy prevention, and contraceptive use.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This qualitative analysis is based on focus group discussions with adolescents and young people aged 15 – 24 years old from two different studies – one conducted in the capital city, Kinshasa and the other in three health zones participating in the ASSP (<em>Accès au Soins de Santé Primaire</em>) Project. A total of twenty focus group discussions (comprising of 10 to 12 persons per group) were conducted with 224 unmarried adolescents and young people in urban and rural areas of the DRC in 2015. The sessions were conducted in the local language, audiotaped and transcribed into French. Data was analyzed using thematic content analysis to identify the themes in the participants’ discussion of their perceptions and attitudes towards SRH.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Regardless of age differences, common themes emerged. Both in rural and urban areas premarital sex was largely sanctioned by peers but not adults; adolescents feared pregnancy and had limited knowledge of contraceptive methods. Many were misinformed that certain common pharmaceutical products (e.g., decaris) prevent pregnancy. Key barriers to accessing contraception from health facilities and pharmacies included shame and stigma; urban participants also cited cost and judgmental attitudes of health providers. Some themes only emerged in either urban and rural areas because of the topics in the focus group guides for that area. Rural participants perceived contraceptive use as a female’s domain. In the urban area, young people had some knowledge of abortion, but expressed a mix of positive and negative attitude towards it.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The DRC has made significant progress in its SRH programming for young people. Over the course of two years, 2015 to 2017, an additional 100 health zones nationwide received funding for SRH programming for young people. In spite of this progress, our findings suggest that there is a pressing need for information and services for adolescents and young people in urban and rural areas. The widespread acceptance of premarital sex among adolescents and young people, the limited knowledge of contraceptive methods, and misinformation that certain pharmaceutical products prevent pregnancy increases their risk for pregnancy and STIS. The findings also suggest that fear of pregnancy, the judgmental attitude of health providers and fear of side effects are major concerns among adolescents and young people within the urban and rural areas. Addressing the SRH needs of adolescents and young people can have life-long protective benefits. As the DRC continuous to expand its implementation of SRH programming to all health zones, urgent and targeted action is needed to address the persistent challenges and needs of adolescents and young people to promote their use of the SRH services provided.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>La République Démocratique du Congo (RDC), comme plusieurs pays en voie de développement, présente une population jeune avec environ 57% de la population ayant moins de 24 ans et 14,5% ayant un âge entre 10-14 ans. Cette population jeune présente plusieurs défis en termes de santé de la reproduction. Même si l’abstinence demeure la méthode de contraception recommandée pour les jeunes, seules 48% de femmes de 15-19 ans n’avaient jamais eu de rapports sexuels et plus de 27% des adolescentes de 15-19 ans avaient déjà commencé la vie procréative.  A Kinshasa, capitale de la RDC, l’âge médian de premier rapport sexuel est de 17,4 ans, la moitié des jeunes utilisent pour la première fois la contraception à 20,7 ans et ont leur premier enfant à 22,8 ans. Il est important pour les jeunes dès le début de l’adolescence d’avoir des connaissances sur la santé de la reproduction notamment les cycles menstruels car les rapports sexuels restent un facteur déterminant de l’exposition au risque de grossesse, d’autant plus que les données récentes montrent que les jeunes non mariés mais sexuellement actifs sont moins susceptibles d’utiliser les méthodes contraceptives efficaces et d’acquérir les méthodes à partir des structures de santé publique </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Cette étude répond à la question de recherche suivante : Quelles sont les expériences de filles très jeunes adolescents en rapport avec les règles et l’hygiène menstruelle ?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Cette étude est issue des données de base de la Global Early Adolescent Study (GEAS)/passages. Cette dernière est une étude quasi-expérimentale, qui cherche à améliorer les capacités de jeunes adolescentes en termes de santé de la reproduction notamment en adressant les normes de genre. L’étude de base a porté sur 2842 adolescents de 10-14 ans, vivant dans les ménages dans les quartiers défavorisés de deux communes de Kinshasa, sélectionnés suivant un échantillonnage à plusieurs degrés. Les données ont été collectées par interview en utilisant les instruments validées trans-culturellement développés dans le cadre de GEAS. Les données en rapport avec les connaissances, les sentiments, l’expérience et la gestion de cycles menstruels ont été résumés sous forme de proportion et comparées pour les deux bras de l’étude (contrôle, intervention) et les deux groupes (scolarisés et non-scolarisés) en utilisant le test chi-carré ou dans le cas échéance, le test de Fisher.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Comparant les filles scolarisées dans les deux bras, 28% des écolières avaient déjà eu leurs règles, la moitié ayant commencé entre 11-12 ans et l’autre entre 13-14 ans. Les filles scolarisées avaient un niveau de connaissances et des sources d'information limitées sur le cycle menstruel, un tiers seulement indiquant que les règles pouvaient venir de manière irrégulière, 42% sachant où trouver des informations sur le cycle menstruel et seulement 3% ayant une compréhension de la physiologie des sécrétions vaginales. Alors que la grande majorité des adolescentes associait les règles à l’idée d’être femme, exprimait une fierté par rapport au fait d’avoir des règles et indiquait que les règles ne les troublaient pas, une majorité estimait également qu'il était important de garder le secret et 40% avaient honte de leur corps pendant les règles. Plus de 9 filles sur 10 avaient parlé à quelqu'un de la façon de se prendre en charge pendant les règles et plus de 9 filles sur 10 avaient utilisé des produits propres lors de leurs dernières règles. Enfin, 17% des filles ayant déjà eu des règles indiquaient avoir manqué l'école la dernière fois qu'elles ont eu leurs règles. Les non-scolarisées étaient moins nombreuses à avoir eu leurs règles et l'âge aux premières règles était plus tardif que chez les scolarisées. Les non scolarisées avaient un niveau de connaissance sur le cycle menstruel moins élevé que les scolarisées et les non-scolarisées déclaraient plus souvent avoir honte quand elles avaient leurs règles que leurs camarades scolarisés.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Ces résultats montrent que les filles très jeunes adolescentes dans les quartiers défavorisés de Kinshasa avaient des connaissances insuffisantes concernant les règles et l’hygiène menstruelle. Ces résultats suggèrent que des efforts doivent être mis en place pour permettre aux très jeunes adolescents d’acquérir des connaissances suffisantes de leur physiologie reproductive, éléments essentiels pour leur permettre de repousser le plus loin possible les premiers rapports sexuels et créer un environnement propice à l’utilisation future de méthodes contraceptives. Ces résultats suggèrent également que les interventions visant les très jeunes adolescentes ne doivent pas être évaluées en termes d’utilisation de contraceptifs modernes ou des méthodes contraceptives modernes au moment où la méthode contraceptive recommandée pour elles de manière traditionnelle est l’abstinence.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Au Bénin, 600 000 enfants sont impliqués dans le travail des enfants dont une grande partie  de filles sont revendeuses ambulantes au marché Dantokpa laissant pour laplupart leurs parents aux villages ou dans les bidonvilles. Elles sont à Cotonou pour chercher de l'argent. Ces jeunes filles ignorent totalemnt leurs droits et vivent dans un environnement à risque n'ayant pas accès à l’information ni aux services de qualité pouvant leur permettre d'être plus autonomes.  </p><p>Les conditions de ces filles vendeuses deviennent encore plus difficiles la nuit. Elles dorment à la belle étoile sans protection contre les intemperies, les maladies et les violences et abus auxquelles elles sont exposées.</p><p>Les tuteurs de ces filles, les autorités locales et les leaders ne semblent pas s'interresser aux conditions de vie difficile de ces filles et dans un contexte où ces filles sont laissées à elles même. Ces différents acteurs pourtant influents dans l'environnement des jeunes filles ignorent également que les enfants ont des droits et doivent être protégés. C'est donc surtout l'inaction de ces différentes personnes qui favorisent tous les problèmes auxquels les jeunes filles sont exposées.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>L’Association Béninoise pour la promotion de la Famille (ABPF) a mené des actions de recrutement d'une centaine d'activistes au sein de l'environnement du marché pour la défense des droits des jeunes filles.  Dans ce cadre, plusieurs campagnes de mobilisation sociale des jeunes filles vendeuses du marché de Dantokpa ont été organisés de concert avec les activistes que sont les autorités locales, les patronnes des filles vendeuses, les gardiens du marché...etc. Ces actions ont permis dans un premier temps de renforcer les capacités des activistes. Ensuite de faire d'accroitre l'accès des jeunes filles à l'Education sexuelle complete et aux services de santé sexuelle et reproductive.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Dans un premier temps plusieurs sessions d'orientation ont été menées à l'endroit des activistes de l'ABPF du marché Dantokpa en janvier 2017. Ces activistes ont ensuite rassemblé plus de 1500 filles du marché dans la période de Mars à Novembre 2017. Ces filles vendeuses ambulantes ont suivi des sessions d'Education sexuelle et bénéficiés des services de dévistage VIH, de contraception, dépistage de cancer de col et d'autres services SSR. Nous avons également utilisés l'approche de la paire éducation au sein de ses filles vendeuses en les amenant à concevoir des poêmes en langues locales pour sensibiliser leurs pairs. Par ailleurs, les meilleures jeunes filles poêtes ont été primées avec des matériels de travail conformément à leur métier initial. </p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Le résultat principal pour l'ABPF est de réussir à atteindre avec une approche inovante et durable, un groupe marginalisé et défavorisé. Plus de 1500 jeunes filles ont été touchées. Cependant on peut noter les résultats ci-après (1) Plus de 100 activistes (adultes) sont engagés pour la défense des droits des jeunes filles au sein de ce grand marché (2)Plus de 800 jeunes ont suivi toutes les composantes de l'Education sexuelle complete (3) Elles étaient également 648 jeunes filles a avoir fait leur test de VIH accompagné des conseils de réduction de risques (4) Plus de 200 jeunes filles ont également chosi librement une méthode contraceptive (5)Plusieurs jeunes renvendeuses sont des pairs éducatrices au sein du marché (6) Les jeunes filles ont également été appuyés en matériels de travail comme par exemple les machines à coudre pour celles qui avaient appris la couture avant de venir dans le marché. Ces soutiens ont permis d'enlever certaines de ces filles de la rue du marché permettant ainsi de les autonomiser. </p>",

      "title": "Family Planning During and After the Ebola Crisis: Evidence from Liberia and Sierra Leone",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The West African Ebola outbreak of 2013-2016 caused over 11,000 deaths and devastated the already fragile health systems of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. During the crisis, staffing shortages, quarantines, interruptions to supply chain, health facility closures and fear of health facilities and workers resulted in significant disruptions to the provision and utilization of a range of health services, including inpatient health services and surgery,  malaria treatment, vaccinations, obstetric care, and family planning. The UN released a Gender Alert in February 2015 noting that reduced access to contraceptives as a result of the Ebola crisis would put women at an increased risk of unintended pregnancy. A study of the impact of Ebola on reproductive health care in one district in Guinea found a 50% decline in family planning visits during the height of the crisis. Prior to the crisis, Liberia and Sierra Leone had seen gains in expanding contraceptive prevalence while Guinea’s prevalence remained low and relatively constant. Understanding the impact of the crisis on family planning provision is essential for future efforts to expand access to contraception in these countries. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Complex emergencies, like the West African Ebola crisis, can devastate a health system long after the immediate crisis ends.  Our research sets out to answer two questions:</p>\t<li>How much did family planning provision decrease during the Ebola crisis?</li>\t<li>Did the Ebola crisis have a lasting negative impact on family planning provision?</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>We examine monthly provision of family planning services from 6 months before the first Ebola case in each country to 24 months after the last case of the main outbreak.  Weekly numbers of new confirmed Ebola cases over the time frame are taken from the World Health Organization and are disaggregated to the first subnational administrative regions.  Sierra Leone and Liberia collect electronic, routine data (henceforth referred to as service statistics) on family planning monthly.  These data were aggregated to the first subnational administrative region and provided to the authors by the Ministries of Health in each country.  Both countries use the District Health Information System (DHIS2).  Because Guinea’s electronic routine data system (DHIS2) was only implemented in 2015, and there have been challenges incorporating past data from paper records, we are unable to include it in this analysis.  Due to family planning data being available monthly, and Ebola data available weekly, we aggregate Ebola data by month.</p> <p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During the Ebola crisis in Liberia, the lowest level of family planning service provision was August 2014, when only the equivalent of 4054 CYPs were distributed, a 65% reduction compared to the six-month average before the first Ebola case.  Between June and July 2014 (when the number of cases increase from 78 to 193), CYPs declined by 33% month on month, then from July to August experienced another 44% decline, while the number of Ebola cases skyrocketed to 874.  On average, during the whole of the Ebola crisis in Liberia, there was a monthly distribution of 8890 CYPs, a decline of 23% from the six month period prior.</p><p>In Sierra Leone, the level of family planning service provision was seen in December 2014 (November 2014 saw the record number of Ebola cases), when 11602 CYPs were distributed, a 23% decline from the 6 month period prior to the first case of Ebola.  Over the 16 months of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, on average CYPs were only 5% lower than before the Ebola epidemic (Figure 3).  This average decline is relatively small because family planning service provision returned to pre-Ebola levels by May 2015, 3 months before the last Ebola case was recorded. </p><p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Complex emergencies like the West African Ebola crisis can devastate the health care system, disconnecting people from their communities and regular health care providers and disrupting routine and emergency services. In complex emergencies, women are often especially vulnerable, as was seen during the Ebola crisis, with greater risk of exposure to Ebola resulting from cultural and traditional practices and greater risk of negative health outcomes and unintended pregnancy resulting from reduced access to reproductive and maternal health care5,10. This research investigates the extent to which provision and utilization of family planning services are affected during a complex emergency, the amount of time needed to restore services, and whether long-term effects on service provision persist.  The preliminary results indicate that the family planning health sector can recover (and continue to improve) following a significant disruption, and is a lesson in resilience.</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>Special thanks to the Ministries of Health in Liberia and Sierra Leone for their technical support.  This research is part of the Track20 Project which monitors family planning use in the world’s 69 poorest counties.  Track20 is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Cervical cancer is the fourth most common female cancer worldwide, with 85% of incident cases occurring in low‐resource regions.1 The incidence rate for cervical cancer is 16 per 100,000 in Tonga, where it is the leading cause of cancer among women in Tonga. Whilst evidence‐based global guidelines for early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions are available to support program planning, implementation, and evaluation in Tonga,  cervical cancer screening coverage remains limited. In a disaster / humanitarian setting, the MISP model enhanced coverage of cervical cancer screening in Tonga. The MISP /SRH response activities in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Gita presented therefore was an opportunity to increase screening services as well as expand access to FP. Whilst providing women's access to cervical cancer screening services,  HIV Syphilis Testing was also offered during the crisis response. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Cervical cancer screening services was intergated within the  Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) during the SRHR response following the aftermath of  tropical cyclone Gita in Tonga, 12th February 2018. Cervical cancer services were also integrated into HIV/AIDS programming during the MISP Relief Response. Women accessing screening services were also asked if they would like to voluntary take the HIV and Syphilis test due to their risky lifestyles and vulnerabilities.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Primary data from field response conducted in SRH mobile clinic outreach was used for this paper. As well, a desk review  was conducted to identify programs in MISP in which cervical cancer prevention services have been integrated into family planning and HIV/AIDS service delivery platforms. A search of the grey literature on integrated SRH programs was performed to identify case studies or other materials. Following the desk review, Tonga program reports were reviewed and semi structured telephone interviews were conducted with field teams from ‘Eua, and Tongatapu, staff from key regional organizations (IPPF &amp; UNFPA). </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Integrated service delivery through this program has resulted in increased use of both cervical cancer and family planning services. In Tonga, following the introduction of cervical cancer screening and preventive treatment—into a program with a range of contraceptive method options—uptake for both intrauterine devices (IUDs) and Depo among clients attending static clinics increased three‐fold, suggesting a synergistic effect of offering multiple services. Among clients who participated in exit interviews, 77% reported having received additional services during their visit for cervical cancer screening; most commonly cited were clients receiving family planning counselling (unpublished program data). Dual service uptake was most common among women who chose IUDs, of whom 73% were screened for cervical cancer (unpublished program data). </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Key lessons learnt: These data highlight the benefit of integrated SRH service offerings, which ensure that women access services to meet all of their individual needs.Improved targeting for high‐risk populations. Efficient and cost‐effective use of resources and infrastructure. Increased access and uptake of SRH services. Increased knowledge and improved skills of formal and informal service providers. Strengthening an enabling environment for integrated service delivery</p>",

      "title": "Pregnancy Prevention in Crisis: Lessons from Women and Health Workers in Sierra Leone's Ebola Outbreak",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Infectious disease outbreaks in human populations are on the rise. People in low-income countries are especially vulnerable due to underlying health conditions and a lack of appropriate and accessible health services.  When nosocomial transmission is common, e.g. for hemorrhagic fevers, health facilities may cease to function normally, as health workers refuse to care for potentially infectious patients, and service-users fear contamination at the health clinic. Reproductive health services are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions, as family planning (FP) services and skilled attendant delivery are usually provided at facilities. This results in an increase in unplanned pregnancy and maternal mortality.  </p><p>During the widespread Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2013-2016, many health facilities were closed or refused care to pregnant women. However FP services to prevent pregnancy were not prioritized by the Ebola response architecture, nor were existing services maintained sufficiently to ensure access for all women who desired to prevent pregnancy. Previous research in Sierra Leone has estimated that this lack of prioritization led to 549-714 additional non-Ebola maternal deaths due to decreased care seeking behaviour, up to 44% of which could have been avoided had FP services remained in place.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Aim: To understand FP policy and service responses in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak in order to inform how future outbreak responses could maintain FP access &amp; utilization.</p><p>Our research questions are:</p><p>How was FP provided and accessed in Sierra Leone’s Ebola outbreak?</p><p>How could FP services be made more resilient in future outbreaks? </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This retrospective research took place in Kambia and Western Area districts of Sierra Leone, between November 2017 and September 2018.  We used an ethnographic approach to identify and gain trust of women who had, and had not, accessed FP services during the outbreak.</p><p>We used primary and secondary data sources. Primary data collection comprised in-depth interviews with: (i) 19 women to assess influences on access to FP services and use of contraception; and (ii) 7 FP service providers and 9 policy decision-makers to understand the supply side challenges of providing FP care in the outbreak. We also conducted focus group discussions with service users and service providers to identify policy recommendations to promote greater resiliency of FP services in future outbreaks of infectious disease. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>At the time of abstract submission, we had completed eight in-depth interviews; full data, analysis and recommendations will be presented at the conference. Preliminary analysis indicates that some women who were already using FP at the time of the outbreak were determined to stay on that method and were able to access services. Their strong motivations were driven by amplified fears of pregnancy in the face of challenges in finding safe delivery locations, and by other desires to delay pregnancy, e.g., in order to return to studies when school restarted. Health care providers reported how, even though they were afraid of becoming infected, they continued to provide all FP methods (including invasive ones that posed a risk of body fluid exposure) to women. They did this because they understood how important FP was, especially given the risks of pregnancy during Ebola.</p><p></p><p>While women reported that <i></i>FP became more difficult to access during Ebola, strong desires to prevent pregnancy motivated women to find a way to access it, including through pharmacists, or by asking health workers to provide the service outside of the clinic. Seeking care outside of formal clinics was favoured due to infection risk concerns in clinics.  Health workers were not considered to be a source of infection, as long as they were wearing gloves or other forms of protective equipment.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>There are currently very limited evidence-based programming strategies on the management of FP services during infectious disease outbreaks. Our research aims to address this gap by providing contextualized, practical recommendations that could be used in both Sierra Leonean and Global guidelines for resilient FP services in such contexts.</p><p>Our early findings suggest that policies and guidelines for FP in outbreaks should include provisions for FP delivery using non-conventional means.  This could include mechanisms to allow pharmacists or health workers to access commodities and provide them outside of the normal clinic environment.  Another approach might to provide women seeking FP who are reluctant to visit health facilities or health workers with self-medication options (e.g., self-injecting contraceptives such as Sayana Press).  Humanitarian agencies responding to outbreaks could stock such methods and ensure they are distributed to populations at greatest risk, including individuals who have been quarantined and adolescents.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p><strong>Background:</strong> Prevention of unintended pregnancy is a primary strategy to reduce adverse Zika-related pregnancy and birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other severe birth defects. The threat of adverse reproductive outcomes associated with the Zika virus intensifies the need for access to contraception among women who choose to delay or avoid pregnancy during a Zika outbreak.. During the 2016-2017 Zika virus outbreak, Puerto Rico had the highest number of Zika virus infections in the United States. Puerto Rico also had a high proportion of unintended pregnancies and limited access to contraception, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p><strong>Program intervention:</strong> To address these barriers, the Zika Contraception Access Network (Z-CAN) was established as a short-term emergency response for rapid implementation of reversible contraceptive services. The objective of Z-CAN was to build a network of health care providers offering client-centered contraceptive counseling and the full range of reversible contraception at no cost to women in Puerto Rico who chose to prevent pregnancy during the Zika virus outbreak. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Methodology: </strong>Z-CAN was developed by establishing partnerships, securing private donations for a supply of reversible contraception, building capacity in contraception service provision among providers, and collecting programmatic data to monitor progress. The Z-CAN program was rapidly designed and scaled-up from May – November 2016 and continued to provide contraception services to women in Puerto Rico through September 2017.  Baseline characteristics of the provider network and the over 28,000 participants served by the Z-CAN program across Puerto Rico are described.</p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> 177 physicians participated in one of eight Z-CAN trainings. Of those, 153 (141 obstetrician gynecologists and 12 family physicians or pediatricians) participated in Z-CAN. Ninety-six percent of women seeking Z-CAN services received same-day provision of a reversible contraceptive method. While only 4% of women used a LARC method prior to Z-CAN, 70% chose and received a LARC method at their initial visit. Among women who received a LARC method, 75.7% used no method or a least effective method (i.e., condoms or withdrawal) prior to their Z-CAN visit. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p><strong>Program implications:</strong> Z-CAN was designed as a short-term response for rapid implementation of reversible contraceptive services in a complex emergency setting in Puerto Rico and has served over 28,000 women.  Z-CAN strategies and lessons learned can be replicated or adapted in other emergency preparedness and response efforts that pose a risk to pregnant women and their infants or in non-emergency settings in which the goal is to increase access to contraception and improve health outcomes.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>This analysis shows the value of service statistics data in understanding the patterns of implants use at the county level that will contribute to the development of county specific interventions to promote increased uptake of Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) methods including implants. Since the 1990s when the implants program began in Kenya, there has been focused strategies by the government and development partners to promote access and uptake of implants in the country. The investments were followed by significant expansion in method mix, from short-term methods to greater use of LARC, with the uptake for implants increasing from 5% in 2008-09 to 18 % of the method mix in 2014 (Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys).  The Government of Kenya is interested in understanding how implant use has changed over time and if trends from service statistics provide reliable signals on implant use at the county level in the years post-DHS surveys.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>From the Kenya Demographic and Health surveys, between 1993 through 2014 by region, classified by their distribution along the “S” curve.  The highest increases in mCPR were seen in Rapid-Growth and Low-Prevalence counties. The highest rates of increases in implant prevalence are also seen in regions with counties with rapid-growth potential in the S- Curve. This analysis seeks to evaluate the reliability and interpretation of the changing trends in implants insertions from DHIS2 post-survey and explain what is expected in terms of patterns of uptake at different levels of mCPR growth.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data from service statistics (visits data) at the county level was compiled and compared based on distribution along the S-Curve using county level modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) estimates from the 2014 KDHS. Counties were split into three groups; high prevalence counties (top of the S-Curve), counties in the rapid growth stage(middle of the S-Curve) and counties with low prevalence/slow growth stage (bottom of the S-Curve ). Patterns among counties at each stage was observed and explained based on general characteristics of growth during the identified S- Curve stage. Two comparisons were made for implant uptake and changes in prevalence from surveys with DHIS2 trends to understand how implant use has changed over time and if trends from service statistics provide reliable signals on implant use in the years post the 2014 KDHS.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>County level mCPR comparisons were done by group for changes in overall prevalence and prevalence of implants between two surveys (KDHS 2008 and 2014).  The results showed that the highest increases in mCPR were seen in Rapid-Growth and Low-Prevalence counties. The highest rates of increases in implant prevalence are seen in regions with counties with rapid-growth potential.</p><p>Since 2015, DHIS2 data shows a declining trend in implants insertions for most of the counties at high mCPR levels. At this high levels of prevalence it appears that counties may have reached saturation with only a few counties continuing to show modest expansion in implants. Substitution of implants for other methods rather than growth in overall use is anticipated. For the counties in the second group : rapid growth potential counties, DHIS2 trend show that implants insertion grew only in a few counties although we had expected growth in most of these counties. The counties that continue to have an increased use implants include: Bungoma, Migori, siaya and Tana River, a more indepth analysis show that these counties have a lot of implementing. In general most county public health services were disrupted for significant part of 2016-2017 which may explain lower than expected increase. For the counties in group three, low growth potential, the results show a mixed pattern in terms of use. Mandera and Garissa maintained a steady upward trend these are counties with the largest increases in mCPR per survey and estimated method use in this group.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The analysis found out that implants trends from DHIS2 are similar to survey trends and can be relied upon post-survey. There is a declining trend post 2015 post for implants insertion at the national level. Declining trends are a feature both high prevalence and rapid growth potential counties. Declining trends in high prevalence counties may be as much a function of saturation of the market, to supply side constraints.</p><p>Additional data from the Health Facility Assessment report showed that Stockouts of Implants and inadequate training of service providers on insertion and removal of implants may have constrain growth in “Rapid-growth” counties. There is need to address declining trends in counties with potential for rapid growth where uptake is slowing or declining.Issues relating to stockouts and availability of trained providers need to  be addressed to support potential for growth.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) uses a standardized approach to collecting high-quality, nationally representative data on health and population in more than fifty developing countries. They are often the best source of information on a country’s contraceptive needs and gaps and are frequently used to monitor a country’s progress in addressing them. They are also a useful but underutilized resource for designing evidence-based family planning (FP) interventions. Secondary analyses of DHS data can facilitate a rapid, in-depth examination of the needs, opportunities and gaps in interventions and provide valuable input to inform country strategies.</p><p>The Sustaining Health Outcomes through the Private Sector (SHOPS) Plus project is USAID’s flagship initiative in private sector health.  SHOPS Plus works to increase utilization of family planning and other health products and services, including through development and implementation of evidence-based strategies. SHOPS Plus’s approach to in-depth secondary analyses of DHS data for developing a country FP strategy is illustrated through analyses and recommendations based on the Afghanistan DHS 2015 (AfDHS 2015).</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In Afghanistan, SHOPS Plus completed a secondary analysis of data from the Afghanistan DHS 2015 to answer the following three program intervention questions:</p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>Should Afghanistan prioritize trial rates or continuation rates to increase modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR)?</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Which segments of the population should FP programs target to achieve the greatest increases in contraceptive use? What are their needs, barriers, and socio-demographic characteristics?</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>What changes to available method mix and product/service delivery strategies are required to increase contraceptive use?</p>\t</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>SHOPS Plus conducted secondary analyses of AfDHS 2015, a nationally representative survey of ever-married women and men ages 15-49 from more than 24,000 households. SHOPS Plus analyzed the women’s and men’s individual recode data files to examine socio-demographic variables, fertility intentions, contraceptive use and intentions, source of FP method obtained, contraceptive discontinuation, reasons for non-use, and media use. SHOPS Plus conducted univariate analyses and cross-tabulations on weighted data. To translate the <em>proportions</em> of ever married men and women obtained from the analyses into <em>numbers</em> of ever married men and women, SHOPS Plus used the median population estimate for 2015 developed by United Nations Population Division (United Nations, 2015). Using these variables, SHOPS Plus segmented ever married women in Afghanistan into four groups: users of modern methods, users of traditional methods, non-users who intend to use a modern contraceptive in the future, and non-users who do not intend to use a modern contraceptive in the future. The project then developed socio-demographic and need profiles of women in each of the segments. SHOPS Plus then compared the need and socio-demographic profile of intending non-users with current users of each modern FP method to draw inferences pertaining to the main research questions.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<ul>\t<li>\t<p>Discontinuation rates are low, other than for fertility-related reasons and most ever-married women have never used a modern contraceptive. This suggests that Afghanistan should focus on increasing use by increasing trial or new users.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Though most women in Afghanistan wish to delay or avoid their next pregnancy, only 17% of ever-married women intend to use a modern contraceptive in the future. Helping these women adopt a modern FP method will nearly double the country’s mCPR. Young intenders (less than 29 years old), gave birth in the previous 6 months and would like to space their next birth. They live in six of Afghanistan’s 37 provinces</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>The profile of intending users is misaligned with the choices available to women and how they perceive the methods:</p>\t<ul>\t\t<li>\t\t<p>Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) are the most commonly used method by young women with a need to space births (the demographic similar to intending users). However, a majority of intending users are exclusively breastfeeding, and COCs are not recommended for these women.</p>\t\t</li>\t\t<li>\t\t<p>DMPA is an appropriate spacing method for lactating women. However, in Afghanistan, DMPA is used mainly by older women who do not want any more children rather than young women who wish to space the next birth. Therefore, DMPA may not be adopted by intending users.</p>\t\t</li>\t\t<li>\t\t<p>The majority of intenders live in rural areas and condoms would suit their needs and life stage. However, condoms are underutilized in rural areas.</p>\t\t</li>\t</ul>\t</li></ul>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>In Afghanistan, SHOPS Plus’s secondary analysis of DHS data led to a set of clear, actionable recommendations for managers of FP programs:</p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>Afghanistan needs to continue prioritizing new users of FP, while maintaining the currently low discontinuation rates</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Programs should focus on facilitating young women - many of whom are exclusively breast feeding their child and wish to space their next birth- to adopt family planning. A majority of these women live in six main provinces of Afghanistan. A shortage or disruption of resources in these provinces could have a disproportionate impact on Afghanistan’s potential gains in mCPR.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>An analysis of women most likely to adopt FP highlights for a need to prioritize the following product/service delivery strategies:</p>\t<ul>\t\t<li>\t\t<p>Post-partum (PP) family planning strategies such as facility based PP intra uterine contraceptive device service provision</p>\t\t</li>\t\t<li>\t\t<p>Expanding access to PPFP methods such as progestin-only pills</p>\t\t</li>\t\t<li>\t\t<p>Repositioning DMPA as a spacing method for young couples, possibly through introduction of Sayana Press</p>\t\t</li>\t\t<li>\t\t<p>Increasing men’s access to FP information and products by re-invigorating male health workers</p>\t\t</li>\t</ul>\t</li></ul>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Contraceptive discontinuation may leave women vulnerable to unintended pregnancies and subsequent unwanted births, potentially resulting in increased risk of maternal and child morbidity and mortality. Side effects have been cited as an important reason for contraceptive discontinuation, causing approximately one in 10 contraceptive users to stop using a method within 12 months of initiation. Definitions of discontinuation vary, but often encompass both women who stop their method and become nonusers and women who switch to a different method. The risks for unplanned pregnancy substantially differ between these types of users and disaggregating those who switch from those who abandon contraception may help to inform strategies that aim to retain current users while also reaching additional users.</p><p>While side effects are common for many contraceptive users, the experience of side effects may affect women and their subsequent use very differently. Connecting women to her provider or clinic at this point may be crucial for determining if they continue using their method, switch to a different method or discontinue all together. Understanding whether behaviors like seeking medical help for side effects are related to status of contraceptive use may help to inform improvements to programs and policies for better reproductive health services.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We compared the likelihood of 1) reporting side effects by clients’ status of contraceptive use at six months: continuing a method, switched to another modern method, or discontinued modern methods. Among those who reported side effects, we also investigated the relationship between 2) seeking medical help for side effects and their status of contraceptive use. We hypothesize that those who switch or discontinue are more likely to report side effects than continuous users. In addition, we expect that those who switch to a different method are more likely to have sought medical care.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A 12-month longitudinal study investigating the relationship between family planning (FP) service quality and contraceptive discontinuation enrolled women of reproductive age (15-49 years) from two social franchise networks: Marie Stopes Society’s Suraj in Pakistan and Population Services International’s ProFam in Uganda. To be eligible, women needed to be first-time users, switchers to a new modern method, or lapsed users returning to use (referred to as user type) and had to receive a reversible commodity based modern method during their FP visit. Clients obtaining a resupply of an existing method were not eligible. Exit interviews were conducted privately with clients who consented immediately following an FP visit at a social franchise site. Side effects information was collected at 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up visits.</p><p>This preliminary analysis includes side effects reported among clients in need of FP through six months follow-up. Clients discontinuing due to reduced need (i.e. desired pregnancy, infrequent sex) were excluded. Logistic regression was used to assess differences in 1) reporting side effects and 2) having sought medical help for side effects across women who continued their method, switched methods and discontinued. Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC) was used to select the model that best fit the data.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 795 women in Pakistan and 1045 women in Uganda were included in this analysis. Less than 20% and 10% switched or discontinued by six months in Pakistan and Uganda, respectively. Clients differed by baseline method with a higher proportion of switchers and discontinuers using short-term hormonal methods and condoms compared to long acting reversible methods (LARC) (p-value<p>In Pakistan, adjusting for baseline method and user type, switchers and discontinuers had a more than 10-fold increase in the odds of reporting side effects versus continuers (OR [95% CI]: 12.96 [7.19-23.36] and 10.11 [5.63-18.17], respectively). In Uganda, side effects were similarly more likely for switchers (2.54 [1.36-4.72]) and discontinuers (2.21 [1.13-4.33]) than continuers, although with a lower magnitude, controlling for baseline method and education.</p><p>Among clients reporting side effects (n=251 in Pakistan and n=567 in Uganda), switchers had a marginally-significant higher likelihood of having sought medical help than continuers in both Pakistan (2.61 [0.97-6.98]) and Uganda (1.97 [0.97-4.46]). In Pakistan, discontinuers were not significantly less likely to seek help (0.88 [0.34-2.32]) versus continuers, adjusting for baseline method, being informed of what to do about side effects and whether side effects interfered with daily routines (i.e. severity). In Uganda, discontinuers were significantly less likely to seek help (0.37 [0.16-0.86]) than continuers, controlling for method, reason for use (spacing versus limiting) and if daily routines were affected.</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Greater use of LARCs among clients of social franchises may contribute to higher than national average contraceptive continuation rates. With LARCs, contraceptive switching or discontinuing are “active” behaviors and require clients to visit a clinic to have the method removed while stopping use of short-term methods is “passive” and requires no added effort.</p><p>Consistent with prior work linking side effects and discontinuation, clients who switched or discontinued were more likely to have reported side effects than those who continued their baseline method. This association was especially strong in Pakistan, suggesting side effects may play a significant role in determining continued use in this setting.</p><p>Our results suggest that regardless of the severity of side effects and baseline method type, method switching was related to seeking medical help for side effects, supporting previous research. Modern method discontinuers were less likely to have sought help for side effects, although this association was not significant in Pakistan. These findings imply that those who switch methods were most compelled to seek medical help to manage their side effects and those who discontinued were the least. Alternatively, with invariance of ORs, users who interface with a provider in seeking medical help with their side effects are more likely to switch methods than those who do not seek help. Ensuring that women understand they can change their method, improving the method mix, and facilitating improved provider/client management of side effects in follow-up care may help to reduce contraceptive discontinuation while in need.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Accurate estimates of family planning (FP) coverage are essential for monitoring progress towards both the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) goals. The modern contraceptive prevalence (mCPR) has been measured through population-based sample surveys. The data quality of mCPR estimates has always been a concern, and multiple factors affect the quality. One that has been studied relatively rarely is if and how women’s reporting of current use of contraception is affected by being asked about awareness of various methods previously during the interview. The awareness questions are used to collect data on method awareness – a crude proxy for knowledge – and to prime respondents for following questions on current use of contraceptive methods. While questions on current use have been harmonized across most surveys, questions on method awareness have been included inconsistently. For example, the awareness questions long have been used in Demographic Health Surveys but not in Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, although both surveys have been key data sources for mCPR estimates over decades. Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) surveys – family planning monitoring surveys launched in 2013 – initially did not include the awareness questions, but included them in subsequent surveys around</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study purpose was to explore the impact of including the method awareness questions on women’s reporting of current method use, using observational data from PMA2020 surveys without and with the awareness questions. Considering a short interval between the two surveys, we assumed the level and pattern of current method use remained stable but hypothesized that women across different background characteristics were affected differentially with the awareness questions in the later survey. Specific aims were to 1) assess differences in reported method use by background characteristics, and 2) compare the differential pattern between surveys without and with the awareness questions.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We analyzed two cross-sectional, population-based surveys – without and with method awareness questions – from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria. These surveys were conducted approximately 6 to 12-months apart between 2014 and 2016. In both surveys, current method use questions were asked of non-pregnant women between the ages of 15-49. In the later survey, method awareness questions were asked of all women immediately before current use questions.</p><p>A key hypothesis of the study is that women’s response for current method use may be affected by the awareness questions in select subgroups of women, for example, those in lower socioeconomic status than their counterparts. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between reported modern method use and background sociodemographic characteristics. A Chow test analysis was performed to explore if the odds ratios of reported current modern method use differed between the without awareness questions (WOAQ) and with awareness questions (WAQ) by various sociodemographic characteristics within each country. Both bivariate and multivariate Chow tests were conducted. Analyses were restricted to all non-pregnant women who were asked about current method use. All analyses were conducted by country and adjusted for sample design. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Across study countries, the majority of women surveyed were between the ages of 15 to 29 and in a union (married or living with a man). Estimates of the contraceptive prevalence rate varied considerably by country/region, ranging from 48.9 percent in Kenya to 14.9 in Kaduna state, Nigeria. Between the two survey rounds, mCPR increased statistically significantly in Kenya (from 42.3% to 48.9%): it increased in other countries/states but without statistical significance. The level of awareness of contraceptive methods varied by country and method type.</p><p>Similarly, sociodemographic factors associated with reported modern method use varied considerably by country/state. The characteristic most consistently associated with reported modern method use was union status. Across all countries, the odds of reporting current method use were almost two times larger for women in union than their counterparts. The Chow test analysis results suggested that, overall, the introduction of method awareness questions did not result in differential patterns in reported modern method use by socioeconomic characteristics in surveys without and with the awareness questions. There was one exception that the odds ratio of reported modern method use by union status were statistically significantly different between the two surveys: differences in odds decreased in the later survey WOAQ in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Kaduna, Nigeria.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These study findings add additional insights to the literature on family planning survey methodology. Specifically, our findings suggest that the inclusion of method awareness questions does not differentially influence women’s reporting of current modern method use by sociodemographic characteristics during these PMA2020 survey rounds, despite limitations of a secondary analysis of observational data. In the absence of much prior research work or literature in this area, it is challenging to make generalization and recommendations based off of this single study whether or not women’s reporting of current method use is independent of exposure to a series of method awareness questions. Subsequent analyses should continue to fill and identify the research gaps to measuring mCPR in LMICs. As we approach post-FP2020 and continue to require high-quality data and valid metrics for measuring progress towards the SDG goals, now is the time to develop evidence-based research methodologies to ensure accurate estimates of FP coverage for women and couples globally, as well as within specific contexts and populations. </p>",

In addition, 24.3% of women aged 15 to 19 become pregnant in Migori County,which is higher than the national average of 18.1% (KDHS, 2014).Lwala Community Health Center (LCHC)operates in North Kamagambo, Migori County to address these challenges in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) by increasing awareness, access to, and uptake of quality family planning methods, particularly long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) information and services to women and young people of reproductive age.</p><p></p><p>In early 2015, the SRH team in LCHC experienced a high number of cases in which teenage girls were reporting to its facilities seeking removal of contraceptive implants. The girls were instructed to remove the implants by teachers who noticed them during routine school inspections. Other cases of negative attitudes towards of family planning for young people were exhibited by parents, village elders, chiefs, religious leaders, and some community members leading to low uptake of family planning services. High rates of teenage pregnancies coincided with this trend of opposition to family planning services.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To address the above challenges, the LCHC SRH team developed a SRH Advisory Committee in June 2015,comprising of Community Resource Persons (CORPs) namely: 5 teachers, 5 village elders,3 chiefs,3 religious leaders,5 young people aged 15 to 24 years and 9 community members (including parents). LCHC team envisioned that once sensitized, the CORPs would make a positive change in the community due to their influential nature largely through sensitization of community members and law enforcing.</p>",

The advisory committee was formed with the objective of sensitizing them on the benefits of family planning and how it can reduce teenage pregnancies in the area. The committee underwent a four-day sensitization forum to demystify the myths and help them understand the benefits of contraception. The SRH Advisory Committee holds monthly meetings where updates and reports are shared and work plans are agreed on. The LCHC team envisioned that once sensitized, the CORPs would make a positive change in the community due to their influential nature largely through sensitization of community members and law enforcing.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>As a result of this intervention, the team observed changes in attitudes on family planning. Teachers no longer check students for contraceptive implants and instruct them to seek removal; instead, they provide the LCHC team with an opportunity to hold health education sessions in schools. Village chiefs talk positively about contraceptives in public meetings and social gatherings, while encouraging community members to utilize family planning methods. These chiefs cite economic insecurity due to large family size as one of the dangers of unplanned pregnancies. There is increased support and advocacy from religious leaders, parents and the community on young peoples' right to access family planning and other sexual reproductive health services, including HIV testing services and STI screening and treatment services among others.</p><p>Following the intervention,6 defilement and 1 rape cases have been reported to-date, resulting in 4convictions and 2 pending court decisions.

      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Using CORPs in a structured manner is key in addressing sensitive issues SRH such as family planning uptake by young people, especially in a rural African context. Sensitizing teachers is pivotal in accessing schools and engaging additional educators, as well as providing to young people with accurate SRH information. Changing attitudes of religious leaders is critical as an entry point in religious institutions, and parents often determine the health access of their children. Ensuring that these community influencers understand the importance of family planning and are prepared to advocate for its increased uptake amongst young people is of vital importance to improving SRH outcomes.</p><p>LCHC intends to apply this concept of engaging CORPs in other projects in education, economic empowerment, community health and the clinic. CORPs have the ability to address local issues to enhance local ownership and sustainability, but there is a need to develop easy-to-understand guides to help streamline the sensitization, particularly around family planning which should have simplified medical language. In addition, a structured plan to facilitate documentation and tracking of such an intervention should be developed to encourage continuous learning, which LHCH intends to lead the charge on.</p>",

      "title": "Sex, love, &amp; betrayal: Effects of an entertainment-education radio serial drama on fertility awareness and family planning in Rwanda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Mass media approaches using entertainment education have been proven to increase sexual and reproductive health knowledge, attitudes, and social support across a large audience—often national in scope. The Institute for Reproductive Health and Population Media Center collaborated under the USAID-funded FACT Project to create a serial radio drama in Rwanda called <em>Impano n’Impamba (A Gift for Today That Will Last a Long Time). </em>The dynamic 104-episode drama was nationally broadcast semi-weekly from October 2014-2015. The drama uses a proven theory-based approach to behavior change communication developed by Miguel Sabido which relies on role modeling to encourage discussion and self-reflection. <em>Impano n’Impamba</em> takes on racy and controversial issues and confronts taboos like sex among unmarried youth, domestic violence, unfaithfulness within marriage, and the struggle to understand true pregnancy risk and avoid unwanted pregnancies. The drama had a unique aim of dispelling myths about fertility and family planning (FP) by improving fertility awareness. Fertility awareness is actionable information about female and male fertility throughout the life course, and an understanding of how this knowledge applies to one's own circumstances and needs. It enables an understanding of how sex, reproduction and FP interconnect, ultimately improving reproductive health.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The primary aim of the study is to test whether integrating information about fertility, the menstrual cycle, and pregnancy risk into a mass-media serial drama is an effective strategy for increasing fertility awareness and improving family planning attitudes and use.  Secondary aims are to identify the most meaningful messages from the radio drama; describe how listeners applied the information to their lives; assess the effects of listenership on FP outcomes; and qualify differences between listeners who participated in discussion groups and those who did not.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Researchers used a mixed methods approach to evaluate the impact of the radio drama. Post-broadcast, researchers conducted a cross-sectional nationally representative household survey of 1477 women and men of reproductive age to assess differences in FP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors between listeners and non-listeners.</p><p>Qualitative research activities include monthly listener discussion groups throughout the broadcast, and post-intervention focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with listeners in the radio drama’s target audience, men and women ages 18-35.  Nine discussion groups, selected from existing community groups across Rwanda, committed to listening to the radio drama and discussing it monthly.  Group leaders facilitated the discussion, and note takers provided a detailed record. Two districts with discussion groups, Gasabo and Bugesera, were selected as sites for the eight FGDs and 32 IDIs (8 with listeners from the discussion groups and 24 with listeners that did not participate in a discussion group).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>18% of study participants (n=267), were classified as listeners according to the DHS definition of listening to the radio drama at least once a week. Listeners had significantly higher fertility awareness than non-listeners for key concepts, including knowledge of the menstrual cycle and fertile days, the onset of fertility for girls and boys, and postpartum pregnancy risk. Listeners also reported more knowledge of FP methods (OR 3.8), supportive norms (OR 1.4), and self-efficacy to access FP (OR 2.2). Female listeners were significantly more likely to have discussed FP with their partner (OR 2.6) and family, friends, or neighbors in the past three months (OR 2.3). No differences in FP use were found between listeners and non-listeners.</p><p>Qualitative results show discussion increased between parents and children about puberty, and couples about family size and planning. Listeners frequently mentioned fertile days, and how tracking the menstrual cycle and FP use can help prevent unplanned pregnancies.  Older participants used what they learned from the drama to dispel rumors.  One woman said,<em> “I discussed with youth who pray at the same church as me. They thought a woman gets pregnant during the bleeding period only. So I explained the parts of the menstrual cycle, especially the fertile days.” </em>While listeners recalled many fertility awareness concepts, some information related to the fertile days, the menstrual cycle, and post-partum fertility was still confusing. However, listeners who participated in a discussion group had a greater understanding of fertility awareness and FP information in the radio drama.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Impano n’Impamba reached a substantial proportion of the Rwandan population during the year-long drama. It helped facilitate conversations about FP and fertility awareness—often taboo topics in Rwanda. Given widespread misunderstanding of pregnancy risk, fertility awareness and body literacy has the potential to create a more supportive environment for FP use. However, evidence around the implications of fertility awareness on sexual and reproductive health outcomes is only just beginning to be understood and requires further exploration. This study is one of the first to not only assess fertility awareness and FP attitudes and behaviors, but also the link between them. Initial results suggest that integrating fertility awareness into existing social and behavior change communication strategies can help address barriers to FP use. Entertainment-education approaches such as the serial radio drama have the added benefit of reaching a wide audience with a range of information in an engaging way. Development practitioners seeking to address unmet need should consider ways in which fertility awareness can be integrated to create an enabling environment for FP.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Unintended pregnancies can result in poorer health outcomes for women, children and families. Meeting unmet need for effective contraception is essential in decreasing unintended pregnancy. Young people in low and middle-income countries are at particular risk of unintended pregnancies and could benefit from innovative contraceptive interventions. There is some evidence that interventions delivered by mobile phone can improve contraceptive use and knowledge. Supported by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) Innovation Program, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine partnered with IPPF Member Associations in Palestine, Tajikistan and Bolivia to develop and evaluate an intervention delivered by mobile phone messaging. The intervention aimed to improve acceptability and use of the effective contraceptive methods among young people in these countries. We developed the intervention using an approach grounded in behavioral science, which involved the following steps: (1) needs assessment; (2) specifying behavioral change to result from the intervention; (3) selecting behavior change methods to include in the intervention; (4) producing and refining the intervention content. The development process produced similar interventions across the countries. The interventions consist of short daily messages delivered over four months (by text message in Palestine and mobile phone application instant message in Tajikistan and Bolivia).</p>",

Eligibility was as follows: Palestine, women aged 18-24 not using an effective contraceptive method; Tajikistan, men and women aged 16-24; Bolivia, women aged 16-24 who are sexually active, not using an effective contraceptive method and want to avoid a pregnancy. The control in Palestine was text messages about trial participation. The control in Tajikistan and Bolivia was access to a sexual and reproductive health app that provides standard family planning information. The primary outcome was acceptability of at least one method of effective contraception (sample size = 570 in Palestine and Tajikistan). In Bolivia, a co-primary outcome was use of effective contraception (sample size = 1310). Secondary outcomes were use of effective contraception during the study (Palestine and Tajikistan), acceptability of the individual methods, service uptake, unintended pregnancy and induced abortion. Process outcomes were knowledge of effective contraception, perceived norms in relation to using and communicating with partners about contraception, personal agency in using and communicating with partners about contraception, intention to use effective contraception and intervention dose received.

      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These trials were the first in each context to evaluate a highly specified intervention grounded in behavioral science to improve attitudes and use of effective contraception among young people in each country. This project adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests family planning support can be successfully delivered by mobile phone. The multi-contextual evaluation provides additional clarity about what intervention content is most effective. For example, in the Palestine trial, the doubling of acceptability in the intervention arm clearly demonstrates the benefit of the intervention when the control group received no family planning information in this context. In the Tajik trial, the large increase in acceptability from baseline to follow-up and the lack of evidence of a difference in acceptability between the intervention and control group suggests that the intervention content included on the app alone is likely to be effective at changing attitudes. The Bolivia trial results suggest that standard family planning support delivered on app pages may change attitudes and the intervention delivered by instant message through the app may moderately boost this effect. The clear benefit in Palestine, suggestive benefit in Tajikistan and Bolivia and lack of evidence that is associated with an increase in violence, supports the delivery of the intervention in each country. The intervention can be adapted and delivered in other contexts.</p>",

L’âge moyen auquel les adolescentes congolaises ont leur premier enfant est de 17,1 ans; les adolescents quant à eux deviennent pères en moyenne à 18,1 ans. D’après les analyses de l’EDSC, 80,2% des adolescentes sexuellement actives indiquent ne pas vouloir d’enfant et seulement 73,7% d’entre elles ont recours à une méthode contraceptive pour éviter la grossesse. 30,5% des adolescentes évoquent la raison de non connaissance des méthodes. Il sied de noter que 24,2% des adolescentes qui affirment utiliser une méthode de contraception, utilisent les méthodes traditionnelles comme le retrait ou l’abstinence périodique et seulement 1,4% utilisent la pilule, une méthode contraceptive moderne. Ces chiffres, associés au manque d’éducation sexuelle complète, marquent, d’une part, la vulnérabilité des adolescents face aux grossesses non désirées. D’autre part, on constate une forte utilisation de l’internet au Congo avec 650.000 utilisateurs actifs, majoritairement des adolescents. Ce projet, initié par les jeunes de l’ACBEF, a pour objectif d’améliorer l’accès des adolescents et jeunes à l’information et aux services de planification familiale à travers le numérique.</p>",

      "title": "Contraceptive Method Mix Dynamics and Use over Time in Sub-Saharan Africa",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>This paper conducts extensive analysis of trends in contraceptive use and method mix dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. Method mix refers to the percentage distribution of contraceptive use among women, by type of method.  Contraceptive use dynamics continues to be of priority in sub-Saharan Africa because of the high level of fertility in many countries of the region despite various interventions to reduce fertility.  Rapid fertility reductions recorded in the 1980s through much of the 1990s generated optimism of a sustained declined in fertility. Much of the fertility reductions were attributed to family planning programmes. However, subsequent decades have seen the uptake of contraceptive use slowing down in most countries. This slowdown accompanied by stalling fertility has raised concerns over lost interest in family planning. More specifically, the area of contraceptive method mix has become of specific importance because it provides perspectives on both demand and supply side determinants of contraceptive prevalence. For instance, a method mix skewed towards particular methods maybe indicative of limited access to other options or cultural preferences drawing women towards that method at the exclusion of others. Understanding the factors that drive contraception choice is an integral part of increasing contraceptive prevalence in this context.  </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>How have contraceptive method mix dynamics changed over time? We hypothesize that the HIV pandemic in the region is driving an increase in the use of barrier methods over the period as women increasingly seek protection against STIs/HIV, in addition to unwanted pregnancies. Do these trends differ for married versus unmarried women?  We hypothesize that prevalence of barrier methods would be higher among unmarried women. What are the determinants of method choice and how have these changed over time? At the micro-level, we also seek to understand the factors that predict a woman’s choice of a barrier versus non-barrier method.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The analysis will use data from standard DHS surveys. We will use data from 18 countries – Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe – that have at least four standard DHS datasets available. The pooled data from this sample will span over two decades. We will use information on age to create birth cohorts that we will link together to form a pseudo panel. Bivariate analyses will track the proportion of women using barrier methods in each round of data versus the proportion using non-barrier methods and compare that with trends in HIV indicators in the data. Multivariate analyses will use logistic regression to predict barrier method use. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The findings reveal that use of barrier methods for unmarried women rose significantly between the late 1980s and late 2000s in the region in tandem with trends in HIV prevalence. For married women, there was little to no change, except in high HIV prevalence countries. Use of barrier methods peaked in the late 2000s and is currently in decline in the most recent rounds of the DHS as HIV prevalence falls, with the exception of high HIV prevalence countries, who continue to see moderate increases in barrier use for both married and unmarried women.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Research on contraceptive method mix generates new perspectives because it provides information on both demand and supply side determinants of contraceptive prevalence. For instance, a method mix skewed towards particular methods maybe indicative of limited access to other options or cultural preferences drawing women towards that method at the exclusion of others. Understanding the factors that drive contraception choice is an integral part of increasing contraceptive prevalence in this context.  It also give pointers to programme managers and researcher as to whether they are satisfying the needs of clients or not </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Migration from Nepal is longstanding and has increased significantly among the general population from 2.3% in 2001 to 7.2% in 2011. The 1.92 million migrants are predominantly men; currently 32% of married women have husbands working abroad. Remittances increase income to purchase material items, but not necessarily wellbeing, particularly among wives living with their in-laws. Separate studies have shown that wives of migrant husbands report being both more engaged and secluded from the community. Increased workload and dependence on remittances alter existing family and gender norms impacting women’s autonomy and decision-making power. The complexity of gaining access to reproductive health services is heightened for women with migrant husbands in Nepal, where decision-making power is more likely to reside with mothers-in-law as opposed to the left-behind woman.</p><p>From March 2017-2018, the Fertility Awareness for Community Transformation (FACT) project implemented community-level games called Pragati to increase fertility awareness (FA), knowledge around family planning, and couple communication, and combat negative social norms. Games were facilitated by community health workers and other community stakeholders and were well received in the community. Interest and excitement around the games has been high and partners are already scaling them up across Nepal; final results will be presented.</p><p></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Associations between husbands’ migration and women’s health seeking behaviors are undescribed in the literature. This study has two hypotheses:</p>\t<li>Health seeking behaviors will differ between women with husbands living at home and those who have migrated for work. (The direction of this difference is uncertain as the role of extended family is unknown.)</li>\t<li>In communities where the Pragati intervention was implemented, women will have greater health seeking behaviors at endline.</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>A mixed-methods quasi-experimental study was conducted across five districts of Nepal. Three study arms were created within each of the five districts: 1) full intervention that includes facilitated playing with the community of nine Pragati games on FA, FP methods, and social norms with coordinated support from trained health facility staff, 2) facilitated playing of three games on FP methods, and 3) control arm. A standardized questionnaire was administered at baseline (August to September of 2016) and again at endline (March to April of 2018) to a representative sample of 3,645 systematically selected men and women 18 – 39 years old across all districts. Focus group discussions were utilized to contextualize women’s experiences related to reproductive health, autonomy and engagement with their larger communities. Analyses compare reproductive health profiles, gender and decision-making dynamics among married women with and without migrating husbands. Comparisons will be conducted both within and between study arms and districts using Chi-squared tests, regression tests and RMANOVA.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><em>Baseline results:</em> Just less than half the women were married. Forty-three percent of married women had a husband who migrated internationally for work, with rates varying significantly by region and caste. Women with migrating husbands had significantly lower contraceptive use than other married women (9.3% vs. 30.3%, respectively); 36.5% of women with migrant husbands reported that they wished to become pregnant in the next year, versus only 26.1% of other married women. Although women with migrant husbands reported frequent communication with their husbands, they talked about having children less frequently and described their relationships less positively than women with husbands at home. In the absence of their husbands, women with migrant husbands were more likely to report father- and mother-in-law as the main decision-makers in several areas of their lives: such as seeking health care; visiting a family or relatives; or making financial decisions. Women with migrant husbands had less understanding of their fertility than other married women. Differences were greatest around the knowledge of the fertile window during the menstrual cycle and when to avoid unprotected sex if they did not wish to become pregnant (53.5% vs 67.1% and 22.3% vs 33.5%, respectively).</p><p>Final datasets will be analysed in June and July of 2018. Prior to the conference, longitudinal analyses will be conducted and refined for the conference presentation.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The reproductive health decisions of couples in this study were shaped by the social and gender normative composition of their households. Preliminary analyses reflected in-laws assuming decision-making power in the husbands’ absence, which can negatively impact health decisions of women. Previous interventions for women with migrating husbands focus on economic benefits or girls’ schooling. Complementing those decisions with activities that address potential negative gender and power dynamics within homes may facilitate women’s ability to retain power over her health and financial choices. In similar locations in Southeast Asia, where massive rates of male work migration happen, identifying culturally appropriate interventions for this group of women is essential. Additionally, with fathers working abroad for more than a decade, further exploration is merited on the long-term impact of fathers’ absence on children’s socialization and evolving gender roles and norms.</p>",

      "title": "Effects of Socio-cultural factors on Family Planning use in Somaliland ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Somalia has one of the highest Maternal Mortality Rates (MRR) in the world which stands at 732 per 100,000 births. However, family planning which plays a major role in reducing maternal and new born mortality remains unpopular. Religious beliefs, cultural barriers and misconceptions associated with contraceptive use are known to prevent both women and men from accessing reproductive health services and information. Somali mCPR remains at 5.1%. A thorough understanding of the attitudes and practices responsible for this trend is lacking because of the paucity of health data available in Somalia. This also limits the amount and variety of information available to programmers for design of interventions that are unique to the idiosyncrasy of the Somali situation. UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Survey (MICs 2011) is the primary source of data for health status indicators for Somalia but does not include information on socio-cultural and behavioral factors impacting health.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>PSI conducted a Tracking Results Continuously (TRaC) study in 2012, which served as a baseline with a follow up round conducted in 2015. The study sought to understand the levels and trends of identified modern birth spacing behaviors (MBS) and the sociocultural factors that motivate or limit uptake of contraception among the Somali people. It also evaluated people’s exposure to PSI behavior change interventions and related impact on health-seeking behavior. These interventions included TV and radio programs and interpersonal communications (IPC) activities in major urban towns - both targeting women of reproductive age (WRA) in Somaliland to promote family planning</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>It was a cross sectional household survey conducted among households with married women of reproductive age (15-49) who were also caregivers of at least one child under five years. A multi-stage cluster sampling approach was employed to select 2,201 households across five of the six regional capital cities in Somaliland. Eighty-eight clusters were then randomly selected, within which 25 households were identified in each for interviews. Clusters were selected for each strata using probability proportionate to size. The sampling frame was drawn from the list of electoral polling stations.</p><p>Monitoring and evaluation was conducted using UNIANOVA to assess differences between rounds and exposure categories, this included controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Generally, women were more likely to say that modern birth spacing is culturally acceptable, safe, and effective. However, there was no dramatic change in perceptions that modern birth spacing is religiously unacceptable (48.8% in 2012 and 50.7% in 2015) or that pills and injectables can cause infertility with (29.7% in 2012 and 33.7% in 2015 for pills; 35.7% in 2012 and 36.2% in 2015 for injectables). 66% of women still consider traditional methods to be safe and effective. However, women’s perception of risk of unwanted pregnancy increased over time, from 39.2% to 73.2%; likewise, a 12% increase among women who reported that they intend to use birth spacing in the future (14.6% in 2012 and 26.4% in 2015). However, cultural and religious stigma associated with MBS use limits the proportion of respondents who have discussed birth spacing with their husbands to 26% and 28% with other family members. The mean number of children was 7.6 and 84.7% of women still desired to have at least one more child. The desire for large families is considered both culturally and religiously ideal irrespective of income status. The health care provider was the major recommender of MBS, while the mother/mother in-law was the major recommender of LAM or Traditional methods. Furthermore, knowledge of pill and injectable administration had a statistically significant increase over time, with 47.6% in 2012 and 51.5% in 2015 for pills and 8.7% to 13.5% for injectable. %. Current use of birth spacing methods was associated with exposure to behavior</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results of this study imply that the husbands and religious leaders are a major entry point for birth spacing interventions along with the mothers of the WRA who key influencers of decisions are taken by their daughters. Increased knowledge and positive change in perception was associated with exposure to PSI messages. PSI/Somaliland implemented aggressive communication campaigns on the importance of birth spacing methods. Between baseline and follow-up, a clear and statistically significant improvement is seen in comparing exposure to communications with health outcomes. The study shows that those with high exposure were more likely to currently be using a modern method of birth spacing than those at baseline or follow-up with no or low exposure. However, actual use remains low irrespective of the increase in knowledge and awareness of modern birth spacing methods and their benefits. Most women cannot initiate discussions on birth spacing with their husbands and family members, because it is still considered to be a taboo as the desire for large families and religious beliefs reign supreme. Behavior change interventions should therefore be designed to target populations that have the capacity to take decisions or influence the decision makers. </p>",

      "title": "Obstacles to Access and Use of Family Planning amongst women in union in low contraceptive practice settings in sub-Saharan Africa: the case of the Republic of Benin",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The new investment framework in family planning (FP) in developing countries is one of the most effective interventions to guide national health and development planning by decreasing numerous unintended pregnancies,  the cause of unsafe induced abortions with its associated risks for mother and infant mortality (Joshi, 2009). Gaining access to FP services improves maternal and child health outcomes, and affords women more opportunities to become economically active (Blue Ventures, 2015). Despite efforts and commitments to improving the use of contraceptives, the rate at which people use contraceptives in Benin Republic remain low (modern CPR=9% in 2011/2012) even though the knowledge of contraception is widespread in most parts of the country, the knowledge of each method being 85% (INSAE &amp; ICF, 2013). It has been noticed over time, that there is a weak appropriation of the use of contraceptives especially among married or in union women; the rates of increase are low: modern CPR which is already low, has increased by only 2 points in a decade that is from 6.7% in 2001 to 8.8% in 2011/2012. There is then a need for more understanding of the barriers behind contraceptive uptake among women who are married or in union.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Findings from quantitative analysis from past studies in Benin Republic (Dansou, Adekunle, &amp; Arowojolu, 2017) clarified the determinants of contraceptive practice and suggested the need for qualitative studies to explore barriers undermining contraceptives uptake among Beninese women living in union / marriage. The present studies attempts to fill such gap in order to provide policy makers with practical and key recommendations for future interventions with the ultimate goal of improving contraceptive uptake among married women. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data were gathered from in-depth interviews (93 KII) of participants from various backgrounds (reproductive age women, men, fathers in-law, and mothers in-law, representatives of community based associations, representatives of NGOs specializing in RH, health workers, religious leaders including endogenous leaders) and focus groups discussion (12 FGD). Data collection were conducted between January and April 2017 across the country: northern, southern and center where one urban and one rural area were investigated in each region. A total of 199 participants were interviewed using in-depth interviews and focus group discussion guides. Ethical approval was obtained from “Comité National d’Ethique pour la Recherche en Santé (CNERS) of Benin before the study was carried out.</p><p>Transcription of notes from the tape recording of the discussions and interviews was performed. The transcriptions were carefully compared with notes taken during data collection, and a final comprehensive list of the ideas raised by the respondents, then examined and categorized according to the main purpose of the study. Afterwards, they were divided into categories of similar responses according to the study goals. Lastly, the content analysis of records was done highlighting factors which help to understand underlying logics and barriers undermining FP of use.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Traditional and cultural beliefs continue to shape the reproductive life of Beninese. Among others, cultural and religious beliefs emerged as important barriers for family planning use. Communities’ influence especially partners and family in-law’s roles also emerged. Health workers’ attitudes towards health service users and side effects of contraceptives were also reported by many participants as an important deterrent for not using FP. Religious leaders also disapprove of family planning. The main reason remains that family planning use is against the law of the creator. Moreover, talking and advising people in churches and mosques to access and adopt family planning is like pushing them especially women and young girls into prostitution and fornication. Family planning according to some religious leaders may, to some extent be adopted by married women only for birth limitation. For some participants, family planning is the business of unmarried and especially separated/divorced women who are afraid of having unclaimed pregnancies. In short, they adopt family planning just to meet their sexual needs the moment they are out of marriage/union.</p><p>A religious leader narrated:</p><p> “<em>In Catholic Church, we disapprove of FP because we noticed that women and girls know that by adopting FP they are free in their movements especially sexually relationships. Girls in particular get into fornication and prostitution and married women in extra-conjugal sexual relationships.… Therefore, talking about family planning in churches is like encouraging this phenomenon….” </em>(Leader Christian religion in in-depth interview, Bembèrèkè).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The study’s findings revealed leading barriers undermining contraceptive uptake among women in union/married and gave more insights into the way forward for enhancing access to and the use of FP even in extended postpartum period. Among them, there is a need:</p><ul>\t<li>To move beyond individual women in interventions to improve women’s use of reproductive health services to target different stakeholders at multiple levels including husbands, in-laws, family, and community leaders including religious leaders, for an effective and positive outcome.</li>\t<li>To strengthen actions to address health providers’ poor attitudes toward health service users. Result based-financing initiative was discovered with great positive impact on the matter which needs strengthening to be effective and in place everywhere across the country.</li>\t<li>To financially support or take a complete charge of users experiencing side effects of contraceptives.</li>\t<li>To address cultural and religious barriers by strengthening sensitization campaigns for people in remote areas especially where most inhabitants still rely on their experiences of culture and traditions which do not always guaranty a good health outcome.</li>\t<li>To make FP services physically close to people and services available especially in remote areas where challenges are greater and current services minimum.</li>\t<li>To create and increase users’ awareness about all aspect of reproductive health services including the side effects of these services. People need to know about all aspects of services and even the worst outcomes they may experience in using services.</li></ul>",

      "title": "Overcoming complex barriers to family planning uptake at household level",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Timed and Targeted Counselling (TTC) is a family-inclusive behaviour change communication (BCC) approach targeting pregnant women and their supporters, from early pregnancy up until their child is two years of age. The programme is delivered through appropriately timed household visits and a comprehensive set of messages appropriate to gestation or age, using an interactive story-telling methodology, and modelled on the 7-11 framework of essential life-saving health practices and services. Family planning elements promoted through the approach include healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy, and uptake of short- and long-term family planning methods. It differs from classic BCC methods through the use of a dialogue and negotiation approach in which current practices are assessed and feasible changes or solutions are negotiated and agreed upon through dialogue between Community Health Workers (CHWs) and parents and key decision-makers in the home. TTC aims to transform health outcomes through improved demand for services and progressive changes in household health, family planning, nutrition and hygiene practices. World Vision UK commissioned qualitative research in Kenya and India to better understand the barriers and stakeholder perceptions related to behaviours that are more challenging to change at household level, where we see less consistent results.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The research sought to understand how effective the TTC approach is in achieving its objective, to create household behaviour change across the various targeted behaviours. This included a deeper focus on one specific behavioural indicator, the birth plan, as a means of exploring the broader social, economic and political barriers to behaviour change at household level, as achieving the components of a birth plan often requires overcoming complex barriers. The research then went on to explore how the emerging themes applied to other key behaviours, including uptake of family planning methods.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>An independent research team was recruited to carry out the research, using qualitative methods. In Kenya, the field research took place during September 2017 in Siaya County in southwest Kenya, in the Community Units of both Bar Olengo and Mur Malenga, for comparison purposes. In India, the field research took place in Tamil Nadu, in the village of Kumananthozhu. Sampling of CHWs and their supervisors was through proportional random sampling, households through random sampling and World Vision (WV) staff through purposive sampling. Triangulation of data was achieved through semi-structured key informant interviews (KIIs) with mothers, CHWs, CHW supervisors and WV staff; and focus group discussions (FGDs) with mothers, CHWs and CHW supervisors. FGDs were used as a research tool to allow for in-depth exploration of beliefs and practises related to maternal and child health in the local context. KIIs were used to gather more individual data and understand whether the health visits created behaviour change in the particular household - and why or why not - similar to the qualitative research ‘barrier analysis’ method of identifying ‘doers’ and ‘non-doers’ of behaviours. The research data was analysed using the Framework Analysis, with thematic analysis facilitated through Nvivo Pro 11 software.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Key findings that are useful to demand creation approaches and behaviour change related to family planning include:</p><ul>\t<li>All research participants in both Kenya and India identified challenges with involving the ‘husbands’ and mothers/mothers-in-law (household decision makers) in the health visits and in decision-making regarding health (including family planning), despite the aim of the programme to do so. Wider social and economic barriers were consistently identified as the reasons for this, including deep set traditions and practices, as well as short funding cycles which don’t allow time to adequately address the barriers through robust contextualisation.</li>\t<li>In both contexts, family planning was most identified by research participants as a difficult behaviour to change, the main reason being due to misconceptions, according to mothers and CHWs, which was explored further through the research.</li>\t<li>Where positive shifts have been noted in the acceptability of family planning methods and improved birth spacing, participants noted the influence of multiple programmes by different actors, reinforcing the theory underpinning multi-source BCC interventions.</li>\t<li>A notable finding from Kenya was that household members and CHWs alike perceive that shifts are taking place in their context related to the involvement of the wider community in decision-making at household level, with multiple participants highlighting the increasing individualism they experience which marks a disconnectedness between households. This is likely to have an impact on the way BCC programming is designed in future, particularly in settings where community-based approaches are prioritised.</li></ul>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The research included a literature review of MNCH behaviour change programmes, which highlighted the need for formative research as a critical element of behaviour change programming. This research reinforced that MNCH programming often lacks robust formative research at early stages of an intervention, and that MNCH implementers have much to learn from other sectors, including WASH, in this area.</p><p>Mothers themselves strongly identified their perceived barriers to change in our research, highlighting their powerlessness to tackle wider cultural, traditional and religious barriers in particular, with religious leaders (Kenya) and mothers-in-law (India) still holding the greatest influence with regard to family planning methods. CHW workloads and lack of resources remains a critical issue in these contexts, an issue that continues to challenge development agencies globally. The research highlighted the enlightenment of key stakeholders regarding the issues, and poses a challenge for Ministries of Health and partners to find innovative solutions to these kinds of persistent challenges. The literature review explored some of the ways in which this is being addressed but reflected the lack of robust solutions to date.</p><p>Through this presentation, the audience will be challenged to consider the complexities of barriers to behaviour change and learn from the perceptions of household members and community health workers themselves, who are able to best able to suggest the road to greater empowerment of women of reproductive age.</p>",

      "title": "Understanding contraceptive use dynamics in the context of widespread labor migration and spousal separation in Nepal: A case study",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>A spouse’s migration plays an important role in a couple’s use of contraceptive methods and family planning (FP) intentions. Analyses of data from the 2011 Demographic and Health Survey in Nepal have shown that current use of any contraceptive method was significantly lower (23%) among women whose spouses were currently away as compared to women living with their spouses (62%). Contraceptive use dynamics – including uptake and discontinuation, method switching, and method failure – can be complex for women with migrating spouses. Not having sex frequently or the absence of a spouse were the primary reasons for not using a contraceptive method given by women “left behind” in 2011. In addition, women may stop using contraception when their husbands migrate in a context wherein the fidelity and reputations of women “left behind” may be under surveillance. A deeper investigation of the contraceptive use dynamics of Nepali women with labor migrant husbands is needed to identify these women’s reproductive needs and desires and inform the design of FP programs that are sensitive to their unique service needs.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In light of existing gaps in understanding of the contraceptive use dynamics among women with migrant spouses in Nepal, qualitative and quantitative data were examined to explore whether and how Nepali women’s contraceptive use dynamics and intentions change as their spouses migrate for work. These findings are used to identify limitations of existing FP indicators in this context and to suggest alternative ways to 1) measure contraceptive use dynamics and 2) better use existing data gathered from reproductive health questionnaires that are more relevant to the lives of couples separated by migration.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Nepal Health Communication Capacity Collaborative (HC3) Project conducted a panel study in 2015 and 2017 that measured women’s reproductive behaviors, fertility preferences, and contraceptive practices in intervention and comparison districts in Nepal. Due to the high prevalence of Nepali men’s migration, this survey included a migration module to capture details about the migration experiences of women’s spouses. A spouse’s recent migration history was defined as having been absent for at least three consecutive months within the past five years. Migration destination and duration of absence were measured at both baseline and endline using women’s responses about their spouses’ current migration trajectories as well as their migration patterns according to a monthly calendar.</p><p>A qualitative study was conducted in 2016 with women whose spouses had recent labor migration experience. Two rounds of semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 women. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated, and coded for analysis in Atlas.ti. The analytical approach was informed by the framework method. Findings from this qualitative study were used to develop questions for the endline survey conducted in 2017. These questions included the anticipated return date of women’s spouses and women’s fertility and FP intentions following their spouses’ return.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Women interviewed in the qualitative study rarely reported contraceptive use while separated from their spouses. While accepted FP indicators might recognize these women as non-users or having an unmet need for FP, participants engaged in thoughtful decision-making processes about their contraceptive use in conjunction with their spouses’ migration patterns. Some participants discontinued their method when their husbands left and readopted or planned to re-adopt the method upon their return. For some, the timing of adoption (e.g. 2-3 days before or a week before) was linked with a provider’s recommendations. Recommendations to continue taking contraception after a spouse leaves were not necessarily followed.</p><p>This logic of stopping and starting contraception was confirmed in the quantitative data. Of 1648 married women of reproductive age with a child under five interviewed at endline, 42% had currently migrating spouses. Current use of any contraceptive method was low (13%) and unmet need high (spacing: 26%; limiting: 52%). A smaller percentage of women with an unmet need for spacing had husbands returning in the next three months (17%) as compared to later (19-59 months: 33%; p<p>Among women whose spouses were migrating and who were not currently using contraception, 92% said they were likely to use a method in the future. Most who intended to use but were not currently using a method because their spouses were away (n=440) planned to use after the husband’s return (72%), while 7% said before the return, 16% said the day of return, and 5% said after having another child.</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Despite concerns about the relevance of FP indicators like current contraceptive use and unmet need for transregional or transnational migrant couples, the Government of Nepal and FP programs in Nepal continue to rely on current use and unmet need as key FP indicators. In response, we suggest two additional approaches to improving our understanding of women’s fertility preferences, intentions, and reproductive health practices. First, researchers should identify new ways to disaggregate existing data by characteristics of a spouse’s migration status (e.g. destination or duration). A second necessary approach includes the addition of more detailed migration-related questions to existing reproductive health surveys in Nepal such as questions about a spouse’s anticipated return date or women’s fertility desires or intentions upon a spouse’s return.</p><p>With knowledge of a potential return date, disaggregation of current contraceptive use or unmet need could inform the design of interventions to help women fulfill their reproductive health needs at times relevant to their lived realities. The finding that most women planned to start using a contraceptive method after their spouses returned identifies a clear need for programs working with migrant couples to focus on the return event to identify the appropriate and most effective timing for contraceptive uptake. These suggestions may mark useful ways to extend our limited knowledge of the reproductive needs of women whose husbands are migrating or may migrate in the future.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In rural Nepal, the modern contraceptive prevalence rate is 41%, and the unmet need for family planning is 25% (DHS, 2016). The Sustaining Health Outcomes through the Private Sector Plus (SHOPS Plus) project supports the Nepal CRS Company (CRS), a social marketing organization, to increase modern contraception access and use in rural, underserved communities. To catalyze reductions in unmet need, CRS’s <em>Ghar Ghar Maa Swasthya</em> (GGMS) project in rural Nepal generates family planning demand through behavior change communication and increases contraceptive access through social marketing.</p><p>The SHOPS Plus team conducted a knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) survey in the GGMS areas to understand barriers to family planning uptake using the opportunity, ability, and motivation (OAM) behavior change framework (Chapman, 2004). The OAM framework was developed within the context of social marketing and focuses on mutable behavioral determinants that social marketing interventions and behavior change communication can influence. Our findings present key OAM determinants of and impediments to increased contraceptive access and use in extremely remote areas. This study can inform family planning programs throughout rural South Asia and is vitally important and timely given the Commission on the Status of Women’s 2018 priority of achieving gender equality for rural women.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<ul>\t<li>What are the OAM determinants affecting family planning uptake and use in rural Nepal?\t<ul>\t\t<li>How do OAM determinants of family planning differ between current users, intending users, and other non-users?</li>\t</ul>\t</li>\t<li>How can behavior change programs in rural Nepal and Southern Asia leverage OAM determinants to better generate demand for and increase use of modern contraception?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted a household survey in 49 primarily rural districts of Nepal. The survey sampled 3,293 women aged 15-49. The survey used a multi-stage cluster design stratified by hill and mountain areas. Population data from the 2011 Nepal Census was used to allocate the sample across the 49 districts using a probability proportionate to size methodology.  Data collectors selected households randomly after completing a household listing in each selected cluster, which was defined at the ward level. All eligible women (i.e., 15-49 years) in selected households were interviewed, and there was no household replacement. A structured survey instrument, reviewed by local stakeholders and piloted in the field, was used to collect information on family planning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Data collection was conducted from December to February, 2018. Data analysis used descriptive statistics to examine determinants related to family planning uptake and use. Analysis relies on the OAM behavior change framework to contextualize findings and make programmatic recommendations to overcome barriers to family planning use. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary findings show that behavior change communication should focus on addressing family planning barriers related to societal opportunity factors, social norms affecting women’s ability to obtain contraception, and individual motivation.</p><p>Opportunity: Non-users were more likely than current or intending users to report that shopkeepers make them feel bad when buying contraceptives. There is a need to empower female contraceptive purchasers and sensitize shopkeepers to this issue so that potential clients perceive contraceptives as available to them without experiencing shame or embarrassment. </p><p>Ability: The majority of respondents felt that it is inappropriate to use contraception until a woman has had one child. Such norms undermine women’s ability to ask for and obtain contraception.  However, substantially fewer women (and even fewer current and intending users) agreed that it is inappropriate to use contraception until a woman has reached her desired family size. There is an opportunity to expand contraception use for spacing purposes after the first child is born, while more intensive behavior change interventions would be required to increase family planning use to delay the birth of the first child.</p><p>Motivation: Nearly 90% of non-pill and non-injectable users reported that they believe these methods could harm their body compared to approximately 75% of women who use these methods. The motivation arm of the OAM model asserts that perceived benefit is a necessary condition for behavior change. Interventions should focus on altering these attitudes so that women see the benefits of hormonal contraceptives and are motivated to use these methods without fear. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our survey findings are representative of rural Nepal, a geographic context that is extremely remote with limited access to health services. Results will be used to strengthen CRS’s GGMS program and to ultimately help meet Nepal’s FP2020 goals. Identifying the OAM behavioral determinants of and impediments to family planning uptake and use fills a key evidence gap in rural Nepal. These data are critical to inform behavior change programs to increase sustained use of modern methods in the most vulnerable and underserved parts of the country.</p><p>Many survey results are not isolated to the context of Nepal but are likely relevant in similar low-income, rural communities in South Asia. For example, social norms regarding the importance of having a child soon after marriage and attitudes related to fear of side effects are pervasive throughout the region. Use of the OAM model helps to translate our analysis into action, allowing program implementers to clearly link conditions for successful behavior change to intervention design.  Through this framework, our findings showcase the social and behavior change necessary to catalyze demand generation among women living in extremely rural areas of South Asia and reach national family planning goals in the region. Moreover, the focus of our study on rural women aligns with and furthers gender equality priorities related to reaching women in marginalized communities, as outlined in the 2018 Commission of the Status of Women session.</p>",

      "title": "Women’s dilemmas regarding family planning decisions: results from a three-country qualitative study",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Efforts to promote use of modern family planning to reduce unwanted fertility is projected to have averted 44% maternal deaths in 2008. Projections indicate that further elimination of global unmet need would prevent another 29% of maternal deaths. Despite these advances, a sizable proportion of women at risk of pregnancy and who do not wish to conceive do not use contraception. To address this gap, the primary focus of programs has been to raise awareness and improve access, yet a sizable proportion of women with unmet need indicate they have no intention to use contraception in the future. Actually, knowledge and access are the least common cited reasons for unmet need in DHS surveys, while unrecognized need or side effects are more frequently acknowledged. Concerns over the physical and functional repercussions of contraception also account for high rates of method discontinuation, countering the effects of programs and policies promoting family planning access. While side effects are commonly cited as barriers to family planning use in low and middle-income countries, their physical and social repercussions are rarely discussed as part of the tradeoffs of family planning decisions.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The current study builds on a larger qualitative cross-cultural study on women’s and girls’ sexual and reproductive empowerment in three African countries, to elicit women’s family planning dilemmas across cultures and social groups. We specifically aim to address the following questions:</p><ul>\t<li>How do women understand and relate their symptoms when using modern contraception and how do these symptoms affect their lives?</li>\t<li>How do these concerns affect their family planning decisions?</li>\t<li>How are these experiences seen as similar or different across cultures and across the life span?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Women’s and Girls’ Empowerment (WGE) qualitative study was conducted in four sites across three countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria (Anambra and Kano states), and Uganda. Within each site, focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews  (IDIs) were conducted among women aged 15-49 and men aged 18 and older. Specifically, FGDs were equally divide among urban and rural settings (8 comprising women, 2 comprising men). IDI participants included 12 couples, who were interviewed separately, and 6 unmarried women, who were equally divided between urban and rural settings.</p><p>Semi-structured guides were used to oversee discussions around WGE, including questions about family planning attitudes, experiences and decision-making. All interviews were conducted by trained interviewers in local language, audio-recorded, transcribed and translated verbatim by local partners. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used, starting with qualitative investigators from each site reading transcripts to identify emerging themes. These initial themes led to a set of cross-site codes shared that were revised using an iterative process. Local partners coded the transcripts in Atlas.ti using the cross-site codes. This analysis is based on themes related to family planning attitudes and misconceptions; patterns of responses across sites and participant groups were examined.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Respondents extensively discussed negative experiences with modern methods, from unspecified signs of fatigue and weakness to more specific symptoms of menstrual dysregulation and reproductive ill health. Many women shared personal stories of extensive and irregular bleeding when using injectables or implants which lead to discontinuation. Participants across sites discussed the deleterious effects of these symptoms on relationship quality, excessive bleeding and vaginal dryness “killing the appetite for sex”. These experiences were relayed by peers and shared within the larger community, deterring many women from initiating or continuing these methods.</p><p>Concerns over pain and body injuries were also recurring cross-site themes. Womb impairment in the form of blood clots, fibroids, or displacement were often cited as a result of using IUDs, while blood loss could lead to womb removal.  Participants evoked the issue of implants and IUD disappearance inside the body, which lead to painful and complicated removals but also generated fear of longer-term effects such as cancer. The repercussions of these methods on women’s fertility were of particular concern especially as duration of use increased. Thus, participants described contraceptive induced sequelae in the form of “weakened womb”, “rusted ovaries or “burned or spoiled eggs”. These concerns were grounded in women’s own experiences of delayed conception and community narratives about women’s difficulties becoming pregnant. The emotional and social consequences of delayed or impaired conception weighted heavily in the balance between the risks and benefits of using contraception and therefore operated as strong regulators of women’s and couple’s family planning decisions.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>These results bring to light women’s dilemmas in making contraceptive decisions, in the face of frequent physical discomfort or complications (insertions or removals), and fear of long-term sequelae. Many considered that the health and social risks they ascribed to moderately or most effective contraception outweighed the benefits of avoiding pregnancy, informing their decision to stop or avoid use to preserve their sexual lives and reproductive capacity. Such apprehensions are likely critical in explaining low family planning intentions among women with unmet need in DHS surveys. With the scaling-up of family planning programs encouraging long acting reversible contraception and injectables, special efforts should concentrate on quality improvement of services to insure proper insertion and removal of long acting methods and offer comprehensive counseling to inform about expected side effects and offer alternative options.</p>",

      "title": "Contraceptive use and unintended fertility in 37 developing countries",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family Planning programs in developing countries aim to empower women to achieve their reproductive goals, which in turn, reduces unintended fertility and other related adverse health consequences for themselves, their children, and their family. Women’s contraceptive use increases the length of birth intervals and, thus, assists women to reduce unintended pregnancies/ births.  The 2012 Family Planning Summit held in London established a goal of reaching 120 million additional users of modern contraception by 2020. The Family Planning 2020 (FP2020), a global partnership established to measure progress toward achieving the ‘120 by 20’ goal, tracks the effect of contraception use on unintended fertility with two indicators—number of unintended pregnancies; and number of unintended pregnancies averted due to modern contraceptive use. These indicators are estimated from simulation models. </p><p>The purpose of this paper is to use direct information, i.e., women’s report on unintended fertility to measure the “extended use-effectiveness” of different contraceptive methods. The concept of extended use-effectiveness was introduced in 1968 to measure effectiveness of a method over an extended period of time. Extended use-effectiveness can also be used to track progress made by family planning programs towards achieving their objective of empowering women with the right to avoid unintended childbearing. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Contraceptive methods are usually compared on their theoretical/clinical effectiveness and use-effectiveness in preventing a pregnancy under typical conditions of use. The period of exposure considered in measuring “extended use-effectiveness” of a method, includes all segments of use and nonuse of contraception over a period following contraceptive initiation. Extended use-effectiveness of contraceptive methods are assessed by: (1) Percent of women who have at least one birth during a five year period, and (2) Percent of women who report that their most recent birth/pregnancy was unintended. Variations in these indicators are examined by method nonuse and method-specific use for 37 developing countries.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Prospective designs are required to estimate extended use-effectiveness. Instead, retrospective calendar data from the Demographic and Health Surveys are used to mimic a prospective design. Calendar data include contraceptive use status for each month and fertility intentions for all births and current pregnancy.</p><p>First, the contraceptive use status of each woman at 5-years preceding the interview (t-5) is determined, and women are classified into five categories: no method, traditional method, short-term reversible contraception (STRC), long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), and permanent method.</p><p>Second, women are classified into three categories according to fertility intention status of their most recent birth, which includes current pregnancy or birth closest to the interview (if not currently pregnant): no birth/pregnancy during t-5 and t, intended birth/current pregnancy (wanted then), and unintended birth/current pregnancy (wanted later or never wanted).</p><p>Third, women are cross-classified by their contraceptive use status at time t-5 and the fertility intention status of most recent birth/current pregnancy during t-5 and t. Percent distribution of women in each contraceptive use category is computed to estimate two indicators: (1) percent of women with at least one birth during t-5 and t, and (2) percent of women who reported that their most recent birth/current pregnancy was unintended.  </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>This analysis is based on 468,504 currently married women in 37 developing countries. In terms of contraceptive use at time t-5, 5% reported using a traditional method, 13% a STRC, 4% LARC, and 9% were using a permanent method. The remaining 70% were not using any contraceptive method.</p><p>In terms of fertility intentions, 44% reported that their most recent birth/current pregnancy was intended, 9% mistimed, and 7% unwanted. The remaining 41% did not have a birth during t-5 and t. This means that 59% of all women had at least one birth (or current pregnancy) during t-5 and t, and that 16% reported that their recent birth was unintended.</p><p>Among those not using any method at t-5, 72% had at least one birth during the subsequent 5-year period. In comparison, 41% of traditional method users, 46% of STRC users, 32% LARC uses, and 0.3% of permanent method users had at least one birth during the subsequent 5-year period.  Among all non-users at t-5, 18% reported that their most recent birth was unintended. In comparison, 17% of tradition method users, 16% of STRC users, 9% of LARC users, and 0.3% of permanent method users reported that their most recent birth was unintended.</p><p>As expected, in terms of extended use-effectiveness, permanent methods are the most effective methods followed by LARCs. However, traditional methods seems to be as effective as STRC in averting a birth as well as in terms of the occurrence of an unintended birth during the subsequent 5-year period.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Traditional methods are typically deemed as less effective in preventing pregnancy, and therefore have been largely neglected in the global discourse on family planning. This analysis, however, suggests that traditional methods are much more effective than no method use at averting births (59% vs 28%). Moreover, the use of traditional methods appears to be as effective as STRC in preventing a birth and in terms of women reporting that a birth was unintended. In terms of unintended births, there is very little difference among nonusers, traditional method users, and STRC users. A lack of difference among these three groups may indicate that the selection of a method depends upon intensity of women’s desire to regulate their fertility.</p><p>When the two indicators used in this paper are subtracted from 100, they can be used as indicators of successful rights-based family planning, which emphasizes women’s right to have children, if and when, they want. In this sense, success is indicated by not having a birth or having only an intended birth.</p><p>Various limitations of this study are acknowledged. First, methods are grouped instead of considering individual methods. Second, intended and unintended status of a birth is based on retrospective reports. Third, the period of exposure considered in this analysis may also include the effect of abortion and other factors like the absence of husbands.</p><p>Variations by countries and regions and the reasons for these variations will be discussed.  Further analyses will restrict the period of exposure to 3 years and exclude women with multiple births.</p>",

      "title": "Learning for Adapting: Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) for Family Planning in Legazpi City, Philippines",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning is a key issue in the Philippines, where the 2017 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) estimates 53% of married women aged 15-49 years do not want another child and 15% want another child but prefer to wait two or more years. The survey estimates 17% of married and 49% of unmarried sexually active women have an unmet need for family planning. Highlighting the need for family planning education and intervention.    </p><p>Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) for family planning is at least 98% effective at preventing pregnancy when all criteria are met; (1) the mother is exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfeeding, (2) the mother is amenorrhoeic, and (3) the baby is less than six months old. LAM is a common and accepted form of family planning in the Philippines.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The USAID funded-LuzonHealth project conducted a prospective evaluation in Legazpi City to inform the enhancement of guidelines aimed at increasing LAM compliance and encouraging a second form of contraceptive once LAM protection expires. LAM compliance, reasons for non-compliance, family planning referral and uptake of secondary modern family planning methods were tracked over a nine-month period among 521 postpartum women.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>All women who delivered and resided in Legazpi City, August-October 2016 were selected for this evaluation (761). Women who did not participate in a minimum of one interview/month during the evaluation were excluded. Records with incomplete and/or inconsistent responses were also excluded. Ultimately, 521 women were included.</p><p>Breast Feeding Support Group (BFSG) members followed-up with the women monthly for eight months. Interviews were conducted at participants home, during routine postnatal check-ups or immunization visits.  During interviews, data was collected on breastfeeding practices, use of other modern family planning methods and return of menses.</p><p>When at least one of the LAM criteria were not met, the participant was referred to Barangay Service Point Officers, who provide family planning information. If the participant wished to space/limit her pregnancies, she was then referred to Legazpi City Health Center where she received family planning counseling and services.</p><p>Focus group discussions were held among BFSG members (8 participants), nurses (8 participants), and Legazpi city health department nutrition and population officers. Key informant interviews were conducted among the regional and provincial nutrition program coordinators and the Legazpi city health officer.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated demonstrating focusing on duration of LAM compliance and shift to non-LAM modern family planning methods.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The evaluation found that at three months postpartum, 75% of women either met LAM criteria or had shifted to a non-LAM modern family planning method. In month six 87% of women no longer met LAM criteria and of these only 31% had shifted to an alternative modern family planning method. This means that at six-months postpartum 57% of the women in this evaluation were not protected against pregnancy through modern family planning methods. By postpartum month six, 66% of the women had been referred to family planning counseling, yet of those referred only 26% reported using non-LAM modern family planning methods.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This evaluation clearly indicates scale-up of non-LAM modern family planning does not sufficiently complement the scale-down of LAM compliance. There is a need to increase client knowledge and understanding of LAM as a temporary family planning method with a strong focus on preparing to shift to another form of modern family planning once LAM protection expires. Additionally, there is great need to restructure the referral mechanism to ensure efficacy and quality of care.</p><p>Evidence-based learning is critical for effective adaptation of project implementation. The use of appropriately designed operational research is critical for assessing the successes and limitations of project implementation, that cannot be measured using planned monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). Operational research provides defendable evidence for decision-making, strengthening the ability for projects to adapt. The provision of clear and statistically sound results serves as a catalyst for policy change at many levels. Outcomes from this evaluation have been used to inform postnatal follow-up guidelines and referral practices and encourage community health workers to track LAM compliance during follow-up visits.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p><strong>Background:</strong>- Family planning programs, through promoting the use of contraceptives, have played an important role in reducing fertility is many countries in the early stage of implementation of the programs. The focus is to promote couples to adopt contraceptive use; therefore contraceptive prevalence has been used as an indicator to evaluate the implementation of family planning programmes. However, the effectiveness of the programmes cannot be adequately measured by merely an increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate. Through the years, India’s family planning programme has focused primarily on sterilization. Both programme targets and performance evaluations have emphasized numbers of sterilizations performed annually. For this reason, there has been little incentive for programme managers or field workers to promote temporary contraceptive methods, such as pills or condoms. Discontinuation rates for temporary methods have been high, in no small part because of the poor quality of services offered for these methods. Thus programme priorities account in large part for both the low prevalence and the high discontinuation rates for temporary contraceptive methods.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p><strong>Research Question:</strong></p><ul>\t<li>Whether contraceptive failure rate and abandonment by method based on, 36 months and 60 months differ?</li>\t<li>Do the reasons behind abandonment differ by selected characteristics?</li></ul><p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><p>With the above backgrounds considerations the specific objectives of this study are:</p>\t<li>To examine the failure, and abandonment by different spacing methods of family planning.</li>\t<li>To know the reasons behind contraceptive failure and abandonment by method.</li><p><strong>Research hypothesis:     </strong></p>\t<li>Women from poor economic status tend to have higher relative risk for abandonment.</li>\t<li>Women having health related reasons more likely to discontinue family planning method.</li><p></p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Data Source: </strong>The data for the present study is taken from the third round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) conducted during 2015-16. The variables that have been analyzed for fulfilling the objectives of the study are use of family planning, reasons for discontinuation in family planning use and pregnancy history. In NFHS-4, the information on these aspects is also given in calendar months during Five-years preceding the survey. Cox-regression model has been used to analyze calendar data <strong>Methodology:</strong> Understanding the dynamics of contraceptive use is greatly enhanced by indicators such as contraceptive discontinuation rate, by reason for discontinuation, and contraceptive failure rates. Estimates of these indicators are best obtained by the application of life table techniques which allows for the inclusion of censor segment of contraceptive use in the estimation procedure. Life table rates are duration specific so they show how the rate of discontinuation and failure changes with duration of use. The basic idea of the life table as applied to contraceptive discontinuation is that the duration of use is broken down into monthly intervals. The number of discontinuation and the number of women-months of exposure are tabulated for each interval and then the probabilities of discontinuing.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Key Finding:- </strong>The study shows that mainly fertility and health related reasons were the reasons behind discontinue for the last method. Method related reason was also having its significance in abandonment of the last method in all the selected states There was not much variation exist when reasons were distributed over the socio-economic background characteristics. Age, residence, number of children living and mass media exposure showed some variation in a few states. Pearl pregnancy index was generally lower for five years exposure period as compare to three years exposure. In general, index was higher for rhythm and withdrawal in almost all the cases.</p><p>Relative risks of abandonment were calculated after combining rhythm and withdrawal. It was not possible to provide relative risks for abandonment for condom in case of Gujarat due to small sample. In all the cases, those women who had desire for additional child have higher relative risk to discontinue the method. In case of mass media exposure, women those had full exposure of mass media have shown high relative risk of abandonment of rhythm/withdrawal method. This might be due to switching to modern method of spacing method. In the limitations of this study, one can mention that to study the propensity to go for abortion in case of method failure will be able to reveal the determination of desire family size in different population segment. However, this portion of the study could not be carried out due to time constraints</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p><strong>Knowledge contribution</strong>: The study suggests that programmes should have fair provisions on inter personal communication and counselling on the efficacy and possible side effects of any contraceptive method before providing the method. To ensure method continuity, the family planning program should extend its role from providing contraceptive methods to assisting clients who experience method-related side effects to choose a more suitable method and thus mitigate the risk of abandonment method and experiencing unwanted pregnancy. The strategies should be framed in order to identify the time following the last birth at which discontinuation of a particular method use is acceptable so that the health of mother as well as children can be maintained. Moreover, adoption of appropriate family planning policies can reduce the extent of discontinuation of contraceptive method use thereby reducing the risk of unwanted fertility. Improve the skills of family planning workers so that they can address a woman’s concerns after a contraceptive failure. Without immediate and proper action, failure rates will increase or remains at the present level, and contraceptive failure will continue to contribute to unwanted births in coming future.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Understanding when and how pregnancy can occur is something many people take for granted. Yet, when asked specific questions about fertility or menstruation, correct responses are far from guaranteed. Survey questions (items) that ask about fertility often only touch upon one or two aspects of the menstrual cycle or the criteria for using Lactational Amenorrhea Method of family planning.  The scope of fertility related items is vast and identifying the appropriate set of items is complicated by programmatic outcomes. Since we associate this foundational knowledge with increased likelihood that individuals will use family planning, establishing a statistically validated fertility awareness scale is needed.</p><p>The Institute for Reproductive Health defines Fertility Awareness (FA) as actionable information about fertility throughout the life course and the ability to apply this knowledge to one’s own circumstances and needs. FA includes information about the onset and conclusion of fertility, menstruation, ovulation and the fertile window of the menstrual cycle, among other things. How fertility awareness is defined—what it includes and what it does not—is important because of potentially different influences on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) behaviors and outcomes, including FP use.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We hypothesize that 10 items related to fertility statistically reflect the single latent construct, Fertility Awareness. Prior versions of these items in this scale were administered in the Karamoja region of Uganda and nationally in Rwanda. Learning from those projects informed the revision and administration of the final set of items administered in this study. Understanding the association between these items using a large sample of adolescent men and women in Nepal will provide programmatic guidance for the administration of Social Behavior Change Communication activities and counseling interventions. It will also provide guidance for program planners for use in evaluations.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>With the aim of developing and testing an FA scale, we analyzed baseline data from a mixed-methods quasi-experimental evaluation of Pragati, a community-based intervention in Nepal that provides accurate fertility awareness information and engages community members in reflective dialog through a series of interactive games.  The Pragati games were launched in five districts in Nepal with a systematically representative household sample (n = 3745, 2430 women, 1215 men) between 15 and 25 years old. The survey was administered as part of a larger questionnaire in December, 2016 using mobile devices and secure data collection software.  Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) identified the factor structure, and Item Response Theory (IRT) described item difficulty and overall appropriateness of the scale. Scale scores were calculated (sum scores) and logistic regression tested associations between FA scores and demographic variables including: sex, age groups, castes, marital status, education level, current FP use, and intention to use FP in next 6 months. Results indicated that the two items associated with the fertile window constituted a unique factor. Thus, independent models were fitted for the two fertile window items and the other eight items. All items in the FA scale will be presented with their participant scores.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Scree plots and Eigen values presented the items as a two factor solution, rejecting our hypothesized single factor solution. The two factors consisted of an 8 item General Fertility Awareness (GFA) factor and a 2 item factor that asks about the specific time within the menstrual cycle when a woman can become pregnant (Fertile Window Scale, FWS). Item Characteristic Curves and Test Information Curves validated this finding by showing that the FWS items were the most difficult for participants to answer correctly and reflected a separate factor. Mean score comparisons for the general fertility awareness factor were significantly different for men (4.19) and women (3.44) (p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Understanding beneficiaries’ knowledge of fertility is a cornerstone for effective reproductive health programming and meeting people with correct information. The use of CFA and IRT provide statistically rigorous methodologies through which to assess scales that often validates suspicions held by program implementers. In this study, these tests validated the need to treat questions about the fertile window separate from other indicators of FA. Although the FA items are valuable, their inclusion in a larger scale is detrimental. This presentation contributes to the field in two ways: 1) provides exemplary statistical scale validation procedures, which our field lacks, and 2) discusses fertility awareness as a concept within Nepal and using references from associated projects in two other African countries.</p>",

      "title": "An assessment of Women’s Empowerment and its linkages with use of Family Planning in India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>India is a country with rich culture and tradition, where women are renowned as Goddess. But at the same time the daily news portrays a different picture, where women are being mistreated and abused. The incidence of disrespecting women's rights on humanitarian ground exists not only outside but also inside the house. There are cases where women do not have accessibility or mobility to outside world; the most depressive being when they are not allowed to make a choice for their own health issues, which affects their reproductive health miserably. While discussing about women’s empowerment and its linkages with utilization of the family planning methods, it can be seen that in India, empowerment of women has been highlighted under National Mission for Empowerment of Women recently in 2010. On the other hand, the health perspective of women in terms of Reproductive Rights has been highlighted since International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 1994. The Programme of Action (POA) of ICPD-1994 was remarkable in its recognition that use of contraceptives, reproductive health and rights as well as women's empowerment and gender equality are the corner stone of population and development programmes having bearing on women's right to life and health.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The major research question to be addressed in this paper is how the recent swing of empowerment has influenced the uptake of family planning method, as a means to improve health and wellbeing of women. In this study using six dimension of women’s empowerment we hypothesize that women who have better empowerment are more likely to use family planning methods, compared with other women. In order to address the research question and test the hypothesis, this paper envisages the relationship between the recent waves of women's empowerment and use of family planning methods in India and its major states.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The basic data used in this paper has been taken from two rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS), conducted in 2005-2006 and 2015-2016. Both these surveys have been conducted under the stewardship of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare: Government of India. The International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai has been designated as the nodal agency for different rounds of NFHS. The information on different dimensions of women’s empowerment have been collected in state module only from approximately 122,351 women ages 15-49, living across 29 States  and 7 Union Territories of India. To assess the inequality in women’s empowerment, Liberson’s Diversity Index has been used for some selected dimensions of women' empowerment. However, contraceptive use has been analyzed by taking method mix in contraception as well as clubbing them in four major groups.   Multiple regression analysis has been used to portray the relationship between diversity in women's empowerment and use of family planning methods. Further, logistic regression model portray the adjusted effects of various dimensions of women's empowerment on use of contraception.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>This study has highlighted key issues of womens empowerment, its diversified nature and utilization of family planing methods in India. The level of diversity in women’s empowerment is not uniform across the states of India. Smaller states are high in achieveing equity in terms of women’s empowerment because of its homogeneous nature as against larger states. Varying degrees of equity across all the states builds a combative relationship with uptake of family planning methods. Regardless of the recent wave of women’s empowerment, the acceptance and utilization of family planning methods have not been enhanced except in 5 states. The use of any modern method of contraception has remained almost unchanged during last one decade. Age, wealth quintile, participation in household decision is significantly associated with use of family planning methods. Though use of modern method is high among women above 40 years age, the common method used is female sterilization. Results portray that women with no education or primary education are higher to use female sterilization. The reason behind the high use of modern spacing method may be because of higher education as well as development of information. The participation in household decision making and owning of bank account contributes in the decision making of their own health as they are more likely to use family planning methods. The ICPD, 1994 also suggests that women who are more empowered have at least a say on their health care, but women who do not have decision making power are more vulnerable.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The study concludes that the uptake of family planning methods has remained unchanged despite of increase in the level of empowerment of women on various grounds yet the patriarchal norms influence the decision of using family planning and choice of family planning methods. But on the fact that the unmet need and teenage pregnancy are reducing and people are moving towards modern contraception instead of old permanent methods shows an improvement in women’s health. In most of the states in India, a huge gap has been found between women with 10 or more years of schooling and utilization of contraceptive method. Further, household decision making has not made a profound impact on the uptake of any family planning methods, except for some states. Household decision does not include individual level decisions and hence has not translated into decisions of one’s health. Women’s lack of power restricts their ability to make decisions about family planning practices. Further, though women’s financial empowerment is found through their ownership of household assets and their working status in last 12 months but that does not denote the women are working in an organized sector. The gender discrimination should also address on the educational ground which will ameliorate women’s power on their reproductive rights. Further, the diversity of empowerment should be reduced and equity should be attained to achieve the sole empowerment which gives full right to women for choices to decide the time and number of births she is ready to deliver.</p>",

      "title": "Closing the gender data gap on norms and values for improving family planning: development and piloting of a new module of the World Values Survey",
      "significanceBackground": "<p><strong>The </strong>World Values Survey<strong> (WVS) </strong>is a multi-disciplinary global network that has collected global data on values and social norms since 1981. The database covers 100 countries that host over 90% of the world’s population. In each country, a statistically representative sample of participants is surveyed face-to-face in partnership with local organizations. The data are freely available online, with over 25 million downloads across the world since 1981. While the WVS includes about 300 questions on a wide range of topics (e.g. social capital, health, security, poverty, democracy and migration), few questions tap into gender norms as related to family planning (FP) and other aspects of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Such data are critical in order to understand the intrinsic reasons behind family planning decision-making and related health outcomes (e.g. unintended and pregnancy and early childbearing). Agenda 2030 clearly identifies gender inequality as a major obstacle to global development - specifically in goal 5 dedicated to gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. To effectively monitor the progress towards Agenda 2030, better and nationally representative data on gender-related norms and values are however needed. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>We (WVS and researchers at Karolinska Institutet) developed a new module that expands the survey to collect nationally representative data on gender norms related to SRHR, including FP. This new module was piloted in one of the world’s most gender inequitable countries -  Nigeria - as part of the most recent WVS wave (#7), with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  The module includes 40 questions focused on gender norms related to FP decision-making such as women’s and men’s self-reported level of freedom and choice over FP and their confidence in their local health care provider regarding FP.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The pilot was conducted in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country. This is the fifth time the WVS is conducted in Nigeria, making it possible to create unique time-series of the development of values and social norms. Using representative samples from the censuses reflecting all ADM2 regions, 1,200 respondents were interviewed across 120 different locations in February 2018. The data have been cleaned and weighted and the analyses are ongoing. GPS-based technology enables thorough analyses of regions and communities within them. By using this methodology, it is possible to compare smaller communities with high levels of women's empowerment within larger areas where the empowerment is generally low. Multiple factor analyses and regressions will be used to explain the importance of various  sociodemographic background factors, both individually and on an aggregated level. Correlations between women's empowerment regarding family planning and perceived overall health and well-being will also be explored. Following the pilot in Nigeria, our goal is to implement the new module in other WVS countries globally.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary findings indicate a regional pattern in gender norms related to family planning in Nigeria, with men generally deciding on these issues in the north in contrast to a more gender-equal decision-making in the rest of the country. This pattern largely corresponds to the difference in religion between the north and south. Women alone, however, rarely decide. Examples of responses that follow this pattern include who decides over household expenses, health care visits and spending, care for children, visits to family and relatives, whether girls should go to school, when girls should marry, whether and when to have children, number of children, whether and when to have sex, and whether girls should be circumcised. In contrast, most respondents of both genders agree that girls and women should themselves decide whether, when and with whom they should marry. Most participants also indicate that girls should wait to marry until they have completed secondary school. Yet, most participants of both genders in the northern parts of the country respond that a girl is ready for marriage once she starts menstruating. In the northern, central and southwestern areas of Nigeria, most respondents report that a girl should honor the wishes of her parents if they want her to marry even if she disagrees herself. There are, however, pockets of deviating patterns within some communities. Additional findings, including which factors might contribute to regional differences, and the development of best practices, will be shared at the conference when all analyses will be finalized.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The current project has a number of implications for family planning programs. First,</p><p>our data can help identify the most critical gender-related social norms that drive family planning use and other sexual and reproductive health outcomes, and contribute new knowledge on trends and variation in women’s perceived empowerment and decision- making related to family planning. By doing so, it can help inform the design of targeted interventions that aim to address and transform harmful gender norms and empower women. Beyond improving the sexual and reproductive health of the general population (both in Nigeria and other countries), intended beneficiaries include civil-society organizations, policy makers and other relevant stakeholders and funders. Finally, because the WVS survey is carried out globally in over 50 countries in each wave on a regular basis, allowing comparisons at a global, national and regional levels, it has the possibility to fill a much-needed gap. With this new module on gender norms related to family planning and decision-making, the WVS can bridge the Demographic Health Surveillance (that mainly focuses on collecting data on SRH outcomes) and smaller surveys that has a stronger focus on gender-norms, thereby contributing valuable information to monitor the progress towards Agenda 2030.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Despite the several policies that have been enacted in support for reproductive health and family planning, and the seemingly high level of commitment towards promoting family planning in Uganda,for instance the London Summit commitments to increase funding towards family planning, the social, cultural and religious values have a strong influence on the reproductive health choices for Ugandans. Most cultures support early and frequent childbearing, large family sizes and, positioning of men as decision makers for their families, including the reproductive health of the women. This, to a large extent has an implication on the level of family planning uptake among the women despite the reduction of fertility rate from 6.2 to 5.7 children per woman, the fertility rate remains high given the limited resources.</p><p></p><p>Family planning as an effective strategy for reducing maternal mortality, unintended pregnancies enables women and families to have the number of children that they can adequately care for. By reducing unintended pregnancies, the number of unsafe abortions is reduced, hence reduction in maternal mortality rate.</p>",

      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The women are empowered and confident to engage key decision-makers to bring about changes regarding increased access to quality family planning services.</p><p>The double pressure approach has contributed to the increased demand for family planning services in the communities.

The A360 approach, which places youth in partnership with a transdisciplinary consortium of experts emphasizes rights-based, meaningful youth engagement that sees girls as decision-makers, and leaders. Findings from formative research carried out in iterative research and design phases in 2016-17 sought to understand the lives of adolescents in Northern Nigeria and revealed that in general, adolescent girls want to finish school, learn a trade, get married and then have children. Parents also see this as ideal, but believe early marriage protects girls’ moral standing. After marriage, girls desire empowerment to achieve the future they envision for themselves and their families, but currently lack what to make this a reality. An opportunity area where girls become informed and empowered, while fostering a trusted support system to ensure their access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services throughout relevant moments in their life journeys, was identified for design. This transformed into a mentorship program designed to create a place where married girls can be empowered to freely access SRH services and gain vocational skills.</p>",

The mentorship program included discussions around negotiation skills on SRH, conflict management, financial management, vocational skills, and women’s health. The intervention, implemented at a primary health care facility in Kaduna State, Northern Nigeria, tested the hypothesis that if skills of girls are built on life, family and health, while linking contraceptive as a tool that can empower them to achieve the vision they envision, will lead to increase adoption.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In Kaduna State (Northern Nigeria), to test the mentorship program, which focused on married adolescent, four young women within the age range of 25 – 30 years from the community were identified, and elected to become mentors. These women were taken through a three-day training using an abridged “young women support group’” training manual on selected topics around life, family, and health.</p><p>Each trained mentor earlier selected and deployed had to recruit a group of 8–12 married adolescent girls (15–19 years) and mentor. The mentor engaged with married girls using a discussion guide on different topics that will empower the girl and take them through 4 touch points including a vocational skills training. Topics discussed included personal and home hygiene, nutrition, relationship management, financial management, negotiation skills, HIV / STIs, contraception. The mentors meet with the girls for 2-3 hours, twice a week for 2 weeks (based on a joint agreement), afterward the empowered girls are graduated. After graduation, new set of girls are recruited and taken through the same process and the cycle repeated. The primary health centre is usually the agreed venue for the mentorship program to facilitate seamless access to SRH services.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The mentorship program was set up to run for six weeks in the implementing community. A total of 794 adolescent girls were mobilized but only 785 girls (497-married; 288-unmarried) turned up for the mentorship program, with 52.6% of the total girls that turned up for mentorship taking up different methods of contraception. Out of the 413 girls that took up a method, 74.1% were married.</p><p>The mentorship program revealed an increase in adoption of contraception at the facility, when discussions on benefits of modern contraception was linked to all topics discussed on life, family and health, thus positioning contraception as something that is relevant to the girl. Contraception was positioned as a tool for financial planning and stability, to be used to achieve financial independence and support the family.</p><p>A number of girls exposed to the intervention claimed to have already began small scale businesses when evaluation was carried out. There was also support from the male partners of girls who had been engaged through the program by male interpersonal communication agents (IPC Agents) in the community and saw the impact of these activities in their wives attitude in managing the home and family.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>A mentorship program that happens within the primary healthcare facility and integrates SRH information and services as well as skill building activities could be used as a major draw for married girls and their influencers. Evaluation of the program, revealed that the girls were eager to learn life skills and understand the relevance of contraception, while also dispelling myths and misconceptions around contraception. These girls expressed joy hearing about contraceptives during the program and its benefits and so were more receptive to adopting modern contraceptive methods.</p><p>As a beneficiary of the program, girls who go through the mentorship program and benefited from the intervention, were excited to inform their peers, which could be used as a future programming using the strategy for peer to peer referral. The vocational skills introduced to the mentorship program, appealed to the male partners who were also engaged through IPC sessions and feedback from the girls interviewed revealed that such husbands did not mind their wives going to the PHCs to learn skills on life, family and health and also take up contraception.</p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Many people face barriers realizing the right to freely decide one’s reproductive intentions. One indication is the 214 million women who want to prevent, delay, or discontinue having children but are not using contraception. A promising approach to achieve global family planning goals is results-based financing (RBF), a financial incentive mechanism to expand access and provision of health services. RBF is a strategy of the Global Financing Facility in Support of Every Woman Every Child (GFF), a partnership for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health in LMICs. </p><p>There is momentum for RBF and FP services to be guided by, promote, and protect rights-principles. A rights-based approach to FP uses a set of standards and principles to guide program assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation that enables individuals and couples to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children, to have the information and services to do so, and to be treated equitably and free of discrimination. FP services within RBF are often supported by incentives for enrolling new users or increasing clinic visits, with less attention to client-focused metrics. RBF programs could strengthen client-centered healthcare through incentives that promote quality, informed choice, and voluntarism, among other rights. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Given the potential benefits of RBF to expand access to and quality of family planning and the global resolve to utilize rights-based approaches in developing health programs, the study analyzed country-produced RBF implementation manuals for the extent to which RBF program designs are rooted in rights principles. The paper presents an assessment of whether quality, informed choice, and voluntarism – guiding principles for family planning programs – in addition to other principles informed by international rights treaties, are accounted for in RBF operational and performance measures. The review also identifies gaps where improved client-centered approaches could strengthen RBF programs.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Evidence Project Team performed a scoping review to find and analyze RBF operation and implementation manuals found through web searches and consultations with experts. 23 relevant documents from 23 countries in Latin America, sub-Sahara Africa and central Asia, published in English and French from 2009-2015 were identified for full review. From each document, concepts, procedures, and performance measures that specify or reflect rights and rights principles were extracted, and pertinent gaps were identified pertinent gaps. The rights principles assessed are: acceptability, accessibility, accountability, availability, equity, informed choice, quality, and voluntarism. While the paper focuses on FP-related RBF elements, the extracted data was not exclusively focused on FP-specific elements in the documents. For example, the availability of commodities is not necessarily specific to contraceptives, but potentially inclusive of them. Information from the documents was sorted by the eight principles, or groupings of, per country, with an additional section for relevant but miscellaneous findings.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Overall, RBF protocols of many countries imply an acknowledgement of rights principles but the explicit support and operationalization of rights principles generally is not written into RBF implementation. RBF operations documents do not explicitly or deliberately use a rights-based approach in program design and implementation.</p><p>Regarding voluntarism, informed choice, and quality, results were mixed. There is much overlap in how RBF programs define and measure quality and other principles, most notably accessibility, acceptability, and availability. Quality is often explicitly built into program operations through quality checklists and performance metrics.  Across the operational manuals, dimensions of quality are captured in performance and quality measures, rewards, and verification procedures.</p><p>In terms of informed choice, there are performance and quality measures, as well as verification procedures, that assess and reward whether and how much information is shared. Only the program in Tanzania attempted to assess if information is understood by consumers. Additionally, while there was discussion of autonomy in terms of RBF programs giving more agency to health service actors at points of service, there was no discussion of client agency of autonomy in any of the reviewed RBF operational documents. The distinction is an important point to make in discussing how RBF protects consumer rights.</p><p>The review also uncovered a focus on supply over demand, a lack of downward accountability to health care consumers, an absence of agency, and an incomplete conception of quality in the RBF implementation manuals.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Given its centrality to RMNCAH funding through the GFF, RBF for family planning services will have significant implications on the abilities of women to choose if, when, and how many children to bear in their lifetimes. Placing consumers at the center of services and ensuring that they are always prioritized and protected when designing, planning, and implementing RBF programs is critical to ensuring that people can make their own family planning decisions and to sustaining RBF programs, particularly those supported by the GFF. The review demonstrates a need for updated global and national guidance around RBF design and implementation. Rights principles should provide a foundation for RBF programming. With this and clarity on how to measure and define rights in health financing programs, RBF implementation can be critically strengthened.</p><p>The review uncovered some important questions. Are the ways in which the manuals address the included principles related to rights-based programming adequate? Do the manuals demonstrate expectations for a rights-based approach to health care? How can the principles be incorporated into implementation and be documented, accounted for, and rewarded? The intersection of rights-based family planning and supplementary financial remuneration for health care raises concerns about the suitability and fit of RBF for family planning programs. There is great potential for perverse incentivizing or adverse effects to RBF programming. A rights-based approach to RBF design and implementation, to bolster the rights-based family planning approach supported by Family Planning 2020 and other initiatives and agencies, would keep patient-centered care in the fore. </p>",

      "title": "Social normative and social network factors associated with family planning and fertility decisions among married adolescent girls and their husbands in rural Niger. ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>While it is well known that Niger has one of the highest fertility rates in the world, contextual factors that contribute to that rate, including the role of social norms and social networks, are relatively unexplored. Clearly high fertility in rural Niger is normative, but in what way? Norms can be established through common practices which are acceptable but not socially reinforced, or they may be socially reinforced through social influence with a threat of sanctions for non-compliance. Social influence works through social networks, with different groups of people having a differential impact on behavior depending upon the individual.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In this study we use an innovative social network analysis approach to consider what is the role of social networks in the fertility decisions of married adolescents and their husbands? Is high fertility simply “acceptable”, in other words simply a common practice, or is it reinforced through social expectations? Who are the people who are the most influential in a young couple’s fertility decisions, what are their relationships to the couple, and their individual characteristics? Finally are couples correct in their assumptions regarding what the people in their networks believe and expect?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>As part of Pathfinder International’s <em>Reaching Married Adolescents</em> project, data were collected from married adolescent girls (ages 13-19) and their husbands across three rural districts in the Dosso region (N=1076 dyads). Adolescent wives and their husbands were asked how many children they have, whether they have ever used family planning, their intentions to use family planning, preferences towards spacing births and their fertility preferences. Both wives and husbands were then asked about their normative beliefs about age at first birth, spacing of births, and family planning use, as well as their own personal attitudes towards these practices. Normative beliefs included what is the common practice, as well as what people in the community approve of regarding these practices. Individuals were also asked regarding their beliefs around gender roles.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p> As part of the larger survey effort, a subset of wives and husbands were given a separate social networks module, in which they were asked to identify people with whom they discuss personal matters, matters related to family and fertility, and people who are involved with decisions around fertility. They then rated each individual named according to how influential they are in their lives. The individual named as most influential for each respondent participating in the network module was identified and surveyed. The survey given to the most influential social contact included questions similar to those asked of husbands and wives, including social network questions.</p><p>Results of this analysis will provide us with rich contextual information regarding the normative influence on young couples through social network pathways. We will be able to identify who respondents name as being most influential; assess how similar individuals are with this most influential individual on norm, attitudes, and decisions regarding fertility; the nature of the relationships; and who encompasses the larger network.  Initial results from our ethnographic social network data suggest that 1.) men identify more people who are involved in family decision and decisions around fertility than women do, and 2.) while women mostly nominate husbands as important in family decisions, men nominate a range of people including brothers, aunts, mothers, friends and fathers.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Understanding the key influencers and decision makers around fertility and family planning decisions can help guide interventions that address social contextual factors, rather than simply focusing on individuals. Results from this study will provide guidance for interventions that can use more precise strategies for achieving normative change based upon an understanding of where in the community normative influences are coming, how concordant the beliefs of the people in the communities are, and where might be the greatest opportunity for change.</p>",

      "title": "Women empowerment and contraceptive use in peri-urban Kumasi, Ghana",
      "significanceBackground": "The SDG-5 seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Empowering women is a cornerstone of development because it helps build healthier, better educated and, more peaceful and prosperous societies. Satisfactory progress could be made in increasing contraceptive uptake if empowerment of women is not ignored. Empowering women gives them the ability to make decisions about their body and their reproductive health, and make better use of reproductive health and family planning information and services that enable them achieve their desired family size and fertility preferences. Contraceptive uptake in Ghana has not been as impressive as desired. Many reasons have been used to explain the context in which contraceptive uptake occurs in Ghana. One area that has not received enough attention is that of women empowerment and contraceptive uptake. Although Ghana has pushed for and made significant progress towards achieving gender equity in both education and employment, these have not been linked with an improvement in women's autonomy and uptake of contraception in Ghana. A better understanding of how women empowerment influences contraceptive uptake will provide additional impetus to efforts to improve contraceptive uptake in Ghana in order to reap the economic and health benefits of contraception.",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "Does the level of empowerment of women influence contraceptive uptake among women in peri-urban Kumasi? Which dimensions of women empowerment influence contraceptive uptake among women in peri-urban Kumasi? The relationship between current and future contraceptive use and three categories of empowerment such as economic security and contribution to family, freedom from family domination and mobility was examined using logistic regression technique in this study.",
      "methodology": "Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana has a cosmopolitan outlook. It has an estimated population of 2,204,395 with a growth rate of 2.7%. There are 213 communities in Kumasi. As with other large cities in developing countries, Kumasi has a sprawling peri-urban setting where availability of social amenities is reported to be a challenge. The study was conducted in Asawase - 761 currently married or cohabiting women aged 15-49 years who were residents of the study area for at least two years and consented to be part of the study were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The women were randomly sampled from each of the systematically selected and labelled households/structures used in the Family Health and Wealth Study (FHWS), a longitudinal open-cohort study looking at the relationship between family size, health wealth, and which has been on-going since 2009. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to link the exposure variables: the three measures of empowerment and other variables such as age, marital status, religion, education, ethnicity, income and number of living children with the outcome variable (current or future contraceptive use). Excel was used for data entry and STATA for analyses. A p-value≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "Majority (62%) of the respondents were below 35years (mean age 34.2). Three-in-four (75%) women were married. Forty-six percent were using contraceptives and 54% intended to use contraceptives in future. The injectable and pills were preferred among the current users (22.5%) and future users (39.3%). Socio-demographic characteristics such as marital status (aOR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.29-3.27, p=0.002), ethnicity (aOR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28-0.93, p=0.029) and parity (aOR 2.33, 95% CI: 0. 1.31,4.14, p=0.004) remained significant predictors of current or future contraceptive use after multivariate analysis. Twenty-nine percent of the respondents were empowered in all the three categories used to measure empowerment in this study, 34% were empowered in two out of the three categories, 29% were empowered in only one category while 9% of the women were not empowered in any of the categories. Age, marital status, religion, income and number of living children (p-value=0.001) were seen to be significantly associated with economic security and contribution empowerment. Concerning freedom from family domination empowerment, education level and level of income played a statistically significant role (p-value=0.001). Marital status (p=0.049) was the only socio-demographic characteristic that played a marginally statistically significant role in the women's mobility empowerment.In a bivariate analysis by means of Pearson's chi-square to investigate the association between the level of empowerment among the study population and contraceptive use, economic security and contribution empowerment (p-value=0.001) was the only category seen to be significantly associated with contraceptive use.",
      "knowledgeContribution": "Family planning programmers should design specific programs, which take into consideration the health needs of peri-urban women and aim at improving their economic status in peri-urban Kumasi. Majority of the women had future contraceptive use intension implies that innovative ways are required to bridge the gap between the current and future users. Family planning services at the doorstep of the community combined with health education that emphasizes the wealth and health benefits of family planning could encourage uptake. The economic empowerment of women has been considered these days as a sign of advancement for a country; as a result, the issue of economic empowerment of women is necessary and of great importance to political leaders, Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Community Based Organizations (CBOs), social scientists and reformers. NGOs and political authorities should provide economic interventions to empower and uplift conditions of women needed to bring change in the economic status of their families and remove their dependence upon their families. Through this support, women in peri-urban Kumasi would become economically independent in making contraceptive choices and decisions, which would help in the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals: One (to end poverty in all its forms everywhere) and Five (to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls).",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>There are 700,000 garment factory workers in Cambodia, 85% of whom are women. These factory workers are mostly young internal migrants, with low levels of awareness on sexual and reproductive health, rights, and services. While half of workers report being sexually active, less than a third of them are using modern methods of contraception. Unable to make informed decisions and fully exercise their rights to reproductive health information and services, these factory workers are particularly vulnerable to unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion. As a result, many female factory workers must take time off work, earn less income, and face increased expenses, thus contributing to a ‘poverty trap’ situation. For factories, this means an unstable workforce and lower productivity and for brands and retailers, a higher business risk. While many interventions seek to meet the family planning needs of female garment workers, most are funding dependent, small scale, and address basic awareness. These interventions often fail to result in actual behavior change, and hence have limited impact.  Given the pressures of productivity and limitations on time, innovative approaches are needed to ensure that garment workers are being reached with critical reproductive health services and information, where they are most of the</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>CARE is empowering factory workers through <em>Chat!</em>, an innovative behavior change package that addresses sexual and reproductive health through a <em>teach</em>, <em>engage</em>, and <em>challenge</em> model: (1) Short, activity-based sessions that cover communication and consent, contraception, STIs, and safe abortion in a comfortable space; (2) Video dramas featuring characters in a garment factory to engage workers’ emotions as they relate to their everyday challenges; and (3) an interactive mobile application that challenges workers to improve their understanding of key topics. Facilitators are armed with relevant knowledge to correct misconceptions, and a referral directory with options for quality services near the factories.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p><em>Chat!</em> has been implemented in 35 garment and footwear factories in Phnom Penh and Kandal, Cambodia over two years (November 2015-present), reaching 27,703 female factory workers to date. A quantitative assessment was conducted in December 2016-January 2017 in three factories with 244 workers (95% of confidence level and 6% margin error) and numbers were compared with the baseline assessment in four factories with 909 workers in August 2014. Workers of reproductive age (18-49 years of age) were selected from lists of workers supplied by the factories, using random number generation, with proportional numbers for each factory. Additional business level indicators were collected by self-report from management, including leave without notice and turnover including 2015 (before the intervention) and 2016 (during/after the intervention). </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Compared with baseline, use of modern contraception among sexually active women garment factory workers doubled from 24.2% (in 2014) to 48% (in 2016). Utilization of sexual and reproductive health services reached 20% compared to 8.6% at baseline. In terms for empowerment and self-efficacy, complete confidence to discuss contraception with partners reached 50% compared to 24.4% at baseline and complete confidence to refuse sex with partners reached 50% from 16.8% at baseline. Knowledge of abortion also increased, with 47% knowing abortion was legal in the baseline compared to 7.9% at baseline. Both knowledge and behavior indicators were significantly higher among those participating in multiple elements of the intervention, compared to just one. In terms of business indicators, factories saw 6% less turnover, 24% less leave without permission, and 6% more workers reaching productivity targets. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p><em>Chat!</em> demonstrates that behavior change approaches that integrate multiple forms of media and technology are able to reach garment workers with sexual and reproductive health information and services and actually empower them to make healthy decisions. In addition to providing knowledge and raising awareness, interventions should address underlying issues of confidence and self-efficacy, which often requires more time and resources. This is particularly difficult in workplace settings where productivity is a priority. When working with brands and factories, understanding the economic indicators they will monitor at the outset and including them in monitoring and evaluation is important.  The data from <em>Chat! </em>supports the idea that when workers have access to reliable, critical reproductive health information and services, they are able to plan their families and their lives, thus becoming more productive employees. With the ability to exercise their right to reproductive health, female garment workers can make a sustainable impact on the workforce of their countries, contributing to economic returns and pushing overall development.  In the simplest sense, happy, healthy workers, make better, more productive employees, who lead more fulfilling lives.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In 2011, the Ouagadougou Partnership stakeholders in francophone West Africa committed to reaching 1 million additional family planning (FP) users by 2015. In 2015, a new commitment was set to reaching 2.2 million additional users by 2020. Moreover, at the 2012 London FP Summit, the global community committed to reaching 120 million additional FP users in the 69 poorest countries by 2020. In 2017, these efforts helped reach 38.8 million additional users, according to FP2020 and UNFPA data. Nonetheless, the Demographic and Health Surveys in francophone West Africa show that modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR) remain low (7–17%) and unmet need high (16–34%).</p><p>To accelerate the Ouagadougou Partnership and FP2020 commitments’ achievement, USAID/West Africa awarded the AgirPF project to EngenderHealth. AgirPF aims to increase access to and use of quality FP services in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritania, Niger, and Togo. In Mauritania, despite routinely free FP services, the mCPR is 15.6% among married women. Thus, ensuring access to quality FP service is a key part of national efforts to reduce high maternal mortality (602 deaths per 100,000 live births). Therefore, AgirPF implemented a set of high-impact practices, including FP Special Days (FPSDs), to help increase FP use.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>An FPSD is a two-phase, five-day event organized at a health facility in collaboration with the community to provide free FP services to increase access and utilization. The first phase consists of a three-day community mobilization activity using community workers, community radio stations, and traditional announcers. The second phase is a three-day free provision of quality FP services: educational talks on FP, counseling, and offering of the full range of FP methods. The two phases, which overlap, require extensive logistics, including allocation of additional providers and tight supervision to ensure that all methods are offered and international quality standards met.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Between February and September 2017, AgirPF conducted 107 FPSD events in 38 HFs in the capital city of Nouakchott.</p><p>The FPSD event requires community health workers for information dissemination, as well as additional providers from the District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) and neighboring facilities to support FP service provision, due to high client load during FPSDs, and to coach the host-facility providers as needed. </p><p>FPSD data are recorded in the same data collection tools used in routine services (educational talk register, FP register, client forms), but with a different ink color. Information collected includes client demographics, service/method offered, and number of clients participating in FP educational talks. A separate form is used to record the numbers of individuals reached by the events’ community mobilization activities. The FPSD and routine FP services data are collated monthly in a report form and entered in the AgirPF DHIS2 database.</p><p>This paper analyses the number of people sensitized during FPSD community mobilization and compares the services data from FPSDs to the routine services data from the same sites on the number of days of service delivery, number of clients served by type, number of couple-years of protection (CYPs) provided, and method mix.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The 107 FPSD events organized in 38 HFs from February to September 2017 lasted a total of 324 days, representing 5% of the total number of working days over the period for all the HFs combined. Yet, 22% of the FP users at the HFs during the period were served during FPSD, including 30% of new users and 34% of those adopting long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), which contributed to 28% of total CYPs.</p><p>The average daily performance of the FPSDs was far higher than in routine services:</p><ul>\t<li>4.9 times more continuing users served;</li>\t<li>8.4 times more new clients served;</li>\t<li>10.5 times more clients opting for a LARC; and</li>\t<li>7.7 times more CYPs.</li></ul><p>The FPSDs offered the full range of FP methods available in Mauritania, including LARCs, which are routinely provided at very few HFs. As a result, the method mix during FPSD is more skewed toward LARCs than are routine services; the percentage of new clients adopting LARCs is twice as high during FPSDs (21%) than in routine services (12%). However, short-acting methods remain by far the most widely used during both FPSD (79%) and in routine services (88%).</p><p>The FPSD community mobilization activities reached a large number of individuals with FP messages: 83,184 people through door-to-door visits and 12,063 people through FP educational talks.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The FPSDs achieved outstanding results compared with routine services, in terms of number and types of clients served, number of CYPs gained, and method mix. The experience provides valuable guidance and many lessons learned for future FP programs to build upon:</p><ul>\t<li>At the facility level, specific days should be dedicated to the provision of free FP services, as this is an effective approach to increase access to and use of FP services.</li>\t<li>The public-to-public coaching model experienced by AgirPF during the FPSDs appears to have contributed to an increase in LARC service provision at host sites during FPSDs, especially among new providers, whose capacity was strengthened.</li>\t<li>A way to optimize client turnout during FPSDs is to improve coordination and communication between local health facilities, the DHMTs, and service providers, which will in turn improve site selection and demand generation activities.</li>\t<li>This approach also offers a promising way to meet unmet need for FP in underserved communities.</li>\t<li>The FPSD is an important health systems strengthening approach that can be scaled up in areas with limited service accessibility, particularly in hard-to-reach communities.</li>\t<li>Lastly, FPSD is a sound approach to reduce inequities in access to FP services by allowing for flexible and strategic deployment of human and material resources, FP commodities, and supplies.</li></ul>",

      "title": "Integrating Postpartum Contraceptive Counseling and IUD Insertion Services into Maternity Care in Nepal: Results from Stepped-Wedge Randomized Trial",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Nepal, contraceptive prevalence among married women aged 16-49 years increased from 19% to 53% between 1990 and 2016, and while the unmet need for family planning decreased from 34% to 24% over the same period, concerted efforts are still needed to increase access, especially in the postpartum period. Only 9% of women are counseled on family planning during their postpartum period in Nepal, and 54% have an unmet need for family planning within the two years following a birth. Provision of a long-acting and reversible contraceptive method at the time of birth in health facilities could be appealing to women who want to space or limit their births. This paper examines the impact of an intervention that provided ante-natal family planning counseling and postpartum IUD (PPIUD) insertion services in six hospitals, with the intent to eventually integrate PPIUD counseling and insertion services as part of routine maternity care in Nepal. The intervention used a step-wedge randomized rollout across the six hospitals giving us high quality data on the impact of the program. Success of the intervention could strengthen the case for expanding the program throughout Nepal. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The program provided training to health care providers on postpartum family planning counseling dring the ante-natal period and PPIUD insertion immediately following delivery. It was designed by the International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (FIGO) and the Nepal Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (NESOG).  This study was designed as an impact evaluation using a randomized rollout of the intervention at a hospital level to estimate the effect on counselling rates, the quality of counselling, and PPIUD uptake. We hypothesize that the intervention had a significant impact on being counselled and on PPIUD uptake. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study took place in six large tertiary hospitals in Nepal.  All women who gave birth in these six hospitals in the 18-month period between September 2015 and March 2017 were asked to participate giving a sample of 75,587 women  (99.6%  consent rate) who were interviewed after delivery and before discharge from hospital. We use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design with randomization of the intervention timing at the hospital level. The data collection began prior to the intervention in all hospitals to give a pre-intervention baseline and the intervention was introduced into the hospitals in two steps, with three hospitals implementing in each step with six month interval between steps.    The differential timing of the intervention across hospitals allows us to identify the effect of the intervention separately from pure time effects. We estimate the overall effect using a linear regression with a wild bootstrap to estimate valid standard errors given the cluster randomized design. Not all woman were counselled during the intervention period and we estimate the effect of being counselled on treatment using the intervention as an instrumental variable. We also undertake an analysis of how the quality of counselling affected PPIUD uptake, </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Our Intent-to-Treat analysis shows that being exposed to the intervention increased PPIUD counselling among women by 25 percentage points (pp) [95% CI: 14 – 40 pp], and the proportion of women taking up PPIUD by four percentage points [95% CI: 3 – 6 pp]. Women who expressed a desire to limit or space their future pregnancies were more likely to take up PPIUD. Both groups of hospitals show a ramp up of counselling rates and PPIUD uptake over a few months at the start of the intervention and a stable level thereafter. There is substantial variation in counselling rates between different groups of women which may reflect differential access to hospital based ante natal services. The intervention focused on training in the hospital delivery wards and their antenatal care facilities and many women, particularly those living far from a hospital, may have had their ante-natal care elsewhere.  Our adherence adjusted estimate is that, on average, being counseled due to the program increased PPIUD uptake by about 17 percentage points [95% CI: 14-40 pp]. Among those counselled 50% reported the opportunity to ask questions while only 26% could recall specific benefits or disadvantages of PPIUD. We find that those who received higher quality of counseling, in the form of having the opportunity to ask questions during counseling, and being able to remember benefits and disadvantages of PPIUD, were more likely to choose PPIUD. Our results suggest that providing high quality counseling and insertion services generates a demand for postpartum IUD services. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our results show that the intervention had a significant impact on increasing PPIUD counseling rates and PPIUD uptake among women in the six study hospitals. Only about a quarter of women in our sample received counseling in the intervention period. In addition, a substantial number of women were only counselled after admission to the hospital for delivery, rather than in the ante-natal period.   Our adherence-adjusted estimates suggest that if counselling had covered all women in the sample PPIUD uptake would have increased by around 17 percentage points. Among women who were counseled, women who knew about benefits and disadvantages, or women who were given the opportunity to ask questions, were more likely to take up PPIUD.  Our results suggest that the program had a significant impact but could be improved, in particular by expanding the proportion of women counselled on PPIUD during ante-natal care, and by improving the quality of counselling. Increasing the proportion of women counselled may require a shift in emphasis to counselling during the ante-natal period in health centers providing ante natal care and not just in hospital ante-natal clinics.    </p>",

      "title": "Investigating the Impact of the Global Gag Rule on Sexual and Reproductive Health Services in Uganda ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In January 2017, the Trump Administration reinstated the Global Gag Rule (GGR), which makes non-U.S. NGOs ineligible for U.S. funding if they provide or promote access to abortion. This new policy represents an expansion over previous versions, as it covers most U.S. global health assistance (~$8.8 billion).</p><p>After the Bush-Era GGR was enacted, some work qualitatively investigated the effect of the policy at the organizational level and provided hypothesized mechanisms through which the policy could impact service delivery. Only two studies systematically evaluated the policy’s impact, finding that the policy was associated with elevated abortion rates in several countries, as well as reduced contraceptive services and increased unintended pregnancies in rural Ghana. In Uganda, anecdotal evidence indicated that the previous GGR was associated with decreases in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service delivery. However, no research quantitatively documented this reported impact in the country.</p><p>Due to its expanded scope, the newly reinstated GGR may result in larger and/or more diverse impacts than previously reported. In order to ensure the SRH needs of women and girls, rigorous, quantitative research is needed to understand the impact of the GGR on SRH delivery in Uganda.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Main research question: What is the impact of the expanded GGR on SRH service delivery in Uganda?</p><p>We hypothesize that the GGR will negatively impact SRH services through the following mechanisms: non-signing organizations will reduce direct service provision and technical support for public facilities; signing organizations will be more limited in their scope of services; and partnerships across family planning (FP) organizations will be disrupted, thereby reducing efficiency and service provision. However, we also anticipate that replacement funding, as well as organizational restructuring, may be working to mitigate or counteract the impact of the GGR since its reinstatement.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study uses a pre-post, quasi-experimental design. Data come from the 2014-2018 Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA) survey in Uganda, which includes a sample of FP service delivery points (SDPs) that service randomly selected enumeration areas. Approximately 380 SDPs (e.g., hospital, health center, pharmacy) are surveyed across the 10 sub-regions of Uganda in each of the six rounds.</p><p>The main dependent variable is exposure to the GGR. Using administrative data and other information collected from key FP organizations, districts in Uganda will be classified as either “more” or “less” exposed to the GGR. This analysis will focus on several outcome variables, including contraceptive method mix, FP commodity stock-outs, FP service integration, visits by mobile outreach teams, and provision of post abortion care (PAC).</p><p>For outcomes collected by PMA2020 since 2016, we will conduct an impact analysis using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach. Multivariable ANCOVA regression models will be estimated, which include the exposure variable, the outcome in the baseline period, the interaction of these two variables, and potential confounders. For outcomes added to the SDP survey in 2018 (PAC and HIV-service provision), we will look for associations between GGR exposure and the outcome using cross-sectional multivariable models that also control</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Baseline data from 2016 show the majority of sampled SDPs were located in rural areas (76%), and over half were government managed (61%). Across all types of SDPs, the some of the most common FP methods provided  were male condoms (92%), injectables (91%), implants (87%), and oral contraceptives (85%). Approximately 31% of facilities reported any FP stock-outs in the last 3 months, 67% reported visits by a mobile outreach team, and 65% reported offering FP services to HIV clients.</p><p>Based on information collected during mapping trips in April 2018, we anticipate that mobile outreach, contraception method mix, and PAC services and commodities may be most sensitive to change due to the reinstated GGR. While services of many prime grantees of U.S. funding are not being impacted, we learned that sub-grantees providing critical SRH technical assistance and services are either loosing funding or limiting services.</p><p>Data collection for round 6 of PMA2020 will be completed by June 2018, after which we will conduct impact analyses investigating outcomes that have been continuously collected (contraceptive method mix, FP commodity stock-outs, mobile outreach visits, and FP service integration), as well as descriptive analyses looking at associations between GGR exposure and the new indicators added to PMA2020 in 2018 (PAC provision, antiretroviral therapy drug stock-outs). All analyses will control for potential confounders, such as regional differences in key social determinants of health.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This paper, alongside a concurrent analysis in Ethiopia, will provide the first rigorous, quantitative assessment of the impact of the new, expanded GGR policy. Uganda is an important context in which to study the impact of this policy. Abortion is already largely restricted in the country. Therefore, implementation of the policy in this environment may further reduce access to abortion and PAC services to the most needy and vulnerable women in the country.</p><p>In addition, the PMA2020 platform includes a survey of women in Uganda. We hypothesized that any impacts of the GGR may take longer to manifest in women’s outcomes, and we plan to conduct a similar impact analysis using the 2018 and subsequent 2019 female questionnaire data. The results of this study will help to inform that work by providing insights into which services are changing as a result of the GGR policy.</p><p>Restrictions on what services organizations can provide or promote have the potential to impact a much larger range of critical SRH services. This analysis is critical to understanding whether the GGR is having negative, unintended effects on FP outcomes. The findings from this paper will also provide important contributions to the Ugandan government and other organizations working to ensure that the provision of comprehensive SRH services continue.</p>",

      "title": "The Effect of Improving Access to Family Planning on Contraceptive Use: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Malawi",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Improving access to family planning (FP) may help African women and couples to meet their desired fertility and to avert unintended pregnancies and unwanted births. Interventions that aim to influence family planning demand (sexual and reproductive health behavior change, informing women and couples about the benefits of family planning) and supply (improving access to contraceptives and family planning services) have become increasingly common in developing countries. However, few randomized control trials have been conducted to assess the causal impact of family planning in low-income countries, and even fewer impact evaluations have been conducted to determine the extent to which such family planning interventions may affect lifetime fertility, downstream health outcomes, and economic well-being. To date, not many impact evaluations have rigorously sought to identify family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) program effectiveness at the individual or household level, and apart from the frequently cited Matlab project and a recent study by Ashraf, Field et al. (2012), no randomized control trial to our knowledge has attempted to causally identify the impact of family planning and contraceptive adoption on both immediate and longer term outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. This gap has led to a debate in the field about the effectiveness of family planning.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This randomized controlled trial seeks to identify the causal impact of a family planning intervention on contraceptive use, knowledge and attitudes towards family planning, and longer-term outcomes related to fertility, maternal and child health (MCH), and measures of well-being. Short-term outcomes that have been measured to date include: knowledge of family planning, attitudes, changes in desired fertility, and contraceptive use. Intermediate and long-term outcomes, which will be measured in future surveys, include fertility outcomes (parity, birth spacing), unmet need for family planning, maternal and child health outcomes (child birth height and weight, nutritional status), women's labor force participation, and economic well-being.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study is a two-armed randomized control trial that consists of a baseline survey followed by implementation of our family planning intervention starting one month after completion of the baseline. Follow-up surveys are conducted one year (midline) and two years (endline) from the start of the intervention period, respectively. The study sample is 2,143 married women aged 18-35 who are either pregnant or up to 6 months postpartum at baseline in Lilongwe, Malawi.</p><p>As part of the trial, each woman in the study was randomly assigned to one of two experimental arms: an intervention arm or a control arm. A woman who was assigned to the intervention arm received a two-year long family planning intervention that included:</p>\t<li>a family planning information package and 6 private counseling visits;</li>\t<li>free transportation to a family planning clinic with low waiting times; and</li>\t<li>financial reimbursement for family planning services, including out of pocket expenditures related to family planning care and treatments that are received at the family planning clinic, and free consultations and referrals in the event that she experienced contraindications or side effects related to her use of family planning.</li><p>Our main econometric specifications estimate the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect of our family planning intervention on key outcomes.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 2,143 married women who were aged 18-35, living in Lilongwe, and were either pregnant or up to 6 months postpartum at the time of interview were recruited at baseline and were eligible to be randomized into either the three-component family planning intervention or the control group. The average age of women was 21.7 years, and women in the sample reported an average of 1.74 births at baseline. Baseline contraceptive use in our sample was high, with almost half (49.5 percent) of all women who were not pregnant reporting use of a family planning method at the time of the survey.</p><p>From this final sample, 1,026 women were randomly assigned to the family planning intervention group while the remaining 1,117 women were randomly assigned to the control group.</p><p>In our adjusted intent-to-treat analysis on data from our midline survey, which was completed in February 2018, we find that the women who were randomly assigned to the three-component family planning intervention arm had a 5.1 percentage point higher contraceptive prevalence rate after one year of being exposed to the intervention than women who were assigned to the control arm. We find the intent-to-treat effect of the family planning intervention to be larger for women who are more educated (6.2 percentage points). Findings from our second year follow-up survey in 2019 will allow us to examine longer-term outcomes of interest, including pregnancy and birth spacing, contraceptive (dis)continuation, long-run method mix, etc.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gaps on the effectiveness of family planning interventions by directly identifying the causal impact of an increase in access to family planning on contraceptive use and other related outcomes in a Sub-Saharan African context. Service providers and policy makers in Malawi will be able to use the findings from our study to improve the availability of and access to family planning and reproductive health services. More generally, our long-term findings may also provide evidence to suggest that the benefits of improving access to family planning are likely to extend beyond the health domain by also improving economic well-being and contributing to poverty alleviation. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services are a critical part of an adolescent’s development and yet they are often absent in many a young person’s journey from adolescence to adulthood. Adolescents and young people encounter a number of hindrances in exercising their right to SRH information and services. Unintended pregnancies, risky childbirth, unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV are some of the afflictions adolescents encounter. Furthermore, millions are denied the essential support they need to become knowledgeable, confident and skilled adults. Even those equipped with the right information may not access the health services they need to protect themselves. Law and policy are fertile grounds for the cultivation of rules that can provide a foundation for great changes including in availability and access to SRH information and services. It is thus important to identify new and emerging needs, develop and revise policies and guidelines to conform to global standards and respond to emerging needs. The ability to achieve healthy and empowered adolescents therefore hinges on a supportive legal and policy environment for adolescent access to SRH Services and Information. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study was based on the underlying assumption that:</p><p>If Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights policies are disseminated and implemented, an environment that promotes the realization of SRHR of Children, Adolescents and Young People will be created. Awareness of and understanding of the SRHR policies will foster policy implementation processes and contribute to the transformation of the health and welfare of adolescents. This study therefore sought to assess the level  of dissemination and understanding of national level policies on SRHR and existing by-laws</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study was conducted in two Sub counties (Kakiri, Gombe) in Wakiso District, Central Uganda. The study used a mixed-method approach: descriptive and analytical, employed both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. The study carried out between November 2017 and February 2018 was guided by the following objectives: identify national level policies and bye-laws on SRHR, establish the level of dissemination of national level policies and by-laws on SRHR, assess the level of understanding of national level policies and bye-laws on SRHR and assess the level of responsiveness of laws and policies to SRHR needs of children, adolescents and young people.</p><p>Purposive and convenient sampling methods were used to select respondents for study while document analysis and interviews were used to collect data. Geographical coverage and stakeholder representation were ensured across all study participants. </p><p>Key informants interviews were transcribed and translated into English verbatim and analyzed manually for key themes using standard coding and content analysis techniques. Data collection tools were checked for completeness and accuracy prior to data entry. Quantitative data was double entered and analyzed using Epi Info and STATA 11.   Data were summarized and displayed using means, medians, proportions, pie charts, and graphs.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Key findings of the study indicate that there is a legislative provision for the age of Consent to HIV testing and counseling, consensual sexual acts among adolescents are criminalized, limited awareness of policy objectives and actions; limited advocacy and availability of IEC about SRHR policy, misperceptions about the policies and inadequate or no performance information to guide decision making at national, district and facility levels among others. </p><p>Furthermore, respondents reported that policies such as the Prevention and Control of HIV Act presented implementation challenges because of the additional resource requirements.</p><p>Policies and procedures to ensure free or affordable service provision and data collection, analysis and use for quality improvement were deficient . Additionally, providers interviewed were not aware of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) including Referral SOPs, SOPs on informed consent, SOPs on providing services to all adolescents irrespective of their ability to pay, age, sex, marital status or other characteristics and SOP on measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of adolescents</p><p> </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Policy dissemination is an often neglected and under researched area in resource challenged settings. Findings from the study will inform the dissemination and implementation phase of policies in Uganda by emphasizing the importance of :</p><p>·       Adapting policies and guidelines to conform to global guidelines on SRHR</p><p>·       Instituting mechanisms and procedures for monitoring the enforcement of policies.</p><p>·       Developing communication strategies for policies</p><p>·       Adolescents’ participation in development of policies and policy guidelines</p><p>·       Enacting comprehensive policies that integrate ASRH issues, child development, quality primary health care and social development to ensure broad benefits for Children, Adolescents Young People (CAYP), families, and  communities</p><p>·       Using multiple platforms for SRHR policy implementation</p>",

As a result of the recent development especially the new International Development Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo-ICPD, 1994) there has been a paradigm shift on Population and development issues from exclusive focus on FP for fertility control to a broader and more inclusive concept of reproductive health.</p><p>The new paradigm shift on population and development issues calls for multi-sectoral approach and complementary role of various sectors.  To guide in the implementation of the identified population concerns, the National Council for Population and Development (NCPD) over the years developed and implemented a number of Population Policies together with Plans of Action. These policies and Action Plans have articulated the multi-sectoral approach and the complementary role of various actors in implementing the identified population concerns. The mandate of NCPD is to coordinate the implementation of population policies and programmes in Kenya. Over the years, the implementation of the population programme has witnessed increased government commitment and support from development partners.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To ensure a multi-sectoral approach to implementation of population programmes, NCPD has established a coordination mechanism through Technical Working Groups (TWGs) for Family Planning Programmes at national and county levels. The role of the TWGs is to harmonize FP commitments and activities through strong technical coordination and accountability frameworks. The TWG is a technical coordination of public, NGOs, CSOs, Private Sector, RH department in Ministry of Health, potential family planning advocacy partners. These forums are critical at both national and county levels since health system is decentralized.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Technical Working Groups (TWGs) are coordinated by NCPD at both national and county levels by ensuring that efforts of stakeholders are harmonized towards the achievements of the population policy goals. They provide useful platform for building accountability frameworks that will ensure that FP services continue to be managed within a Human Rights Framework agreed upon at 1994 ICPD. The TWGs hold the government, service providers, donors accountable to the commitments that they have made through protocols such as the London FP summit in July 2012.</p><p><strong>The main roles of TWGs</strong></p>\t<li>Appraise policies, programmes and priority areas of population and development interventions at National and County levels</li>\t<li>Oversee through a multi-sectoral approach the development of comprehensive, innovative and integrated strategies that advocate for FP and ensure sustainable development</li>\t<li>Play both an oversight and an advocacy role and employ participatory approaches in FP advocacy interventions by building synergy</li>\t<li>Position the population agenda which includes access to FP services at the centre of development</li>\t<li>Identify priority areas for interventions in conformity with the defined population and development coordination framework</li>\t<li>Ensure that population issues are mainstreamed into County policies and programmes in order to achieve sustainable development</li>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>TWGs ensure that efforts of stakeholders are harmonized towards achievement of population and development goals at National and County levels.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>While a national policy addressing teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among youth may provide direction, the implementation, resource generation, monitoring and evaluation of programs for youth depends largely on local government units. In recent years, the Puerta Princesa city government in the Philippines has established several governance bodies involved in addressing adolescent reproductive health issues. The City Health Board has been established to discuss all health-related issues requiring policy and funding support and monitoring. Particularly, the Local Council for the Protection of Children has been revitalized and expanded. However, despite these efforts to address adolescent reproductive health issues in the city, teenage pregnancy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases continue to increase. Hence, there is a need to understand the complexity of this issue and provide policy alternatives that the city government can consider.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aims to identify, understand and analyze the policy options available for implementing a local strategy to handle adolescent reproductive health particularly teenage pregnancy and common STIs. The goal of this policy paper is to recommend policy alternatives that can be adopted by the Puerta Princesa city government.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This is a qualitative, mixed-method study. The primary sources of data will be semi-structured Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth Key Informant Interviews (KII) complemented by a review of policy documents of the local government and health office. Officials from the different city offices and volunteers involved in the formulation and implementation of related adolescent reproductive health programs were the target population of the study. The city officials and relevant stakeholders were purposively chosen and agreed upon by the project team and the city population officer of Puerto Princesa city. A list of prospective KII respondents and FGD participants at the city and <em>barangay</em> levels was generated and was provided to the City Health Office (CHO). An appointment matrix was drawn to guide the CHO in coordinating and scheduling data gathering with the different offices. In instances where the head of office was not available at the time of the interview, a representative knowledgeable about the interventions was interviewed. A total of eighteen (18) individuals participated in the study. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Findings showed that, despite several efforts by the city government and private sectors, the local government reported a lack of harmonized and integrated processes in terms of planning, funding, implementing and monitoring. Hence, the lack of an integrated and comprehensive plan for adolescent reproductive health is apparent. Third, there seems to be weak community governance and participation in the implementation of the programs as evidenced by the absence of <em>barangay</em> (village) plans outlining adolescent reproductive health- related activities and funding support. Lastly, although the city government is supporting the youth organization by funding their activities, youth participation is still limited to organizing activities and training young leaders in the city. Youth involvement is not yet institutionalized in terms of planning, implementation and monitoring of programs. Hence, policy alternatives must developed to strengthen city governance structure, planning, financing and monitoring mechanism to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health issues of the community.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The City Health Leadership and Governance Program (CLGP), which was developed for city level local executives, is part of the DOH Health Leadership and Governance Program. Multi- sectoral key stakeholder health leadership teams were formed in cities and trained to identify and address inequities in health service access as well as the social determinants that affect demand and access. Since its implementation, there has been initial success, as manifested in marked improvements in maternal and child health outcomes, as well as in health financing for maternal and child health programs. With city mayors having a better understanding of significant health issues in their jurisdictions, working relationships between and among different city departments involved in the CLGP has also improved.</p><p>However, despite gains in maternal and child health, comparing city level data with partner cities disclosed a significant increase in the number and percentage of births by adolescents. Similarly, there was also an increase in cases of STIs and HIV among the younger age groups. The data on teenage births from partner cities show a higher number of births than the national average.</p><p>Hence, policy alternatives must developed to strengthen city governance structure, planning, financing and monitoring mechanism to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health issues of the community.</p>",

      "title": "Harnessing effective partnership for advocacy: A case of Family Planning Advocacy in Kisii County. ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Since 2010 the devolved system of health at the county level has had a share of success and problems and Kisii County is not an exception. Over the years, the County Government of Kisii has allocated inadequate resources towards Sexual and reproductive health and Rights programmes and <strong>Family planning</strong>. In the fiscal years 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 for example, the county government of Kisii allocated KES 2.02 billion (26%), 2.8 billion (31%) and 2.99 billion (31%) respectively for health; preventive and promotive health was allocated KES 7.350,000 (0.24%) in the Fiscal Year 2016/17 with no mention of allocation towards family planning as a sub program. The less focus on budgetary allocation towards Family Planning was attributed to uncoordinated advocacy among stakeholders and fear of advocacy for family planning as it was considered contentious issue among the policy makers. This saw the increased rising cases of teenage pregnancies in the county and rising cases of unsafe abortion.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In 2015 Network for Adolescents and Youth of Africa through her intervention in the county formed the Kisii County Reproductive Health CSOs network, consisting of 12 CSOs. The network further incorporated members of the County Health Management Team (CHMT) mandated with health issues in the county for joint advocacy. The network developed an advocacy strategy to guide coordination and implementation of advocacy in the county. The key mandates of the network are; advocate for budgetary allocation for Family planning; advocate for formulation and implementation of Family planning policies (Costed Implementation plan) and integration of youth friendly services within health facilities.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Development of advocacy strategy: </strong>NAYA together with the CSOs network and CHMT developed Kisii County budget advocacy strategy that informs advocacy activities, with clear power analysis of the audience to be involved towards advocatinng for allocation of resources for family planning.                                                                                                                                                       <strong>Budget analysis and alternative budgets: </strong>NAYA together with the CSOs network analyzed the Fiscal Strategy Paper for the fiscal years and Budget Estimates to identify gaps such a lack of consideration of family planning as a subprogram in preventive and promotive, generate key ASKs for advocacy. The network together with the CHMT developed and presented alternative Family Planning programme based budget to the County assembly.                                                                                                           <strong>Public participation and strategic meetings:</strong> the CSOs network mobilized community members for public participation during budget making processes to build a case for family planning. The network also held consultative meetings with members of county assembly towards budgetary allocation for family planning and submitted budget memorandum with Key ASKs.                        <strong>Formation of champions among policy makers:</strong> the CSO network identified Policy makers who are pro health to be champions for family planning and thus were able to reach out to other members of county assembly opposed to family planning on the need to allocate</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Coordinated CSO voices </strong>there exists a stronger network of stakeholders advocating for resource allocation towards family planning and provision of services. This has led to the network getting audience from the policy makers on importance of family planning and an initiative that has motivated Policy makers become family planning champions in the assembly and push for resources to be allocated towards family planning.</p><p><strong>Technical support in development of policies and legislation:</strong> The network provides Technical support (TA) to the CHMT in developing advocacy materials such as policy briefs and fact sheets of family planning for members of county assembly. The network also provided technical support to members of county assembly on program based budgeting to ensure inclusion of family planning as a sub program in the budget.</p><p><strong>Increased budget allocation to health and Specific budget line to family planning:</strong> Through joint advocacy efforts, the county government of Kisii County has continued to progressively increase health budget above 15% of above Abuja declaration. For the first time in the county government allocated 7 million to family planning in the financial year 2016/17.</p><p><strong>Data management:</strong> the CSOs network working together with the County Health Management Team have collaboratively continued to take stoke of RH and family planning uptake data in the county and monitor quality of data and make use of the data available to improve quality provision of services in the county.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>NAYA together with CSO s network learnt that workining together in advocacy enhnces greater impact thus Working in an all-inclusive advocacy network helps to achieve results than working in isolation, a case of Kisii County where joint advocacy efforts led to the county government allocating KES 7,000,000 to FP. Working in a network of CSOs enhances ease in pulling of resources together and sustainability of advocacy activities in the county.  Working together with and mobilizing community members for public participation during budget making process creates bigger community conversation on the need for the policy makers to prioritize family planning and allocate resources towards family planning as a community need.  Identification of policy makers who are pro health and working with  policy makers as champions of family planning is key in reaching out to other leaders who are opposed to family planning and increses their support and committment towards family planning. </p>",

      "title": "Innovation &amp; Collaboration to remove barriers to Family Planning Services in Africa’s most populated city",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Nigeria, Africa’s most populated nation launched its Family Planning Blueprint in 2014 which aspires to increase Family Planning use from 15 to 36 percent nationally by 2018. This would require Lagos State to increase its FP uptake from 48 to 74 percent by 2018 (now revised after the 2017 London Summit to 2020.) Only 26.4 percent of contraceptive users who are married women are presently using a modern method and less than three percent are long-acting methods</p><p></p><p>Lagos State holds the smallest land area of 356,861 hectares but has the largest population size of all the states in Nigeria. The Lagos State Bureau of Statistics estimates the total population in 2018 at 25 million people with a growth rate of 3.2 percent.</p><p></p><p>The targeted increase in CPR alone would save an additional 657 mothers’ and 8,500 children lives by 2018. In addition, Lagos State would save an additional N3.5 billion (approx. $10 million) in direct healthcare expenses by 2018.</p><p></p><p>However, these achievable targets will not be possible without eliminating current barriers to FP method, choice and use – a major barrier is the out-of-pocket cost of consumables, especially at the local government supported Primary Health Centres.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>PACFaH@Scale is supporting An FP advocacy working group, now known as the Public Health Sustainable Advocacy Initiative (PHSAI) was established in January 2015 comprising civil society, faith-based organizations, the media, and local government units for budget and reproductive health and family planning.</p><p>PHSAI applied the AFP SMART advocacy approach to the problem of consumables costs. Although Lagos State had a family planning budget, the local government area (LGA) and LCDA budgets—a potential source of funds for consumables—did not.</p><p>Their objective to create dedicated local budgets for family planning services stalled due to uncertain political climate during the general elections in 2015.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In late 2015, PHSAI re-focused their advocacy on Lagos State’s Honorable Commissioner for Health. The working group met with the commissioner in January 2016 to present the many barriers women face in obtaining family planning services, including costs. After seeing the evidence, the state commissioner agreed that consumables should be funded and issued a policy directive mandating that family planning services in Lagos should be completely free of charge to the client. In accordance with this directive, the Lagos Director of Primary Healthcare informed all medical officers of health, who coordinate health services in LGAs and LCDAs, to put an end to user fees. However, the State Ministry of Health did not allocate any additional funds to support this directive, and LGAs and LCDAs still did not have a separate budget for family planning. The mandate was unlikely to be implemented without additional advocacy.</p><p>PHSAI spent months in 2016 reaching out to key stakeholders in Lagos with support from partners. They engaged with sole administrators of the local government areas, heads of local council development areas, medical officers of health, and chairmen of community development committees. Together they identified ways to leverage existing funds for family planning.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>PHSAI’s continuous engagement since 2015 with medical officers of health from across the state proved fruitful. PHSAI attended one of the medical officers’ monthly meetings to discuss the state commissioner’s new directive. Their advocacy, backed by the directive, inspired the officers to discuss funding solutions, such as using their own monthly funds, called imprest, to cover the consumables costs. In November 2016, Yaba’s medical officer of health directed the four primary health care centers within his jurisdiction to allocate funds from the imprest for family planning consumables. All of the centers in Yaba complied, allocating between $32 and $64 per month. The four health care centers serve a catchment population of 260,510.</p><p>With the final cost barrier removed, Yaba is seeing a surge in family planning visits. In the first nine months of 2017, 1,644 family planning visits occurred where the client received a method of contraception. Compared to the same time period in 2016 (1,242 visits), the total volume of family planning service provision increased 32%. This is a positive indication that as family planning services become increasingly available to users free of charge, contraceptive uptake will also continue to rise.</p><p>The successful implementation of free family planning services in Yaba will likely be a catalyst—already other LCDAs in Lagos state are following suit. In 2017, the Lagos State Primary Healthcare Board for the first time in history created a specific budget line for family planning consumables in the sum of N50 million ( approx. $.140,000)</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>PACFaH@Scale has discovered that one major lesson for advocacy is to work innovatively with what you have: PHSAI originally sought to establish a specific local government budget for family planning consumables. But when the state health commissioner approved a directive, they did not wait to act. They worked with stakeholders to identify ways to cover the costs leveraging existing funds.</p><p>Secondly, advocates must start collaboration early and maintain it throughout: Members of the reproductive health department from the Lagos State Ministry of Health participated actively in PHSAI. They opened up many inroads for the advocates early in the advocacy process. Continuous engagement with the Primary Healthcare Board and medical officers of health led to forward momentum. When the directive came through, all stakeholders were already on board to follow through and find creative ways to implement the directive.</p><p>PACFaH@Scale is committed to scaling up the lessons learnt with PHSAI by sharing with State and Local Governments throughout Nigeria.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Pendant près d’un siècle, Madagascar a été régi par la loi nationale de 1920 qui interdisait la publicité et les produits relatifs à la planification familiale (PF). Même si l’utilisation de la contraception a commencé en 1967, la légalité de l’offre de services PF n’était pas claire. Le taux de mortalité maternelle est encore élevé, à 478 sur 100 000 naissances vivantes, et les besoins non satisfaits pour la PF (18%) persistent au pays, surtout dans les zones enclavées. Tandis que les méthodes de PF sont fournies par des agents communautaires bénévoles depuis 1999, des discussions ont lieu fréquemment au Ministère de la Santé Publique (MSANP) au sujet de la poursuite ou non de la distribution de PF à base communautaire (DBC). La croissance de la population est élevée, à 2,7%, exacerbant l’économie peu performante de Madagascar et impactant négativement l’environnement. Les acteurs clés ont convenu de la nécessité d’une nouvelle loi régissant les services de santé reproductive (SR) et de PF et ont exprimé le souhait d’une croissance économique; le MSANP avait donc préparé une loi en 2013. Malheureusement, ce projet de loi était en attente à la direction législative du ministère de la Justice pendant plusieurs années. </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>La Direction de la santé familiale (DSFa), le projet <em>Health Policy Plus</em> (HP+), financé par l’USAID, le projet Advance Family Planning (AFP), des partenaires techniques, la société civile, et des juristes ont constitué un Comité Loi PF afin d’examiner le projet de loi PF qui était resté bloqué. À la suite de l’examen, le projet HP+ et le projet Advance Family Planning (AFP) ont organisé une formation sur la stratégie de plaidoyer des « gains rapides » d’AFP pour les membres du Comité Loi PF. Un plan SMART qui éclaircit les étapes était établi avec les messages clairs et adaptés.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Pour éviter les retards, une personne-ressource expérimentée en processus législatif a été intégrée au Comité Loi PF. HP+ et AFP ont formé les membres du comité à l’approche AFP SMART, un processus en neuf étapes pour un plaidoyer collaboratif qui mène à des « gains rapides » tels que des actions de politique et des décisions de financement. Les neuf étapes sont : décider qui impliquer, définir des objectifs SMART, identifier le décideur clé, examiner le contexte, connaitre le décideur, formuler la bonne requête de plaidoyer, préparer un plan de travail, établir des précédents pour évaluer le progrès, exécuter et évaluer.</p><p>Le processus législatif a guidé le comité par le biais d’activités de plaidoyer auprès du Conseil du gouvernement, du Conseil des ministres, de la Commission santé de l’Assemblée nationale, de l’Assemblée nationale en session plénière, de la Commission socioculturelle du Sénat et enfin du Sénat en plénière. La méthodologie AFP SMART était appliquée à chaque étape du processus d’adoption, avec l’accent sur la détermination des décideurs clés et l’adaptation des messages, par exemple, messages sur les avantages de la PF à l’Assemblée Nationale et messages incluant des informations sur le dividende démographique et la croissance économique aux sénateurs. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>La nouvelle loi portant sur la santé de la reproduction et la planification familiale (SR/PF) à Madagascar a été promulguée par le président du pays en janvier 2018. Du début de la formation AFP SMART à la promulgation, le Comité Loi PF a passé 16 mois à plaider en faveur du projet de loi. Cet intervalle de temps est un succès considérable pour Madagascar, compte tenu des longs délais nécessaires à d’autres pays pour des changements similaires. Le comité a contribué à sa réussite grâce à la persistance et à la nature adaptative du processus de plaidoyer, en s’efforçant de comprendre les obstacles auxquels sont confrontés des décideurs spécifiques, en adaptant les messages de plaidoyer pour prendre en compte ces obstacles et en utilisant le meilleur messager pour chaque public. Le succès est également attribuable à la synergie collaborative des actions des parties prenantes.</p><p>La nouvelle loi est un énorme progrès à l’égard de services de santé reproductive fondés sur des droits puisqu’elle garantit les services de PF à tous désirants, quels que soient leur âge, leur situation matrimoniale ou d’autres facteurs. La loi protège les femmes, les jeunes et les prestataires de services en PF. Elle assure la poursuite de la DBC de contraceptifs injectables par des agents communautaires bénévoles, étend l’accès aux zones enclavées et encourage l’accès équitable. Cet accès accru a le pouvoir de répondre aux besoins non satisfaits pour la PF, augmenter le TPC, de diminuer la mortalité maternelle et d’améliorer la santé des femmes. </p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>La nouvelle loi non seulement illustre l’engagement du gouvernement malgache à respecter ses responsabilités pour FP2020, mais elle crée également des possibilités dans d’autres domaines. Puisque la loi légalise la prestation de services de PF pour toutes les femmes et en élargit l’accès, elle encourage l’autonomisation des femmes et l’équité entre les sexes. La promulgation de cette loi pour Madagascar favorise le développement durable dans la mesure où elle permet de profiter du dividende démographique par le biais d’un changement dans la pyramide des âges.</p><p>Pour autant, la synergie des parties prenantes sera encore nécessaire pour appuyer le MSANP dans l’exécution de la loi. HP+ continuera d’appuyer le Comité Loi PF pour soutenir les campagnes de plaidoyer et de sensibilisation, promouvoir l’éducation juridique chez le public, les agents de santé et les responsables du gouvernement afin d’avoir la certitude que les personnes concernées par la loi connaissent et comprennent leurs rôles, leurs responsabilités et leurs droits. Le comité devra compter sur les champions de la PF qui sont apparus au cours de ce processus et regroupent des députés, des sénateurs et l’ancienne secrétaire générale de MSANP. Le Comité Loi PF soutiendra l’élaboration des arrêtés d’application, encouragera les fonctionnaires à exprimer leur engagement à l’égard de la nouvelle loi et son exécution, et suivra le progrès des actions qui contribuent à un environnement juridique habilitant en faveur des services de PF et SR fondés des droits à Madagascar. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Vietnam’s national population and family planning (PFP)has been successful in reducing total fertility rate (TFR) and increasing contraceptive prevalence (CPR) which contributed to significant economic progress.  Although, Vietnam is confronted with new demographic and economic challenges that require its FP program to rethink its strategy to respond to the changing health markets and varying contraceptive demands. Vietnam’s economic progress has also resulted in a significant decrease of international support to Vietnam’s FP program. In 2016, the government of Vietnam made a commitment to support FP2020 goals with the emphasis on strengthening intersectoral cooperation on youth reproductive and sexual health, and promoting youth participation in developing and improving cooperation between public and private providers to increase youth-friendly service and contraceptive methods.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>With this backdrop, we collaborated with Vietnam’s the General Office for Population and Family Planning (GOPFP) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to gather evidence and develop a viable “socialized” FP model that seeks to improving access and availability of quality contraceptives and family planning services in Vietnam.    In order to support Vietnam’s GOFP, we investigated the current landscape of Vietnam’s demographic trend, contraceptive dynamics, abortion trends along with an assessment of Vietnam’s service delivery model for contraceptive and FP services.  Using this evidence, we provided recommendations for the improvement of the current PFP strategy and developed a “socialized” FP</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A comprehensive approach of data analyses and synthesis was used: 1. Policy Review and Analyses; 2. Review of Secondary Data and the Literature; and 3. Qualitative Analysis of Primary Data.We conducted an in-depth review of both published and unpublished literature, secondary data, and primary data.We also sought inputs from key actors in the public and private sector (policy makers, providers, and end-users) throughout different levels of the health systems.   We reviewed a number of national FP and health service delivery models from other countries (e.g., China, Indonesia, Korea, UK, etc.) to inform the development of a “<em>socialized</em>” model.  In this context, a “<em>socialized</em>” health model is defined as the full participation and shared responsibility of the public and private health sectors, the commercial sector, and the beneficiaries.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Between 1970-2002, Vietnam’s TFR fell from 5.9 to 1.9 children per woman.TFR varies between rural and urban settings (2.0 vs. 1.4 children per women).  There are also regional differences; TFR is highest in the Central Highlands (2.9) and the lowest in the Southeast (1.5). </p><p></p><p>Vietnam’s TFR (1.7-2.0 overall) is under replacement level, sex ratio (113.8) is becoming imbalanced with more males vs. females, and abortion rate (26 per 1,000 women) equates to 2.5 abortions per woman per lifetime.Young people (aged 15-24 years) make up ~18% of Vietnam’s population<strong>; </strong><strong>and, 24% are <strong>.</strong></strong></p><p></p><p>About 80% of the national budget for purchasing contraceptives came from foreign aid between 1996 and 2006.The delivery of FP services has mainly been dependent on the public health systems, through commune health stations (CHSs).  With the introduction of user fees at the district health level, legalization of private clinics, and deregulation of the sale of drugs, developments of CHSs’ infrastructure and expertise fell behind which led to the under-utilization of CHSs.  Approximately 68% of current users obtain their FP method from public health providers.  The most commonly used method is the IUD (used by 38% of married women); although, it remains as the only widely available LARC which limits women’s contraceptive choices.</p><p></p><p>The private sector provides 60% of all general outpatient visits (including FP), and remains unregulated.There is a need to develop a total market approach to financing FP services that takes advantage of the existing national health insurance system.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>We developed a new national “socialized” FP model that encompass the full participation and shared responsibility of the public and private health sectors, the commercial sector, and the beneficiaries.  The model aims to:</p><ul>\t<li>Allow the public and private health sector, and the commercial sector to have full participation in the health markets;</li>\t<li>Leverage and maximize the expertise across sectors;</li>\t<li>Engage with the beneficiaries to develop contraceptive &amp; programs that address their needs;</li>\t<li>Share the financial burden across the sectors and the beneficiaries; &amp;,</li>\t<li>Moves from a target-driven national FP program to one that aims at achieving quality of population health. </li></ul><p>In this model, we developed strategies to segment the beneficiaries, outlined priorities for the health systems, and proposed a new financing mechanism.  The population of focus within this new model include the poor and underserved, young and unmarried, factory workers and ethnic minorities.  There are five areas of prioritization for the health systems: 1. Strengthen the procurement of contraceptive supply and distribution; 2. Improve CHSs ability to provide a wide range of short-term and long-term contraceptives; 3. Develop reliable information, education, and commutation strategy for contraception and SRH for young/unmarried individuals and factory workers; 4. Strengthen mechanism for the introduction and supply of new contraceptive commodities; 5. Develop a comprehensive approach for quality of care.   We proposed the strengthening of the current national health insurance along with the introduction of a user-fee and subsidized fee payment system for beneficiaries.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The sexual and reproductive health of adolescents and youth is a pressing concern, especially because the world has a larger population of young people now than ever before (Chandra – Mouli et al, 2015; Woog, et al, 2015). About one third (36.5 million) of Nigeria's total population are youth between the ages of 10 and 24 and It is estimated that by 2025, the number of Nigerian youth will exceed 57 million (FMOH 2011; NDHS 2013; Santhya&amp; Jejeebhoy, 2015; NBS, 2015; Envuladu et al, 2017). Nigeria has the highest rates of adolescent fertility in sub-Saharan Africa and over 900 000 births to adolescents occur annually and 150 out of every 1000 women who give birth in Nigeria are 19 years old or under (FMOH, 2011; NDHS, 2013; Abiodun et al, 2016). Unfortunately, contraceptive knowledge, intention, adoption and continuous use is very poor among young people.</p><p>Ideation is the concept that people’s actions are influenced strongly by their beliefs, ideas and feelings and that changing these ideational factors can change behaviors, including contraceptive behavior. On the other hand, Latent class analysis (LCA) helps to identify homogenous underlying groupings. LCA identifies and group individuals that are similar based on specific variables. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What is the effect of latent class analysis of ideational factors on contraceptive use and intention among young people in Kaduna and Lagos states, Nigeria?          </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A cross sectional study (Omnibus survey)was conducted in Kaduna and Lagos States by the Nigeria Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI) in September 2017. Data were drawn and pooled from three rounds of six months of data collection survey for young women of reproductive age (WRA) 18-24 years (n=542) in urban and rural areas- sample equally divided between urban and rural.</p><p>The sample size for the study was equally divided between never married (49.6%) and ever-married (50.4%) youth. Majority (82.5%) of respondents had post-primary education and almost half (46.5%) already had at least one child.</p><p>Selection of respondents was done using multi-stage stratified random sampling.High level of methods awareness, high level of perceived self-efficacy, rejection of most myths, recommended FP, need permission and perceived most/all peers using FP were ideational variables assessed in the study. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to determine ideational classes in the population.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The study shows that generally, young people are not very knowledgeable about contraceptive methods (31% in Kaduna and 32.4% in Lagos) and perceived self-efficacy for contraceptive use-related actions is only moderate (57.4% in Kaduna and 57% in Lagos). Most of the young people retained some myths about Family Planning (FP) (28.5% in Kaduna and 21.9% in Lagos). Most young people also perceived social approval for FP (82.7% in Kaduna and 76.6% in Lagos).  Personal advocacy in favor of FP (14.4% in Kaduna and 8.3% in Lagos) is not very common. </p><p>The data reveal three distinct homogenous latent classes. All the three classes are not very knowledgeable about FP. However, there are significant differences among them. The young women in class 1 are moderately knowledgeable and efficacious; they also tend to reject myths and engage in personal advocacy in favor of FP. This class scored lower than Class 2 in terms of perceived social approval for FP and myths rejection. Class 2 is considerably mixed in terms of the ideational characteristics. Whereas the indicators of perceived self-efficacy, myths rejection and perceived social approval were highest in this class, the indicators of methods awareness, personal efficacy and descriptive norm were very low. Most indicators are lowest in Class 3.</p><p></p><p>Indicators of contraceptive use and intention differ considerably by ideational class. As expected, the women in Class 1 (46.0%) were most likely to currently use modern contraceptive methods and to intend to use (69.5). Conversely both indicators (22.2%:25.3%) were lowest in Class 3. </p>",

In answering the research question that has been set for this study, the study reveals that among young women in the study location, Indicators of contraceptive use and intention differ considerably by ideational class.Also, the study shows that increase contraceptive awareness and positioning Family Planning as the norm are relevant in the study areas.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Although there is clear evidence that comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) can positively impact the sexual and reproductive health and rights of adolescents and youth, implementation of high-quality CSE programs remains a significant challenge. The United Nation’s 2018 International Technical Guidelines on Sexuality Education readily identifies that engagement of young people in CSE delivery significantly increases the reach, attractiveness, relevance, and effectiveness of interventions. However, most research has focused on top-down, institutionalized approaches to CSE, resulting in further top-down policy and programmatic responses. More evidence is needed on innovations in youth-oriented CSE delivery approaches to improve its implementation at both national and international levels.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Projet Jeune Leader is a youth-led and youth-centered organization that directly implements an integrated and multi-component CSE program in public middle schools in Madagascar. This innovative model uses highly trained and monitored young adults as sexuality educators to strengthen existing school systems, providing not only CSE, but also a package of services (medical referrals, counseling, extracurricular activities, programs for parents) as part of an interrelated whole-school approach. Past pretest-posttest program evaluations have shown that after receiving Projet Jeune Leader’s year-long programming, adolescents reported more gender-equitable attitudes towards sex, more positive attitudes about condoms, and higher perceived vulnerability to early pregnancy.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A more rigorous quasi-experimental program outcome evaluation is being conducted during the 2017-2018 school year. The aim is to generate proof of concept, as well as advance knowledge of best practices of CSE programming.</p><p>Students (<em>average age</em> = 13) at Projet Jeune Leader partner “intervention” schools (<em>n </em>= 1,235) and comparison schools (<em>n </em>= 1,001) completed baseline measures of knowledge, attitudes, perceived social support, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions related to sexual and reproductive health and gender norms at the beginning of the school year (November 2017).</p><p>Intervention and comparison schools were matched on geographic location (rural vs. peri-urban), size of the school, and socioeconomic level of the body (estimated using a proxy indicator). Cluster sampling was used to select respondents at each school included in the sample.  </p><p>Students at intervention schools will receive a year-long stand-alone CSE course and access to safe school-based recreational spaces, counselling services, medical referrals.</p><p>Endline measures will be collected at the end of the school year in August 2018. Changes in outcomes from the beginning to end of the school year will be compared between intervention and comparison schools to estimate impact of Projet Jeune Leader programming.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Response rates for baseline measures were high (&gt; 99%). Data was cleaned and disaggregated by grade, age, and gender. There were no significant differences in demographic data between the two groups.</p><p>Initial analysis of the baseline data revealed interesting differences between students at certain intervention schools where Projet Jeune Leader has worked for multiple years, and their matched comparisons. Specifically, students who received Projet Jeune Leader programming as very young adolescents (10-14-year-olds) were significantly more likely (<em>p</em> <p>These initial differences, as well as differences in dosage of intervention received by Projet Jeune Leader partner schools, will be adjusted for in final analysis after endline measures are collected. A full report of the study results will be completed in October 2018. The main findings of this study will be presented at the ICFP 2018.</p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This study is the first of its kind in generating data on indicators related to sexual and reproductive health and gender norms of young adolescents in Madagascar. Moreover, this study addresses international gaps in evidence on innovative, youth-centered multicomponent CSE programs in low-income countries.</p><p>Given that research thus far has shown that the top-down delivery of CSE incurs many challenges, promising results on this model can serve as an important case study. Innovative approaches of CSE delivery which maintain all characteristics of effective programs outlined by the United Nations are needed to fully uphold young people’s right to receive quality CSE. Findings will be applicable to multiple low-income contexts where CSE delivery remains a significant challenge.</p><p></p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>FGAE has learned out of its half century experiences and from evidence-based practices to improve its interventions and adopt tailored user friendly strategies to reach adolescents and youth through sexuality and reproductive health services. The project which is under evaluation was implemented in different locations namely Zeway, Weliso, Fitche, Debressina, Kemisse, Ghmbi, Bedele, Mettu and Welkite from which three geographic locations; namely Debresina (Amhara region), Ghimbi and Woliso (both in Oromiya Region) were selected to collect primary data. The primary targets for the implemented project included, married and unmarried adolescents &amp; youth in urban and rural areas, with particular focus to young people with disabilities, youth in higher learning institutions and large scale work places and in-and-out-of-school young people.</p><p>The period covered in the implemented project were three years, sub-dived into three phases. The first quarter of 2013 was devoted to conduct baseline assessment, mapping resources and reorganize partnership networks. From the 2nd quarter of 2013 to the 4th quarter of 2015 was dedicated to implement the project. The last phase, which is towards the end of 2015, was dedicated to project outcome evaluation.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In order to achieve the overall goal of the project “to improve sexual and reproductive health among adolescents and youth.” FGAE has designed and implemented specific project components that address adolescents &amp; youth. The project has identified key strategies and expected outcomes which have to be followed in the implementation process and subject for measurement at the end of the project life. By use of these strategies and by implementing specific activities, a list of outcomes is achieved at various levels (macro, facilities and beneficiary levels). </p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Location:</strong> The geographic scope covers Debresina, Welisso and Ghmbi</p><p><strong>Data Sources </strong></p><p>The evaluation generated data from two major sources. The primary data are generated from the field through the quantitative survey, qualitative interviews and observations. On the other hand, baseline report, project plan, project reports and other relevant documents were used as compiled sources of data</p><p><strong>Beneficiaries </strong></p><p>The beneficiaries were adolescent and youth sub-groups who were the beneficiaries of tailored SRH information and user friendly SRH services.</p><p><strong><em>Participant Size </em></strong></p><p>117 individuals (69 males and 48 females) were engaged</p><p><strong>Design </strong></p><p>The evaluation applied a mixed methods design (MMD) whereby the process has mixed the quantitative and qualitative method of data collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of the findings. The quantitative design has chosen a survey technique using which questionnaires were developed to generate data from adolescent and youth groups who have been direct beneficiaries/participants of the project. The qualitative design, on the other hand used mixed techniques including case study, storytelling and phenomenological explorations through which participants told their personal stories, expressed the phenomena within the context of the project intervention and their lived experiences as the result of their participation in one or more of the project activities/services. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The three top available services known by majority of the respondents are Family planning services (97%), HIV counseling and testing services (97%) and availability of trained peer educators (96%). The project implemented by FGAE and its partners has brought a significant result. Because, almost the factors we treated as measures of knowledge of the group towards the available services indicate tremendous descriptive counts, all of which are over 70% and the majority are over 90%. This high proportion of descriptive responses was also supported by the qualitative data generated through the interviews we made with various youth groups. However, it is also important to note about few of the services such as antenatal and postnatal cares, comprehensive abortion care and availability of skilled persons for safe delivery, the proportion of survey respondents with the knowledge of the existence of the services is lesser compared to their knowledge regarding other services. We observed that attitude of majority of youths towards youth-friendly tailored SRH services is positive. Younger groups (17 years or less) have lesser positive attitude towards availability of comprehensive abortion care and skilled persons to provide safe delivery compared other sub-age groups. But this does not always hold true as qualitative data reveals. On the other hand, ethnicity and religious based quantitative data witnessed that the attitude of respondents towards the three services mentioned above are less positive. Among those who are sexually active, 71% of 17 years old or less, 90% of 18-20 years old, 92% of 21-23 years</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>From the evaluation process we came to learn that there were 12 types of specific services under the general ‘youth-friendly tailored SRH services. Comprehensiveness nature of the project is also seen not only from the service components but also from reaching the diverse target groups. SRH services provided by FGAE were comprehensive as the result of which the youth groups like too much to continuously visit the youth centers and the clinics where all services are available in a single menu from which service users make their own choice depending upon what services are appropriate to them.</p><p>Accordingly, the project under evaluation has documented a number of lessons that can be drawn as strengths or gaps experienced during the process of project implementation, Some of the lessons could include; joint planning with different stakeholders, using potentials of young people &amp; partner institutions, the capacity that change challenges into opportunities, putting the youth at the center of the project, use of entertainment as means of attracting the SRH services users, effective use of peer education method, effective use of local structure, the effective out-reach services that addressed the needs of rural youths and integration of entertainment with SRH service provision. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Il ressort de l’enquête démographique de santé (EDS 2010-2011)[1] que les adolescentes de 15 à 19 ans constituent 22 % de l'ensemble des femmes en âge de procréer. Elles  contribuent pour près de 10 % à la fécondité totale des femmes.  En effet, 15% des femmes de 20-49 ans avaient déjà eu des rapports sexuels avant l’âge de 15 ans. Les femmes rurales entrent dans la vie sexuelle 3,5 ans avant celles du milieu urbain. On constate que 19 % des 15-19 ans ont déjà débuté leur vie féconde : 16 % ont  eu au moins un enfant et 3 % sont enceintes pour la première fois. Les femmes non instruites commencent à être sexuellement plus actives 6 ans avant celles qui ont atteint le niveau secondaire (17,7 ans contre 23,8 ans). C’est dans ce contexte que l’approche « clubs de jeunes filles » a été initié dans les quartiers de Kolda. Cette région est marquée par les mariages d’enfant, grossesses précoces et VIH/Sida. Cela est lié aux facteurs culturels. Ainsi, l’objectif visé à travers le clubs des jeunes fillzes, c’est de promouvoir le leadership des filles pour mieux lutte contre les mariages d’enfants et les grossesses précoces dont elles sont souvent</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Young people in Tanzania need better information on contraception.  Sixty-seven percent of unmarried, sexually active women aged 15-19 are using a modern method of contraception but only 10% of these who had recent contact with a health care professional had discussed contraception with them (Tanzanian DHS, 2015-16). </p><p>The ‘COTC club’ is a student-led, voluntary organisation based at the Clinical Officer Training College (COTC) in Mtwara, Tanzania that has provided interactive and informal contraceptive education in schools for 10 years.  The club visits 10 local schools/colleges per year to reach 2000 young people, linking COTC to its local community.   They offer small group teaching by knowledgeable and well-respected ‘near-peers’. </p><p>Good information on contraception is available online and 78% of Tanzanian households have a mobile phone (TDHS, 2015-17).  However, effective use of this resource requires private internet access, the ability to find suitable websites, skills to assess the quality of the information provided and links to local providers. Generic, contraceptive information websites intended for wide audiences may not respond to the specific needs of young people in Mtwara who may have specific questions about their own needs and preferences or access to local services. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>We developed and piloted an intervention based on the value of linked online/offline support. The intervention adds support to classroom based contraceptive education sessions by providing a phone number for young people to send anonymous questions by text message and posting these anonymised questions with answers a Facebook page “Tuongee Uzazi wa Mpango” (contraceptives conversations).  The aim was to provide an online resource, accessible at any time, but directly responsive to the concerns of students at the schools visited and trusted because of its association with the Clinical Officer students who had delivered the sex and relationship education programme.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We piloted the intervention during two contraceptive education sessions with 486 students.  The questions were uploaded with answers onto the Facebook page and online activity followed for three months without any additional promotion.

      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Linking traditional contraceptive education in schools and colleges with an online resource to provide opportunities for additional questions and continuing support is a feasible strategy for increasing access to contraceptive information.  It appears to engage young people, offering a safe and anonymous space with timely and accurate responses to their questions, including information that might not be included on traditional contraceptive information sites.  The link between face-to-face education and online follow-up may builds skills for online access to health information and may be particularly appropriate in communities where young people have limited health literacy.  Linked online/offline contraceptive education may be complementary with the online component amplifying traditional outreach programmes. This approach requires further piloting and evaluation at scale.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Tanzanian DHS, 2015-16.  https://dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-485.cfm</p>",

      "title": "What dictates the timing of first use of modern contraceptives? Survival Analysis of Time to Uptake of Modern Contraceptives among Never-Married Women in Nigeria, Mozambique, and Cote d’Ivoire.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The least developed parts of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa with a quarter of world population, bears a huge burden of the world population. The high fertility rates in sub-Saharan Africa have been linked to the low contraceptive use and has remained a public health challenge and a significant barrier to the attainment of sustainable development in Africa. The attendant consequences of poor utilization of modern contraceptives among women, especially the unmarried women, include sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancy which in turn leads to school dropout, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality and other poor pregnancy-related outcomes. Poor use of modern contraceptives among young unmarried women is a major factor influencing HIV incidence in Africa. These consequences are preventable with the use of modern contraception.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What is the timing of the first uptake of modern contraceptives after first sexual intercourse among never-married women in Nigeria, Mozambique and Cote d’Ivoire? Are the timings in the three countries different? What are the factors influencing the timing of the uptakes? This study was designed to determine the level as well as the time it takes sexually active women to start using modern contraceptives after their first sexual experience and to identify factors influencing the uptake in Nigeria, Mozambique and Cote d’Ivoire.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We used the data from the Mozambique, Nigeria, and Cote d’Ivoire Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2011, 2013 and 2014 respectively. The survey was cross-sectional in design and nationally representative in sampling. We extracted the contraceptive use history among sexually active never-married women. The analysis was carried out on the information provided by 8193 sexually active never-married women with 1785 (21.8%) from Mozambique, 4064 (49.6%) from Nigeria and 2344 (28.6%) from Cote d’Ivoire. The outcome of interest in this study is the survival time of uptake of a modern contraceptive,  computed as the time (years) difference between the age at the uptake of modern contraceptive and the age at first sexual intercourse. However, for those who had never used modern contraceptives, the survival time was the difference between the current age as of survey time and the age at first sexual intercourse, and they censored accordingly on the date of the survey. Descriptive statistics were used, Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to determine the rate of uptake among the never-married women in the three countries studied. Cox proportional hazards model was used to ascertain the variables affecting the time to the uptake of modern contraceptive among the woman across</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The proportion who ever used modern contraceptive was 29.5%, 44.2%, and 29.5% while the median time to modern contraceptive uptake was 2, 1 and 2 years among sexually active never-married women in Mozambique, Nigeria, and Cote d’Ivoire respectively. However, the incidence of the uptakes per year was similar in the three countries. Prevalence of Modern contraceptive use increased with educational attainment and reduced with women age except among women younger than 20 years who had lower use among those aged 20-24 years across the three countries. Mozambique women in the age group 20-24 years were 29% less likely than those in the age range 15-19 years (aHR=0.71(0.56-0.91)) to take up modern contraceptive. Generally, sexually active never-married women aged 40-45 years were 79% times less likely to take up modern contraceptive than those aged 15-20 years (aHR= 0.21(0.13-0.34)). Never married women in Nigeria who had no education were 16% (aHR=0.84(0.46-1.55)) less likely to take up modern contraceptive than those with higher education, while Mozambique never married women who reside in rural area were 11% less likely to take up modern contraceptive than those in urban area (aHR=0.89(0.64-1.23)). Never-married women from households in poorer wealth quintiles across the three countries had lower odds of up taking modern contraceptive than those from households in wealthier quintiles. The main significant determinants of timing of modern contraceptive uptake were respondents’ educational attainment, age, location, and household wealth quintile.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The rate of modern contraceptive uptake is generally low and delayed after first sexual intercourse across the countries. Although the use is higher in Nigeria than in the other countries, the timing of first use is earlier in Cote d’Ivoire and Mozambique than in Nigeria. To a large extent, respondents’ educational attainment, age, location, and household wealth quintile predicted the timing of modern contraceptive among never-married women in Mozambique, Nigeria, and Cote d'Ivoire. The low utilization and delayed uptake is a bait for a high number of unwanted pregnancies and HIV infections. There is need to urgently intervene in the utilization of modern contraceptives in these countries and in sub-Saharan Africa at large. An acceptable uptake of modern contraceptives requires enormous, multi-sectoral and well-coordinated efforts. The intervention should be in terms of proactive policy and actions to educate and promote modern contraceptive use among girls and women. There is need to extend such health education to male sexual partners as women may have weaker bargaining power. The traditional norm against modern contraceptive use in certain climes in Africa should be upturned while parental and community supports are worked upon. Also, modern contraceptives should be made to be more acceptable, available, accessible and affordable for the current situation to be overturned.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Girls need it to be easier to lead healthy lives and plan their futures, yet globally, traditional SRH programming has left 252 million adolescents currently with unmet need, suggesting there is room for improvement. In 2016, Population Services International’s (PSI) Adolescents360 (A360) project began with funding from the Gates and Children’s Investment Fund Foundations, aiming to turn this model ‘inside-out’, by placing girls at the center of programming. PSI uses a transdisciplinary approach, joining adolescent developmental science, public health and human-centered design (HCD). A360 interventions are designed with girls by revisiting evidence; leading with questions, curiosity and empathy; and getting out into her world.</p><p>There is a growing call among the adolescent reproductive health (ASRH) community—and beyond—for this kind of approach, one that is more responsive to clients’ needs, puts girls at the center, and co-creates with users; but there is still a gap in practical knowledge and guidance about how to marry this with the way implementing organizations traditionally operate. In Tanzania, A360 has identified, analyzed, and addressed many of the traditional structures that have long upheld development programming, but which have also remained indifferent to our global community’s calls for more nimble and responsive programs. Girls need it</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In Tanzania, A360 sought to build a truly girl-centered program—curious and responsive to girls’ views, wherever that might lead. But while design firms are structured for flexibility and iteration, many implementing partners are not. Applying A360’s transdisciplinary approach, including HCD and involving a broad range of expertise, places pressure on the status quo of management. How must organizations that plan to truly partner with girls change to enable this—not only conceptually, but practically? A360 adjusted many of its core ways of working including recruiting, procurement, and program review toward this end.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A360 took a continuous learning approach to evolving its managerial procedures in line with its iterative intervention design process with girls. Working with a range of experts from various sectors including design experts, behavioral scientists, reproductive health technical experts and youth experts; the project integrated evidence-based practices, and gained cross-sectoral insights to inform the process. Flexibility in systems, reflection on process, and ongoing support from technical and operational experts were prioritized throughout the project’s design and prototyping phases.  To support this effort, PSI Tanzania documented key milestones and operational decisions, including tools that were used during the process such as job descriptions, interview activity guides, scoring forms, and organization charts, market assessment documents, marketing plans, and pilot and implementation plans.  As part of this continuous learning approach, these documents were reviewed semi-annually in partnership with an external evaluator, to inform process, impact, and cost evaluations. Findings of the process evaluation are shared at close of each project phase to inform real-time management, and distill management, structural, and procedural practices to be carried forward in project implementation.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Analysis of the A360 Tanzania management experience during iterative design and prototyping suggest six overarching categories of process considerations to support this work.  1) <em>Staffing &amp; recruiting:</em> Projects undertaking this approach will move through several different structures as they progress, and so must have a team with a wide range of skills to support these various structures. While hiring, we sought qualities in candidates (creativity, open-mindedness, comfort with ambiguity) rather than specific technical experience, which required creative approaches to recruitment. Flexible leave systems also helped to combat burnout in an intensive process. 2) <em>Technical &amp; supervisory advisors: </em>Diverse expertise is needed throughout for co-creation and review, and require formal and informal processes in support. 3) <em>Procurement &amp; cash:</em> Systems must enable teams to access cash for procurements as part of prototyping, while ensuring compliance with policies. 4) <em>Conducive environment</em>: Workspace requirements vary depending on the project phase, and require appropriate spaces that promote collaboration and creativity. Environments that encourage learning, risk-taking and creativity are critical. 5) <em>Preparation &amp; framing:</em> Clear tools and resources aid to frame design opportunities and identify challenges systematically and strategically. Using an analytical approach allowed us to better frame our work, set clear strategic direction, and communicate with stakeholders.  6) <em>Organizational culture &amp; design fidelity:</em> Supportive leadership is critical to enabling risk taking and iterative design. As the project transitioned to implementation, we restructured our team to support operations, helping to maintain an appropriate balance of design fidelity and adaptation for scale as we expanded coverage.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>In recent years, the development community has increasingly prioritized two distinct conversations: 1) the importance of participatory programming that joins with beneficiaries to advance improved outcomes—particularly in the adolescent and youth SRH sector, and 2) adaptive programming capable of recognizing and responding to shifts in implementation and epidemiological contexts. A360’s experience offers a logistical response to both of these conversations. In Tanzania, A360 has identified, analyzed, and addressed many of the traditional structures that have long upheld development programming, but which have also remained indifferent to our global community’s calls for more nimble and responsive program design and management. Today, A360 is working to create global good to help others replicate this process, enabling additional implementers and partners to benefit from the conceptual, structural, and managerial tenets of A360 project design and implementation. As participatory design and adaptive implementation grow as foundational concepts for progress in development, A360 aims to provide a learning site by which others may avoid challenges from adopting and adapting concepts of iterative design and implementation for new settings. Distilling and disseminating effective practices and lessons learned with additional countries and partners will support their preparation for and implementation of similar approaches.  PSI plans to continue sharing tools and lessons learned from implementing its adaptive, iterative process from design through implementation. These tools and lessons will be available for others within and outside of PSI to use in future programs.</p>",

      "title": "Why Brands Matter: A Makeover for AYSRH",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally, 252 million adolescent girls and young women aged 15-19 are sexually active and have unmet need for contraception. Sixteen million adolescents aged 15-19 give birth each year, primarily in low and middle income countries. Misinformation and stigma surrounding sexual and reproductive health (SRH) are pervasive, and pose significant barriers to girls’ access to critical information and services. In highly stigmatized settings, asking a girl to engage with SRH information and services can be akin to asking her to risk reputation, and even personal safety. Among unmarried adolescent girls, use of contraceptives can bring with it social perceptions of sexual activity, promiscuity, and low morale character. Among married adolescents, use of contraceptives can similarly bring perceptions of non-conformity with social norms in which fertility and childbearing are highly valued. In both cases, such scenarios pose challenges to girls’ stability, and thus deterrants to their motivation and ability to access services. Globally, adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health (AYSRH) programs grapple with this challenge: how to build contraceptive awareness and knowledge, align with social norms, and ensure safe and non-biased access to services?   Across diverse countries and health contexts, program branding is a proven tool for social and behavior</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Recognizing the potential for girl-led social marketing to respond to this question, Population Services International (PSI) developed interventions applying a transdisciplinary approach integrating human-centered design:  SmartStart in Ethiopia, Kuwa Mjanja in Tanzania, and 9Ja Girls in Nigeria. Fit to local contexts, these interventions share key brand elements: young brand–visuals, tone, messaging, and an offer and a promise–-leading with what matters to young people and their influencers by piquing interest and inviting them to engage. Looking at these three interventions, you wouldn’t know they had anything to do with contraception. From a branding perspective, that’s the point.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>PSI used human-centered design (HCD) as part of its design methodology across the three countries. A creative approach to problem-solving that starts with people and arrives at solutions tailored to their needs, HCD is premised on empathy - the capacity to step into other people’s shoes, to understand their lives, and start to solve problems from their perspectives.  Recognizing the need to align HCD with the evidence- and theory- bases of other disciplines helping to lead in AYSRH globally, PSI worked to imbue its approach with public health, adolescent developmental science, social marketing, and anthropology. A result was a methodology that included adolescent girls, health system stakeholders, and the natural future “owners” of the interventions not only as data sources for design, but as co-designers and analysts.  Through research and prototyping in 2017 and 2018 in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania, youth-adult teams continually built, tested and iterated toward valid and desirable AYSRH solutions. This collaborative iteration afforded valuable opportunity to rapidly explore, fail, and sense-make to ultimately advance toward solutions grounded in the experiences, needs, and desires of those affecting and effected by adolescent SRH decision-making and outcomes.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>This youth-adult co-design process has yielded unique interventions supported by strong branding.  In Nigeria, 9Ja Girls stands for love, life, and health. A vibrant lipstick-drawn logo links to income generating skills and SRH counseling and services. Positioning contraception girls’ future, the branded mantra “My life is mine to make”, helps the intervention respond to critical adolescent developmental science findings: interventions must connect with youth’s cognitive <em>and</em> emotional decision-making. In Tanzania’s Kuwa Mjanja, a pineapple symbolizes a branded empowerment story,  using a mantra to articulate girls’ powerful self image: “Stand tall (Be proud of who you are), Wear a crown (Know your worth), Be sweet (live in line with your values).”  Finally, SmartStart in Ethiopia is carefully branded to the rural Ethiopian context: recognizing the importance of making contraception familiar and approachable, it adopts traditional colors, print patterns, and symbols of wealth—images depict young couples looking forward to a home, with shade trees and livestock. These branded images align with the intervention’s strategy: financial planning as entré to life and family planning.</p><p>Early piloting results are promising. In six week periods: Kuwa Mjanja reached 7,025 married and unmarried girls through discrete outreach, 79% of all eligible girls (those exposed to the intervention, sexually active, and not currently using a method) have left with a modern method. In Nigeria, 5,652 were reached in this same period and 28% of those eligible left with a contraceptive method. In Ethiopia, 1,041 married girls were reached, and 78% of those eligible adopted a method.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Through these design experiences, the A360 approach has allowed us to learn about the daily realities of navigating adolescence in the three countries—about being young, shaping and nurturing hopes, navigating fears, and pursuing aspirations. By creating brands that lead with what matters to young people, A360 has been able to connect the value of contraception with where girls are in their lives, with girls as partners in the process. This experience offers lessons to the field of AYSRH, suggesting an opportunity to more consistently design for the unique experience of being young—with branding as a tool. Adolescent developmental science has shown that young people make decisions that are based primarily on perceived relevance to their lives, immediacy, and emotional resonance. When done well, brands have the ability to inspire and connect with exactly these experiential elements. In the private sector, branding can be used to introduce a new product, build a customer relationship, and create recognizability and trustworthiness. The most successful brands also tap into our values and identity, and become part of how we see ourselves and express what we care about.  Considering traditional SRH programming, which often medicalizes contraceptive methods and counseling, and leads with technical cognition rather than emotional connection, there is an opportunity to imbue public health practice with this emotional and experiential side of the human experience.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Ghana, the demand for SRH services, especially Family planning services among unmarried sexually active women is 87% with an unmet need of 42 %( GDHS, 2014).Rural young people are the hardest hit due to a complex interaction of socio-cultural barriers that frown and resist the discussion of sexuality among young people and   non - responsive health systems that is not friendly to the SRHR needs of young people due to poor staff attitude, poor siting of health facilities due to a government   policy of sitting health facilities 8km which means most young people do not have immediate access to FP commodities. Non -receipted   fees or illegal charges associated with   FP commodities ranging from an average of 2 cedis (0.50 USD cents) to a maximum of 50 cedis (USD12) continue to serve as critical barriers to young people as majority of people (45.9%) live below USD1 a day(GSS, 2015). A combination of challenges has manifested in the increase in teenage pregnancy from 12.6% in 2014 to 15.5% in 2016(GHS-U/E/R, 2016) in the Upper East Region of Ghana.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In 2016,Social accountability was adopted to empower young people to demand for their SRHR. Key Social accountability tools used included, public hearings, civic education and Youth Friendly Score Cards (YFSC) which was used to assess the youth friendliness of 6 health facilities coupled with regular Interface meetings between young people and health service providers to jointly address critical barriers to Youth Friendly Services .Engagement of relevant community institutions like traditional leaders, Religious leaders , Community Health Management Committees(CHMC), School Management Committees(SMCs) were reached through meetings while community durbars and Radio were the tools of choice for reaching out to communities.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Capacity of youth leaders and peer educators were built on social accountability and the use of the YFSC. The project embarked on a youth led sensitization of young people through community durbars on the use of YFSC and the processes involved.  The institution of the confidant system where young people who cannot read or do not wish to use the YFSC reported their challenges to the youth leaders. Four (4) Half yearly lobby meetings between young people, local health authorities and community leaders was instituted during which critical barriers preventing young people from accessing SRHR services were discussed and joint solutions developed to address these barriers. Key bottlenecks identified included poor staff attitude which led to the capacity building of 20 frontline health staff on YFS and the development of YFS improvement plans for 6 health facilities located in the project communities. The project also initiated dialogue with  of over 100 traditional and religious leaders to gather support for the SRHR of young people and health staff instituted SRHR outreach for young people, focused SRH services for young people and the institution of regular follow-up for young people with special SRHR needs like HIV, STI and victims of SGBV</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The 6 Health facilities in the project areas begun to actively capture, store appropriately and retrieve data on young people accessing SRH services which was remarkable departure from previous experiences where data was virtually not retrievable in these health facilities. Health facilities also adopted ways to break the barriers of distance due to the policy of siting health facilities 8km apart by instating outreach SRH services for young people, focused SRH services and follow-up systems for young people with special SRH needs like HIV and post abortion care. Despite the fact that health infrastructure was constructed without much recourse to the needs of young people, local health authorities begun to find cost effective innovative ways like giving priority to young people, booking special appointment and adopting 24 hour services to ensure that health facilities are safe environments for young people. Notices were placed displaying approved services charges for FP commodities and other exempted SRH services. Clients were also encouraged to demand official receipts for all monies payed for SRH services. Traditional authorities and schools became more supportive of Sexuality education for young people with young people invited to traditional meetings to discuss their SRH issues. Data from health facilities indicate the utilization of SRH services increased three fold from 8,057 in 2016 to 21,647 in 2017 with females accounting for 78% of the services. Male condoms requested at health contact points by young people also quadrupled from 916 in 2016 to 3,573 in 2017.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Three key lessons emerge which include: (1) Creating space for innovation and actively supporting it is very crucial to breaking barriers within the health systems. Innovations of SRH outreach young people, Special follow-up and focus care obviously bridged the gap of access to SRH services by young people who do not live around health facilities. This also helped service providers overcome the challenges that come with the policy of siting health facilities within an 8km radius. Secondly, current health infrastructure did not take into consideration current issues like youth corners etc, however it is possible to adapt operations to make clinic environments more friendly to young people (2) Integrating of Health management information systems will be very crucial to sustaining interest in youth friendly services. For instance the current priority to Ghana is the maternal and child health interventions. Reporting on these indicators is very crucial to health authorities hence the adaption of these tools to reflect YFS/ SRHR for young people will sustain interest in youth programing as it becomes part of the criteria for performance. (3) Active involvement of young people is very critical to addressing the health needs of young people. Meaningful participation of young people in the planning of health care services and infrastructure can drastically reduce health systems and cost barriers to SRH services as they will be empowered and able to hold service providers accountable</p>",

      "title": "\"Adolescent-friendly\" approaches to improve access to voluntary family planning in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Increasing access to family planning (FP), HIV counseling and testing (HCT), and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment services for at-risk female adolescents is critical to improving socio-economic and health outcomes for women and society. In Uganda, adolescent females aged 15-19 have a high pregnancy rate (25%), low mCPR (21%), and high unmet need for FP (30%). In addition to risks for early/unintended pregnancy, HIV prevalence among youth 15-24 is 4%.  These statistics suggest more can be done to increase adolescent access to FP and HIV/STI prevention and treatment services. Funded by DFID since July of 2017, Marie Stopes International Uganda (MSIU) has sought to address these disparities by narrowing the eligibility of an existing, broadly-targeted youth voucher program to female adolescents age 15-19.  The program uses community-based peer educators (PEs) to provide information about preventing pregnancy, HIV, and STI to adolescents and a free voucher to link them to a suite of integrated HIV, STI, and HCT services provided by MSIU’s BlueStar social franchise clinics. This presentation will highlight the results of an evaluation that examined the extent to which MSIU’s program is appropriately optimized to reach, engage, and serve adolescents.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The evaluation objective was to examine how structural program components, environmental and social factors, and attitudes toward FP affects adolescent participation in the program. The evaluation focused on three program components: the peer education approach, voucher distribution, and FP counseling and services provided to voucher users. This presentation will present results for three research questions: </p><ul>\t<li>What strategies do PEs use to reach and engage adolescents and what makes some strategies more successful than others?</li>\t<li>Do adolescents require different outreach and counseling approaches compared to older youth?</li>\t<li>In what ways does the program support informed decision-making among adolescents?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>Abt Associates independently examined the program features and mechanisms using a qualitative design. Data collection consisted of focus group discussions (FDGs) with BlueStars, PEs, and adolescents not engaged by the program (n=7; n=10; n=7, respectively) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 28 adolescent voucher redeemers. All adolescent participants were females aged 15-19. Data collection was implemented in December 2017 in 22 of 29 districts where MSIU currently implements its program. All active BlueStars and PEs were invited to participate in an FGD. IDI participants were randomly selected for recruitment from lists of voucher users stratified by region and service(s) provided. Youth-serving organizations working in the same districts as MSIU assisted with the recruitment of unengaged adolescents. Discussions were audio recorded in the local language and subsequently transcribed and translated into English for thematic analysis. During analysis, researchers used grounded theory to construct and support hypotheses, while paying attention to negative cases and considering alternative explanations. A codebook was developed a priori and evolved iteratively as coders identified new themes and concepts in the transcripts. To ensure consistency, three researchers triple-coded 10% of transcripts. Appropriate local and international IRB approvals were received.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<ul>\t<li>All stakeholders acknowledged that adolescents’ lack of maturity and legal, cultural, and financial independence makes it difficult to obtain accurate information about FP; as a result adolescent perceptions are greatly shaped by social norms regarding adolescent sexuality and misconceptions held by peers and parents around the risks of contraceptive use.</li>\t<li>Although PEs had moderate success reaching adolescents in locations where youth of all ages socialize or work, adolescents require additional and more intensive outreach approaches. This included door-to-door outreach and school-based health talks.  </li>\t<li>Compared to outreach with older youth (20-24), PEs often had to develop networks of community partners to better locate and reach adolescents. Networks included social workers, local council members, religious leaders, youth-focused NGOs, and village health teams.  </li>\t<li>PEs also directly engaged adolescents’ parents, teachers, and employers. Because these adult influencers can potentially exert a high degree of influence over adolescent decision-making they require modified sensitization strategies to effectively support adolescent informed voluntary access to FP. PEs noted the need for improved strategies to help them address situations when parent-adolescent intentions were not aligned.</li>\t<li>Since adolescents demanded detailed FP information during outreach, PEs noted that they needed to provide more in-depth FP counseling than originally intended by MSIU to be credible in their work.</li>\t<li>When PEs and providers used strategies to build trust, maintain confidentiality, enhance privacy, and resolve misconceptions, adolescents felt empowered to select from the full range of long- and short-acting FP methods available to them.</li>\t<li>Unengaged adolescents independently validated PE's modified outreach and interaction approaches as desired and \"adolescent-friendly\". </li></ul>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Empowering adolescents to make informed decisions on FP at this stage in their life can positively impact and support future health decision-making in an environment where they may otherwise be marginalized. Programs need strategies for how to better inform and sensitize community stakeholders, adult influencers, and partners in a way that simultaneously galvanizes community support for adolescent health, and empowers adolescents to make informed and voluntary choices to use a voucher.</p><p>Since parents, teachers, employers, and other adult inflencers can exert a great deal of influence over adolescents decision-making, programs working with adolescents should identify opportunities to engage these stakeholders throughout program development and implementation to ensure that communities  are a part of the solution to expand adolescent access to FP information and services.</p><p>Because there is a risk that improperly implemented counseling and outreach can perpetuate misconceptions and create or reinforce situations where the decision to accept and use a voucher is primarily motivated by an external influencer rather than the adolescent themselves, future efforts should ensure training for PEs can position them be able to satisfy curious, information-seeking adolescents in a manner that complements comprehensive clinical counseling. </p><p>Adolescent-friendly outreach, counseling, and service provision approaches can improve access to comprehensive information on FP, HCT, and STIs, which strengthens an adolescent’s ability to make informed and voluntary choices about their health. Further research is warranted on the impact of adolescent-friendly program practices on FP uptake, method choice, as well as other key adolescent reproductive health and empowerment outcomes.</p>",

      "title": "How and why do vouchers increase uptake of Sexual and Reproductive Health Services among adolescents in Kenya?",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Kenya, adolescents aged 15-19 constitute 24% of population. Many experience sexual and reproductive health (SRH) problems: one in every five is pregnant or has a child (Kenya Demographic Health Survey - KDHS 2014); they suffer high rates of unsafe abortions; and their maternal mortality rate is twice as high as older age groups (Ministry of Health 2018). Adolescents face a myriad of barriers accessing SRH services on both the demand- and supply side. Apart from lack of financial means, girls lack practical information, have insufficient knowledge of contraceptives; feel disempowered and have concerns about confidentiality. On the supply-side, providers are often unwilling to provide SRH services to adolescents, with fears of legal implications or parental disapproval. Providers have insufficient experience and knowledge on how to provide quality adolescents’ SRH services and make their clinic youth-friendly. Health vouchers are both a financing mechanism to improve equity, as well as a programmatic tool to reduce access barriers on both the supply- and demand-side and increase use of critical services. Vouchers – paper voucher and/or e-code or other token – can be distributed to target populations who exchange them for services at accredited health providers. Providers are paid for each voucher redeemed. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In 2016 Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK) initiated a multi-component youth programme. In one component, providers from it’s socially franchised (SF) private provider network (“AMUA”) are trained in youth-friendly services. In selected AMUA clinics vouchers are implemented. Clinics are selected using a programme tool assessing youth-friendliness. MSK is the voucher management agency. The voucher package enables recipients to access multiple services including counselling, short- and long-acting contraceptives (STMs/LARCs), pregnancy tests, STI services, follow-up consultations and LARC removal. Vouchers are distributed by community health volunteers (CHVs) who receive a performance based payment for each voucher used. Providers and CHW are paid monthly.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The AMUA SF network currently comprises 338 clinics spread across Kenya, the majority being situated in peri-urban and rural areas. Vouchers are implemented in 124 AMUA clinics in Nairobi, Coast, Central and Western regions. After a small pilot in Nairobi the voucher programme started in April 2017 and quickly scaled to the 124 voucher clinics in four months. Distributors collect beneficiary data and send these to a web-based voucher platform using a smartphone and obtaining a unique e-code which is written on the paper voucher. At the service delivery point, the provider validates the e-code through SMS and after service provision reports services to the platform using SMS. Service data obtained from the voucher platform and the AMUA Information System were analysed using descriptive statistics. The average monthly proportion of adolescent clients in the 12 months preceding the voucher programme is compared with the 10 months post-initiation, and these data are also compared with the 214 AMUA clinics not participating (‘controls’). Use of implants by adolescents is also compared between voucher clinics and control clinics. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The monthly average proportion of clients being an adolescent in AMUA clinics participating in the voucher scheme quadrupled: from on average 8% in the 12 months before vouchers started to 34% in the subsequent ten months. In control clinics, these proportions remained almost the same, respectively 7% and 9%. Almost all increases observed in participating AMUA clinics were due to vouchers users: the number of fee-paying adolescents remained almost the same. In absolute numbers, the average number of adolescents making use of SRH services in the whole AMUA channel in Kenya increased from around 1,500 adolescent clients per month in the 12 months before the voucher programme started to 7,300 each month in the 10 months post-initiation. 84% of voucher users had never previously used contraceptives. Most voucher users were single (89%) and had no children (75%). Vouchers also expanded the contraceptive method choice. Implants are expensive for adolescents and while 61% of voucher users accessed an implant, in the control clinics only 32% choose an implant. However, both proportions are still high when compared with 6% use of implants among sexually active unmarried adolescents reported by KDHS 2014. Seven percent of adolescents used their voucher for IUD, again high when compared with 0% reported in the KDHS; 11% to access injectables and only 2% to obtain pills.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Vouchers successfully increased SRH uptake and enabled a new group – sexually active unmarried adolescents – to access services, a group which usually faces many access barriers. Vouchers are hypothesized to not only reduce financial barriers but also other barriers on both the supply- and demand-side. Results of Kenya vouchers support this assumption. Voucher-income motivates providers to improve quality and respond better to clients’ needs, a process which is strengthened when combined with SF. On the demand-side, vouchers break down financial, informational, educational, and cultural barriers and empower youth to access services. MSK identified factors for success: providers overcoming fear and gaining skills to counsel adolescents; motivated by voucher-income, facilities created youth spaces, expanded opening-hours, organised health talks at schools and youth events; trusted CHVs provided face-to-face counselling; performance-based payments motivated CHVs to involve community leaders, organise mobilisation activities and escort adolescents to clinics. The paper voucher itself empowered and was a discreet way to avoid explaining reason of clinic-visit (highly appreciated). In terms of sustainability, vouchers promoted sustainable change in health-seeking behaviour; when more adolescents experience contraceptive benefits, community awareness and acceptance increases; and unintended pregnancies reduce. While some research has noted potential fraud with vouchers the electronic voucher management system meant that fraud was quickly visible and controlled easily through an appropriate monitoring framework. Lastly, vouchers are a precursor towards health insurance; currently the national health insurance is looking at coverage of school-going adolescents, while MSK assists in developing youth-friendly accreditation criteria and an appropriate benefit package.</p>",

      "title": "Increasing postpartum FP uptake among first-time young parents through an integrated RMNH approach: Lessons from a proof-of-concept in Madagascar",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Globally, 13 million adolescents give birth annually and account for 11% of all births. Health consequences of early pregnancy and birth include increased maternal mortality risk and higher risk of neonatal and child mortality. Rapid repeat pregnancy increases risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, and newborn death. Yet use of reproductive, maternal, and newborn health (RMNH), including antenatal care (ANC), safe delivery, postpartum, and family planning (FP) services, is often lowest among adolescent mothers. A clear need for interventions to connect pregnant and parenting youth to health services exists. Yet globally, few models for reaching first-time young parents (FTYPs) exist; most youth programs focus on delaying marriage/first pregnancy and do not target those who have started childbearing. Further, scant evidence exists on the broad RMNH needs of FTYPs. Existing programs targeting FTYPs have focused mainly on increasing their FP use.  In Madagascar, 39% of women begin childbearing before age 19, and only 7.5% of adolescents aged 15-19 use a modern method of contraception, compared to 23% among women 15-49. An approach to engage FTYPs and their key influencers to increase health service use was developed based on formative research and tested in two districts.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The <em>Tanora Mitsinjo Tanaraka</em> (TMT, \"young people looking after their legacy\") was launched in  2017. TMT aims to increase RMNH service use by FTYPs through a socioecological approach. Health providers in 11 facilities are supported to provide youth-responsive RMNH and postpartum FP (PPFP) services. Pregnant/parenting youth aged 10-24 and their partners receive home visits and participate in group discussions led by trained 75 community health workers (CHWs), using a simple booklet to provide life-course-tailored information about pregnancy, delivery preparedness, newborn care, and PPFP. CHWs provide an invitation card to encourage service use and hold community discussions with potential influencers.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Formative research explored individual, couple, family, community, and system level influences via health service data; focus group discussions (FGDs) with FTYPs who did not use services; their parents/kin, and CHWs; in-depth interviews (IDIs) with FTYPs who used services, influential adults, and health providers; and health facility assessments.</p><p>Findings informed the TMT approach in collaboration with diverse stakeholders representing the Ministries of Health, Education, Population, Communication, and Youth. As TMT is a new approach with global implications, the program design included a clear learning agenda from the outset, with a rigorous implementation science approach embedded throughout implementation.  Service statistics from supported facilities are routinely reviewed to identify changes in use of RMNH and PPFP services by clients aged 10-24. Ongoing learning and reflection meetings with CHWs and health workers review monitoring data, including service statistics and distribution/return of invitation cards, explore successes and promising practices, and identify challenges and need for mid-course improvement. To create an enabling policy environment, the 2018-2020 National Strategic Plan for Adolescents and Youth includes FTYPs as a priority population. A planned end-of-project learning and review exercise will identify outcomes and program lessons through FGDs with CHWs and FTYPs, and IDIs with health providers and government stakeholders.</p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Formative research confirmed that approaches to increase service use by FTYPs must ensure that health services are responsive to the needs of young people in general — and FTYPs in particular — and engage influential individuals, particularly mothers, mothers-in-law, and community leaders.   Service linkages must be fostered early in pregnancy, and health facility interactions must be positive, to ensure continued use of ANC and facility-based delivery services and encourage PPFP uptake by FTYPs. CHWs, trusted and respected sources of information for both FTYPs and their influencers and providers of short-acting FP methods at the community level, are an important platform for reaching FTYPs and influencers.</p><p>Monitoring data show that CHWs distributed 1,989 invitation cards to young parents between July 2017 and January 2018, and 72% (1,430) of invitation cards distributed to young parents by CHWs resulted in visits to the health facility. Monthly community-based provision of short-acting contraceptive methods to clients aged 10 to 24 increased from an average of 35 clients per CHW in July 2017 to 76 in January 2018. In supported health facilities, the total numbers of FP clients aged 10-24 increased from 3,035 in July 2017 to 3,451 in December 2017.</p><p>The learning exercise to be conducted in June 2018 will review the perceptions of CHWs, health care providers, and FTYPs about the project design, what elements of the design contributed to the substantial increase in service use, and ways the design could be adapted for the future.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>TMT fills a global gap in programs that address FTYPs’ limited RMNH service use with the goal of avoiding rapid repeat pregnancy and promoting best practices in RMNH. Formative research findings underscore the importance of a socio-ecological approach, extending beyond health system strengthening to engage those who influence FTYP service use and health care practices.</p><p></p><p>Lessons from review meetings confirm that it is strategic to integrate activities with FTYPs into capacity-building for RMNH service strengthening approaches. While tailoring services to meet the needs of FTYPs may require extra efforts, health workers are motivated because they see the connection between attracting more FTYPs and achieving targeted reductions in adverse RMNH outcomes. FTYPs desire to space births, but the concept of PPFP is new for CHWs and FTYPs in Madagascar. Invitation cards provide important motivation for FTYPs and CHWs; the attractive cards make FTYPs feel important and valued, and CHWs appreciate comparisons of numbers of cards distributed versus returned at the facility to gage the success of their efforts. Reviewing monitoring data during learning meetings confirms to health providers and CHWs that their work is important and that reported data are useful for informing program adjustments. Program experience shows that early stakeholder engagement is essential to clarifying the rationale for focusing on FTYPs and alleviating concerns that such a focus may incentivize early childbearing. Programs must continue to build FP clinical skills and ensure contraceptive availability.</p><p></p><p>This session will also include results and programmatic lessons from the planned end-of-project data collection.</p>",

      "title": "A Community Couples Approach To Family Planning Programming in Bihar, India: A Case Study of Couple-to-Couple Engagement for Improved Family Planning Practices",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Per India’s National Family Health Survey 2015-16 (NFHS-4), the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) in Bihar is 23%, 6 percentage points lower than Bihar’s mCPR in 2005-6 (NFHS-3, 29%). Female sterilization, usually after the birth of more than 3 children, remains the most popular method of family planning (FP). Rigid social norms and limited male engagement in FP programs are two major obstacles to increasing the mCPR in Bihar. With funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Project Concern International (PCI)/India is implementing the JEEViKA Technical Support Program (JTSP) which works with 170,000 Self-Help Groups across 11 districts in Bihar. Within JTSP, PCI is rolling out a pilot study to test the efficacy of a couple-to-couple approach to increasing demand for and adoption of modern family planning (FP) methods. The primary purpose of this paper is to showcase an innovative Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) approach that uses a community resource pool of couples (CRP Couple) to mobilize and engage men and women (couples) in small group discussions that address social, interpersonal, and individual barriers to adopting modern family planning methods, including by augmenting aspirations for family well-being and stimulating informed, couple-centric decision-making over family size.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>PCI works with communities to identify and build capacity of CRP Couples to raise awareness of the benefits of smaller families and positively change FP practices. The CRP Couple enlists eligible married couples, identifies their specific needs, discusses the range of modern FP methods available, and facilitates access to service providers. Engagement includes couple-to-couple interaction and separate women’s and men’s meetings. The capacities of the CRP Couple are built around interpersonal communication, individual counselling, and group interaction and engagement. Selecting married couples from within target communities as facilitators strategically positions men as both agents of change and supportive partners.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The intervention was staggered using two phases – formative and pilot. In the formative phase, through iterative processes, the SBCC tools and program protocol were developed. In the six-month pilot phase beginning in December 2017, all 11,628 households were mapped across the intervention areas – a catchment of 60 Angwanwadi Centres in the Morwa block of the Samastipur district. All currently married women of reproductive age were identified and assessed for sterilization, hysterectomy, and long-term infertility. A total of 4,224 currently married women and their husbands were recruited into the intervention. A quasi-experimental evaluation design will be used to measure the efficacy of program impact. The design includes two rounds of representative quantitative cross-sectional surveys across intervention and comparison groups selected from similar geographies. The baseline survey was conducted prior to the pilot phase which began in November 2017; the endline survey will be conducted in July 2018.  A team of trained female investigators interviewed 1200 women from both intervention and comparison groups. Post baseline, a house-listing operation was carried out by 30 couples hired from within project communities who have at least functional literacy and strong dedication to working for the benefit of their own community.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The MIS during the formative phase, conducted between October 2016 and January 2017 among 1398 currently married fecund women not currently using a permanent method of contraception, showed an increase from 13.3% to 26.2% in modern family planning method use, with substantial increase in the adoption of several modern short-term methods. Use of condoms increased from 5% to 9.25%, oral contraceptive pills from 3.4% to 7.8%, and injectable contraceptives from 2.7% to 4.19%.  Documentation of group reflections during men’s meetings in formative phase suggest that male participants became more open to discussing FP issues and responded more positively to improved FP practices adopted by their female partners.  Since the pilot phase remains on-going, the efficacy of the approach will be established upon completion of the end-line survey in July 2018. Post house-listing, 30 CRP Couples began their community outreach activities in mid-January 2018. Within the first three months, the CRP Couples made 12,267 outreach visits and met with a total of 3,676 women (in most instances, along with their husbands), aligning with the targets established in the project protocol.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>While traditionally in India the role of demand generation for FP has rested with female frontline health workers, this FP pilot explores a novel approach of using CRP Couples to address social norms, improve couple communication, and increase the adoption of modern family planning methods. Women in the CRP Couple are also members of well-established self-help groups, of which female beneficiaries of this pilot are also members. Hence, the credibility of the female CRP Couples was already established. The establishment of the male half of the CRP Couple, however, introduces a new community-based entrant who plays a vital role in FP behaviour change. Engaging men as change agents has provided a critical space and opportunity for dialoguing with and among beneficiary couples. Sensitizing men to the individual and family benefits of FP has resulted in an increased likelihood of couples communicating with one another on the topic of FP.  Because the CRP Couple increases awareness, fosters positive inter-spousal communication, and encourages a family centric understanding and more equitable and joint decision-making processes, men engaged more positively and supportively in FP discussions with their wives, establishing men not only as change agents but as partners in behaviour change. The separate interactions within the men’s and women’s groups also helped to shift social norms, encourage peer learning, and increase the acceptability of and demand for various modern family planning methods. Lastly, establishing linkages with service providers encouraged behaviour change by increasing access to FP counselling, method choice, and follow-up support. </p>",

      "title": "Concordant and Discordant report of Contraceptive Use by couples and its Association with Marital Relations and Men’s attitude: Evidence from India, NFHS 2015-16.",
      "significanceBackground": "Inspite of vociferous promotion of family planning to reduce TFR, the contraceptive prevalence rate in India has reduced in the last 10 years as evident from the recent round of Indian demographic Health Survey (NFHS 4). Moreover, family planning methods in India is dominated by use of female centric measures, especially female sterilization; whereas male methods use is around 10 % (CPR of male sterilization has reduced to 0.3 from 1 in NFHS 4). Further it is revealed that in NFHS 4 prevalence of concordant couple report of contraceptive use/ non use is 53% which includes 36 % non users. This hints at limited male involvement in family planning in India wherein women are burdened with the sole responsibility of contraception to ensure better reproductive health choices. Research has frequently documented socio demographic correlates of contraceptive use, but influence of relationship indicators in contraceptive adoption is limited. In settings of gender inequality, men play a crucial role in adoption of contraception; thus in patriarchal India influence of husband’s attitude on contraceptive use could be significant. Family planning promoters have always tried to include men, therefore couple level analysis of contraceptive use will help in formulating specific policies to address them.",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The paper tries to understand the level of concordant and discordant contraceptive use among couples and to determine whether and how this concordant or discordant usage and non usage of contraceptive methods are influenced by marital relations (control and violence) and men’s attitude.</p>",
      "methodology": "The paper utilizes couple data from National family Health Survey 2015-16 (Indian DHS). The sample comprises 38865 couples who are in monogamous marriages, wives have completed the domestic violence module and are currently not pregnant. Marital relations include the marital control and marital violence. Marital control is categorised as no co control and some control. Marital violence includes ever experience of emotional violence, moderate physical violence, severe physical violence and sexual violence. Husband’s attitude includes attitude about contraception being women’s business, or use of contraception means promiscuous woman, wife beating justification, justification for wife’s refusal of sex and justification of men’s adverse behaviour in the event of refusal of sex by wife.The dependent variable of concordant/ discordant current contraceptive use by couple is categorised as concordant non usage, discordant usage, concordant usage and covert use (women’s usage, but husband’s report of non usage). Discordant usage includes couples who have reported different contraceptive methods and also those where husband reported method use but wife reported non use.Bivariate analyses were done to find out the prevalence of contraceptive use and further multinomial regression was used to determine the influence of marital relations and men’s attitude on current concordant/discordant contraceptive use.",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "Preliminary findings reveal that covert use of contraception is 37% and there are approximately 33 % concordant non contraceptive users. In comparison concordant usage of contraception is a mere 19%. Cohen’s Kappa was run to ascertain the level of concordance between husband and wife’s type of contraceptive method use. Kappa value of 0.29 reveals poor concordance between them. Prevalence of covert contraceptive use is more for women who have marital control as against those who have no marital control (39% versus 36%).  Similarly covert use of contraceptive is more among women who have faced marital violence, be it physical, emotional and sexual. Concordance in contraceptive use is more prevalent in women who have no marital control or marital violence in their marital relations.Results reveal that men who think that contraception is women business, the covert use of contraception is more prevalent as against men who disagree to it(41% versus 34%). Justification of wife’s refusal of sex which denotes egalitarian attitude increases concordance in contraceptive usage while men who justify wife beating and use of adverse measure when wife refuses sex increases covert use prevalence among them. Results from multinomial regression after adjusting for socio demographic characteristics reveal that the predicted probability of covert usage is more when women face violence and control in marital relations, and when husband’s think contraceptive is women business and also for men having gender biased notions about sexual relations or wife beating. Predicted probability also increases for non usage when men have gender biased attitude.",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Given the context that contraceptie use has reduced in the past 10 years India needs to increase modern spacing method and cut down its reliance on female sterilization. For achieving this goal men should be integrated into family planning policies. This study has highlighted the fact that there exists considerable use of contraception, probably without the knowledge of the husbands (covert use), and very limited concordant contraceptive users. As evident from this research, to increase non usage as well as concordant usage, it is essential to foster better marital relations and egalitarian gender role attitudes. Contraception usage should be a joint decision but considerable amount of covert users imply that contraception is still a woman's prerogative in India.</p>",

      "title": "Emanzi – a proven affective male engagement intervention designed for scale-up",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Research shows that men are highly influential over a couple’s reproductive health decisions and the family’s health care-seeking behavior. However, the deeply embedded ideas about appropriate gender roles and myths and misconceptions on family planning (FP) pose obstacles to male support for and participation in FP services. This is of major concern in Uganda, where the total fertility rate, at 5.4 births per woman in 2017, remains one of the highest in eastern and southern Africa. The low modern contraceptive prevalence rate of 35 percent among married women is further exacerbated by inequitable social and gender norms and gender-based violence. FHI 360 developed Emanzi using our Research Utilization Framework, which emphasizes building on evidence-based interventions, dynamic feedback, and iterative processes. Emanzi is modelled after the evidence-based Men as Partners curriculum. Emanzi was first evaluated by FHI 360 in 2013 and adapted based on evaluation results. Adaptations include a greater focus on simplified key messages, healthy relationships and scalability. Session include: “Understanding Gender Roles and Stereotypes”, “Understanding Violence Against Women”, “Healthy Timing and Spacing of Pregnancy and FP Methods.” Evaluated in 2017, FHI 360 found that participants’ attitudes towards gender norms improved significantly and was found to have had lasting improvements.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>FHI 360 implemented an evidence-based intervention in three districts to improve reproductive and sexual health outcomes by promoting men's constructive engagement in health. The intervention, Emanzi, aims to: improve relationship quality between women and men, increase communication about sexuality and health between women and men, and promote shared decision making between women and men. Emanzi is designed for scale-up. There are nine 60 minute sessions facilitated by community health workers (CHWs) trained in Emanzi. Emanzi focuses on healthy relationships, more so than public health (e.g., FP, HIV) and has role play and group discussions.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Emanzi was implemented by FHI 360 in three districts of Uganda with more than 3,000 men aged 18-45 years having completed the intervention from 2015-2017. A quantitative evaluation of the program was conducted in seven communities in Kasese district with approximately 250 men and their partners. They were followed over a period of nine months in 2016-2017. Using the gender equitable men (GEM) scale to measure gender norms, men were asked a series of questions related to gender norms, gender based violence, sexuality, masculinities, and reproductive health. The GEM scale measured items on a 3-point Likert scale (agree, partially agree, disagree) and was scored so that a greater score was equal to more support for gender equitable beliefs. Men’s attitudes towards gender norms were assessed using a survey questionnaire pre- and post-intervention (~3 and 6 months). A qualitative assessment was conducted in Kanungu district two years after the first group of Emanzi participants graduated. This assessment aimed to understand the factors that led to the continuation of Emanzi activities and income generating activities (IGAs) that started organically by participants following curriculum completion. Data collection consisted of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions with implementers and beneficiaries, both men and women.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The quantitative analysis found men’s attitudes towards gender norms improved from pre-to post-intervention. The mean predicted value of GEM score was 2.23 at baseline and increased an average of 0.41 points between baseline and 3 months (interim) (95% CI:[0.36,0.46]). The GEM scores continued to increase between interim and endline (6 months) by an average 0.08 (95% CI:[0.02,0.14]). This statistically significant finding demonstrates men retained information from Emanzi and it had lasting improvements on gender equitable attitudes. The shared decision-making score captured the extent somebody makes decisions in partnership with their partner. Emanzi participants and their partner’s attitudes towards shared household decision making increased significantly at interim, (95% CI:[0.21,0.29]) and (95% CI:[0.08,0.16]), respectively; men’s scores continued to increase slightly at endline. Emanzi participants and their partners use of FP increased from baseline to interim. The increase was statistically significant among men (95% CI:[1.46,3.6]), suggesting that participating in Emanzi improved FP use. Mens use of FP 6 months after Emanzi continued to increase, although not significant. The qualitative analysis supports these findings. Participants reported improved communication and cooperation after completing Emanzi. Some men reported increased communication with wives about finances, joint budgeting and savings, and paying for school fees. Almost all participants mentioned men engaging in discussions with their partners about FP. Some groups wanted to continue to meet and discuss gender topics and start IGAs. IGAs reported during the evaluation included rearing chickens, pigs and rabbits and/or pooling funds for household goods and school fees. Forty Emanzi groups continued meeting post-intervention.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The success of Emanzi reaffirms the importance of social-norm change models and small group engagement approaches to improve health outcomes, especially for reproductive health and FP. Additionally using FHI 360’s RU approach was critical to ensure this approach was built on strong research and could result in lasting change. FHI 360 aimed to create an improved program that could be scaled up across Uganda. The evaluation showed Emanzi had a lasting effect on improving gender norms, couples decision making and FP use. FHI 360 found that using existing health system’s structure, such as CHWs, is critical to acceptance of new beliefs and behaviors, and to long-term sustainability. The intervention has been packaged and has been used by other bi-lateral partners working in Uganda. Another key finding was that Emanzi naturally links to socio-economics at the community and household level. Emanzi stimulated men in all three districts where it was implemented to begin IGAs to increase their household income. IGAs were not part of the curriculum. FHI 360 plans to incorporate findings from the evaluations, such as adding a module on savings groups and IGAs. These types of activities can help sustain the normative change movement beyond the intervention.</p>",

      "title": "From Barriers to Champions: Men take lead in Advocating for Healthy Timing and Spacing of Pregnancy and Family Planning in West Pokot County Kenya",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>West Pokot County has the second highest fertlity rate in the country at 7.2% as compared to the national fertility rate of 4.9% whilst its modern contraceptive prevalence rate  is at 14.2% based on the Kenya Demographic Health Survey 2014. World Vision Kenya is implementing a family planning and immunization integration project which is a high impact practice to offer family planning and immunazation at the same location at the same time to ensure that all mothers attending immunization clinics are counselled on family planning. The project before its incepction carried out a barrier analysis to find out the barriers hindering women from taking up a family planning method. Of the 380 women interviewed, 75% of them identified their husbands( men) as their greatest barrier to voluntarily take up a method. Men in this pastoralist community are considered the key decision makers and their wives would need their consent to agree to be on a family planning method. On the other hand, of the 132 men interviewed during barrier analysis, 54.5% of them identified lack of accurate information as the reason why they did not allow their wives to receive a modern family planning method.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p> The program therefore, through consultations with community leaders identified the use of 50 male champions as the best approach to mentor and sensitize other men on the importance of Health Timing and Spacing of Pregnancy(HTSP) and Family Planning (FP). The criteria used to identify the male champions were that the men must have spaced, delayed or limited their pregnancies as well as be resceptable men in the community willing to mentor their peers. The identified male champions were then  capacity built by Ministry of Health workers on the importance and benefits of HTSP and FP.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The 52 male champions( two per village), were taken through a three day sensitization forum, tailored for men that focused on examining cultural beliefs regarding family planning as well as demystifying myths and misconceptions around contraceptive use and  change of negative attitudes. The Ministry of Health also built capacity of men as agents of change to their families and communities to sensitize their peers to support the use of contraception to improve birth spacing. Information about maternal and child health and Healthy Timing and Spacing of Pregnancies and Family Planning was presented in a simple and participatory way through flip chats, skits, case studies and personal testimonies. The four key messages of HTSP were directly linked to health outcomes for mothers and children. The male champions were then responsible for holding sensitization forums once a month at the village level at  men only forums to mentor other men to support their spouses in making informed decisions on their method of choice. The men then approached a local radio station to hold a weekly ' men only' talk show in conjuction with the Ministry of Health to discuss HTSP from a men perspective as well as reach a wider audinece beyond the villages</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The use of male champions has helped men to understand and value HTSP/ FP. The men are taking lead in advocating for birth spacing through openly talking to each other about maternal child health services including immunization, health fertility and methods of contraception that will help them improve health outcomes and strengthen their familieas and communities. The use of male champions has also helped men to disucss gender equality and thus push for couples to go for counselling together to make informed decisions on their reproductive health needs. The male champions continue to hold 'men only' sensitization forums as well a weekly radio talk show that is so popular that the radio station gave the show two slots a week during prime time hour. During the weekly show, an average of 12,000 listeners tune in of which 10,000 are men. They participate in discussions by calling and texting with further questions and clarifications needed from a health proffessional or a male champion. To date a total of 13,973 men have been reached through the sensitization forums and radio shows with a total of 3806 women accepting a modern method as a result of being escorted by their husbands to the health facility for FP counselling.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>One of the most critical lessons learnt for this program is that men appreciate being involved in health matters but actually lack the accurate information needed to make informed decisions. Over 50 % of men the program interviewed during the barrier analysis identfied lack of knowledge on benefits of HTSP and FP as the  key barrier to them not supporting their spouses to accept a modern method. Another lesson learnt is that men are best targeted at locations that men prefer to spend time. For example, the male champions would have to go to men only spots to find a large group of men to hold discussions with. Thirdly, the messages used during the sensitization forums had to be relatable to the men inorder for them to understand the benefits of HTSP and FP. Initially the project used messaging emphasizing that HTSP and FP would benefit the health and mother of the child but we found that this messaging did not resonate well with men. The program then changed the messaging to emphasize the economic burden of not spacing and limiting children and this quickly resonated with the men. Therefore to gain an entry point the male champions used the economic burden messaging and then gradually transitioned to give a more wholistic over view of the benefits of HTSP and FP not only to the mother and child but to the entire community.</p>",

      "title": "Gaps and Opportunities in Counseling Couples: A systematic review of couples counseling interventions in sexual and reproductive health",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Over the last two decades, increased efforts have been directed toward engaging men in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) interventions. Parallel evidence has also reaffirmed that gender norms  affect couples’ reproductive intentions and family planning (FP) decisions (Hawkes and Buse 2013; IRH 2013; Barker et al. 2007). Yet to date, FP programming remains almost exclusively centered around women. The FP2020 plan aims to expand access and use of contraceptives to 120 million women by 2020, but omits mention of men, and more specifically couples, from these efforts. </p><p>Some experts have argued that increased attention should be given to understanding couple dynamics in SRH decision-making, rather than focusing on women and/or men exclusively (Becker, Heise, Shattuck). One proposed space is the use of couples counseling, or the delivery of FP counseling services directly to couples. Several systematic reviews, primarily from the HIV/AIDS field, have suggested that couples counseling approaches may be effective in improving SRH outcomes of participating women and men (Becker 1996; Burton, Darbes, and Operario 2010). To examine the evidence base in the FP field, Georgetown University’s Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) conducted a systematic review of couples counseling (CC) interventions with an emphasis on SRH outcomes.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>As part of the couples counseling review design, we developed a set of research questions that guided our review design and methodology. These included:</p><ul>\t<li>What is the state of the evidence on couples counseling specifically related to family planning?</li>\t<li>What can we learn from couples counseling in the HIV/AIDS and other SRH fields that could be applied to counseling in family planning? </li>\t<li>In what ways do the reviewed papers highlight issues related to reproductive empowerment, informed choice and woman’s autonomy, and joint decision-making around FP?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted electronic searches for peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 1990 and 2016 through Google Scholar, Popline, PubMed, and USAID Development Clearing House. Search terms included “couple”, “couples”, “partner”, “men”, “married women”, or “partners,” in conjunction with “RH”, “sexual health”, “FP”, “contraceptive use”, “HIV”, as well as “intervention”, and “counseling”. A paper was deemed eligible if it met these criteria: intervened with both members of the couple dyad; described a systematic evaluation design (i.e.; experimental, quasi-experimental, or non-experimental), and; reported at least one effective SRH outcome. Interventions from non-FP sectors were included if they reported one FP-related outcome and/or uptake of couples counseling services. Given study design heterogeneity, we did not calculate pooled effects as typically done in meta-analyses.</p><p>Our search yielded 5,321 articles and reports. A total of 3,738 articles and reports were excluded after pre-screening titles, resulting in the inclusion of 1,583 abstracts for further screening as per the eligibility criteria. Once full-text articles and reports were reviewed and duplicate interventions removed, 85 articles and interventions were deemed relevant according to the inclusion criteria.  Upon closer review, 44 papers were excluded, mostly due to the scope, rigor and quality of their evaluation methods.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 41 papers were included in this review, including 37 peer-reviewed articles, and four project reports. Fifteen of the 41 couples counseling interventions were implemented in Africa (including one in Rwanda); 12 in Asia<em>; </em>11 in North America, and one in Latin America. Of the 41 papers, 23 focused on HIV counseling, 14 on FP, two on MCH, and two on post/abortion care. Evaluation designs varied in rigor. Twenty interventions used randomized experimental study designs, 14 used quasi-experimental designs and seven used non-experimental prospective cohort designs. The majority of couples counseling interventions were implemented in health facilities (27), followed by community spaces (10), participants’ homes (3), and the workplace (1). The described interventions varied from couples-based (couples counseled together) to couples-focused (partners counseled separately).</p><p>The studies reflected improvements in the following FP outcomes:</p>\t<li>Adoption and continuation of contraception, increased birth spacing, reduced pregnancy incidence</li>\t<li>Couple communication and decision marking about FP, partner support for FP,, and positive attitudes toward FP</li>\t<li>Knowledge about fertility, FP, pregnancy, and condom use</li><p>Overall, the reviewed interventions addressed gender power dynamics in the following ways: 1. designing gender sensitive intervention components, and/or; 2. integrating gender relational content into their curricula. The majority of interventions were delivered by either same sex counselors (partners counseled separately) or mixed sex counselor pairs (couples counseled together). A few interventions offered separate partner counseling sessions for the first point of contact, but then allowed participants to choose their mode of counseling thereafter (together or separately).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The literature review findings suggest that couples counseling is a promising practice in improving FP outcomes, despite its nascent evidence-base relative to HIV and other sectors. Several programmatic gaps and areas for further research were identified. First, the diversity of counseling interventions highlights the need to operationalize a generally acceptable definition and associated framework for couples counseling. Such a definition could provide parameters through which to rigorously assess couples counseling efficacy and identify key program elements to increase women’s and/or couples’ empowerment to use FP services. As well, further research should assess whether certain counseling approach methodologies (e.g. counseling partners alone versus together) are more effective than others. As a result of the limited number of identified process evaluations, a clear study of the mechanisms and pathways of change toward improved SRH outcomes should be a priority. Specifically, more evidence is needed to understand the effect of couples counseling on couple dynamics that include communication, reproductive empowerment, FP uptake and continued use, and intimate partner violence (IPV).  In undertaking the literature review, we originally intended to scope existing evidence to inform the development of a potential couples counseling tool. After screening 5,321 papers, and reviewing 41 papers, our conclusion is that there is no one exclusive tool or approach that works best in couples counseling. Taking advantage of the ICFP platform this November, we propose sharing these findings to set forth operational guidelines and principles in defining, conducting and evaluating couples counseling interventions in the FP field.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p><em>Family planning is one of the most effective reproductive health interventions to avert preventable maternal &amp; child deaths.  Fertility and family planning policies and programs in Sub-Saharan Africa have been largely based on findings from studies involving almost exclusively women. Since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), and the 1995 UN World Conference on Women, interest in men's involvement in reproductive health has increased. There has also been a shift in objectives of male participation and concerns, from increasing contraceptive use and achieving demographic goals to achieving gender equality and fulfilling various reproductive responsibilities. Men are also recognized to be responsible for the large proportion of ill reproductive health suffered by their female partners. Male involvement helps not only in accepting a contraceptive but also in its effective use and continuation.</em> <em>Engaging men in family planning has been found also to improve programmatic outcomes and increase gender equality. The role of partner involvement on fertility decisions and contraceptive uptake has not been well studied in Ethiopia</em></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>what is the role of Men in decisions regarding fertility and the utilization of family planning by women.</p><p>what are the characterstics of men that influence the utilization of contraception by women </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A mixed method cross sectional study was carried out among 2891 reproductive age women in four emerging regions of Ethiopia.  Sample sizes were calculated proportional to the estimated number of women in the regions. Multi stage sampling was employed to allocate samples to the different administrative units of the regions. All woredas(clusters) in each region were listed by respective zones. From each region a representative sample of woredas were randomly selected at the first stage using probability proportional to their size.  Then, the register of households in the woredas were retrieved from the woreda’s administration and households were stratified into rural and urban. Considering the strata size, samples were proportionally allocated and selected using systematic random sampling. Structured questionnaire was used to extract data on socio-demographic profile of women/their partners, level of spousal communication on fertility, preference and decision on desired family size, Men’s’ characteristics affecting the utilization of family planning by spouses. Key informant interview, In-depth interview, focus group discussion were done with women, husbands, community leaders and reproductive health workers for qualitative data extraction. Frequency, means, proportions were calculated for quantitative data and results were summarized in tables. The qualitative Data was audio recorded, coded &amp; transcribed verbatim.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><em>About half (47.5%) of the women did not discuss about contraceptive methods with their partners with wide inter-regional differences, the highest being in Afar Region (72%). The desired number of children by the male partners was high and women’s desired average number of children was 6.37, the highest being in Somali region (10.1+4.53) and the lowest in Benshangul-Gumuz region (3+ 2.44). Most women didn’t have the freedom to make independent decision on fertility preference, highest being in afar (58.5%). In all the regions, the male partner was the dominant decision maker on the initiation and continued use of family planning methods.  Better paternal educational status, male attitude towards the use of FP and perceived partners support on the use of family planning and perceived self-efficacy on convincing partner on the use of FP by women were associated with increased uptake of contraceptives.</em></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p><em>Husbands have a predominant role on fertility preferences and decisions on the use of family planning by women. Improving spousal communication, involving male in family planning service provision, improving men education, implementation of interventions to improve husbands’ awareness and attitude on contraceptives are imperative to increase uptake of family planning.</em></p>",

      "title": "Men’s Views of Family Planning and their Access to Services in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uganda’s Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan (FP CIP) 2015-2020 calls for engagement of men as supportive partners and as users of FP, noting the need to reach women, men, youth, and communities with voluntary, high-quality services and information to meet their needs. An objective of the FP CIP is to increase the number of men who support the use of modern contraception for themselves or their partners. The FP CIP noted the importance of mass media and community outreach to dispel myths and misconceptions amongst men to ensure their support of family planning and address unequal gender norms, and to provide services that meet their needs. Scent evidence on the views of men and their engagement in family planning in Uganda was included in the CIP.  Anecdotally, participants in a stakeholder engagement held in preparation of the CIP said that even when men are not opposed to women’s contraceptive use, they often consider family planning a women’s issue. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>To engage men through demand creation and service delivery interventions, it would be helpful to hear from them directly about what they think about FP for themselves and for women. Using data from qualitative research carried out in 2016-2017 in Uganda, this paper focuses on the perspectives of men with and without children regarding: their opinions on family planning, including the bounds of socially acceptable use of family planning; their knowledge and beliefs about and use of contraception; their experience with family planning services; and their opinions on how family planning services and programming could be improved.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data for this paper come from eight focus group discussions (FGD) with men with and without children in communities in Arua District in Northern Uganda and Kapchorwa District in Eastern Uganda to elicit their views on family planning.  Data were collected by Makerere University-based Economic Policy Research Center, with funding under the Evidence Project.  The men in the FGD ranged in age from 18-49 and those with children had between 1-10 children.  The data are analyzed to identify key themes among the groups based on the topics in the FGD guide, with similarities and differences among the groups of men, and among men in the two districts, highlighted.   </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Men’s views on family planning are nuanced and the needs of married and unmarried men differ.  Most men know what family planning is and value it for managing the number of children they have, although they also note prevailing pronatalist norms in their communities.  “You can have a manageable number of children and do planning for new ones” (Man without children, Arua).  Neither group feel they have enough information about contraceptives–for themselves or their partners. “We know FP is to control birth but we have not received much sensitization on family planning as men” (Man with a child, Kapchorwa).  For men with children, most use of contraception is by women, although they wondered why there are not more methods for men.  For young men without children, family planning use is seen as important to protect from unintended pregnancy.  Some men in both groups expressed ambivalence about women’s use of contraception and expressed stereotypical fears of women becoming promiscuous if they used contraception. “For me, I would switch off my network! Immediately. Such a girl is not a serious person and may not want to settle down” (Young man, Arua). This view likely contributed to young men’s use of condoms.  Young men particularly found accessing services difficult – both practically and due to stigma in their communities.  That difficulty sometimes resulted in men engaging in unprotected sex.  “Those people given condoms to distribute are very rare at the time you need them, so you just go live” (Young man, Kapchorwa). </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The findings show that gendered norms about contraceptive use are both reflected and reinforced in services and programs. Men’s views on family planning are a mix of normative beliefs about roles and responsibilities of women and men regarding sex, relationships and contraceptive use; myths and misconceptions about contraceptive methods; and their own experiences with FP services and with their own or their partners’ FP use. Understanding the range of knowledge, beliefs, and experience is critical for reaching men.  The FP CIP notes that men tend to leave family planning to women; yet despite interest, men in this study said they are left out of family planning programming and would like more information and reproductive health and contraception.  They lamented the lack of contraceptive options for men.  Mostly young men made suggestions for improving services – including making condoms available at night when young men need them, dealing with stigmatizing attitudes and lack of confidentiality by providers, and reducing the time it takes to access services.  These findings, which represent the views of men of various ages and those with and without children in two areas of North and East Uganda, provide rich evidence to improve programming to engage men in family planning to meet the goals set in Uganda’s 2015-2020 FP CIP. The findings are useful for demand creation/social behavior change, including addressing gender norms related to family planning use through mass media and community outreach, and for service delivery programming that reaches men as well as women.   </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Very young adolescents (VYAs; ages 10-14) in all contexts undergo rapid physical, emotional, and social changes during puberty. Gender and social norms that shape adolescents’ future sexual and reproductive health (SRH) practices, including sexual debut and contraceptive use, begin to solidify during this period, influenced by peer, family, community, and school. Although early adolescence is a critical window for interventions to influence norms formation, few adolescent-focused programs target VYAs, missing this vital window to address normative barriers to future contraceptive use.</p><p></p><p>Previous interventions tested in rural settings have demonstrated potential to positively influence norms formation among VYAs. To maximize limited resources, programs must adapt and replicate tested approaches. Yet norms transformation requires context-tailored messages and approaches. As more young people grow up in urban environments than ever before and often face worse health and education outcomes than rural counterparts, programs tailored to the context of urban VYAs are needed, but adaptation of messages and approaches developed for rural contexts requires thoughtful, ongoing adjustment.</p><p></p><p>A tested social norms transformation approach was adapted from rural Rwanda and Uganda for use in Kinshasa, DRC, revealing program challenges and considerations for adapting the approach to meet the needs of urban VYAs.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Growing Up GREAT, adapted from the Gender Roles, Equality, and Transformations (GREAT) project in rural Uganda and its GrowUp Smart iteration in Rwanda, uses a socio-ecological approach to engage VYAs and the key actors influencing their attitudes/behaviors. Mixed-sex VYA groups use interactive materials to discuss/reflect on gender norms. Parents participate in facilitated discussion groups using video testimonials (Voices) featuring local parents who have adopted gender-equitable behaviors. Teachers use materials to complement family life education lessons. Health system linkages are fostered through facility exchange visits to facilitate future contraceptive service use. Community members are engaged through an interactive game and through</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Launched in 2015, Growing Up GREAT underwent a year-long adaptation process to revise materials and lay the groundwork for future scale-up by engaging stakeholders’ technical support and building collaborative relationships.  To modify tools and approaches for an urban context, partners conducted community mapping of schools and organizations; a rapid assessment to identify the needs of out-of-school VYAs in particular; and a social norms exploration exercise to identify norms among VYAs, their parents, and the individuals who most influence their behaviors (reference groups). Extensive pre-testing with VYAs and some parents ensured that materials and messages are clearly understood, context-appropriate, and relevant.</p><p>Growing Up GREAT was piloted as a “Learning Lab” with 1,000 VYAs in 40 schools to inform adjustments prior to replication. A qualitative process evaluation provided feedback on the pilot to inform scale-up to an additional 40 schools. Throughout, Growing Up GREAT’s rigorous monitoring system has documented participation by age and sex, and quarterly learning and reflection meetings with implementing partners have provided a platform to discuss challenges and implementation lessons to inform revisions to the approach. A planned participatory youth evaluation will also provide participants’ perspectives on implementation experiences and outcomes.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Adapting an intervention from a rural to an urban setting required a multi-stage process; beyond changes to images and language made during the initial adaptation, more substantive shifts were required to make approaches that were successful in rural settings relevant and appropriate in an urban context. The initial implementation of Growing Up GREAT revealed challenges, cutting across all levels of the socio-ecological model, specific to the urban context, requiring mid-course corrections. Lack of existing community- and school-based platforms for reaching VYAs and parents challenged early assumptions that an urban setting would provide existing capacity and platforms. Parent/caregiver buy-in is essential but participation, particularly of men, is limited by non-nuclear family structures, limited free time due to work schedules and long commutes, and heavy competition for free time. Further, parents, particularly mothers, are heavily influenced by neighbors in a setting with limited privacy and concerned about judgment for adopting new behaviors. Family mobility results in VYAs dropping out of clubs.  In schools, administrative and logistical realities posed other challenges. Overcrowded schools operate multiple sessions each day, limiting time and space for after-school activities; further, school attendance is highly fluid, and older VYAs are often enrolled in younger grades due to short-term absences during previous school years. Implementing activities through the school system requires navigating public and private, parochial and secular institutions with myriad structures and stakeholder perspectives. Health providers in busy urban clinics have limited time to prepare for and facilitate exchange visits.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Implementers have leveraged the project monitoring and learning system to rapidly identify implementation challenges and inform adjustments to the program model. This session will share programmatic lessons from an intervention that engages adolescents in a social norms transformation intervention to increase contraceptive use in underserved communities of Kinshasa, with implications for other vulnerable urban settings worldwide. While programs can and should build from tested approaches, adaptation from rural to urban may require special considerations and flexibility. Messages, materials, and approaches must be carefully tailored to urban contexts, requiring ongoing feedback and program improvement systems in consultation with stakeholders and participants. The experience of adapting, designing and piloting Growing Up GREAT! provides important insight into the challenges of social norm transformation programming with urban VYA and their key influencers. A thoughtful adaptation process with local buy-in and rapid piloting with ongoing monitoring were important to identifying initial challenges and program implications specific to the urban context. Areas for deeper consideration include how to identify and engage different segments of the urban VYA population, including in-and-out-of-school, street-connected, and migrant youth, who have distinct SRH needs and require tailored messages and approaches.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Over the years, national family planning (FP) programs have realized significant impacts in modern contraceptive uptake due to the implementation of time-bound, donor driven programming. A key strategy to implementation of donor led projects has been through intensive technical assistance where the donor provides finances and leads implementation. As a result, sustainability of achievements has been a challenge due to lack of ownership once projects end.</p><p>The Challenge Initiative (TCI) is a five-year project, using a “demand driven” approach to increase the capacity of self-selecting governments to implement effective programs leading to sustained delivery of quality FP services. Technical coaching is a hallmark of TCI, which ensures programs are government-led, owned and sustained.</p><p>In East Africa, TCI is implementing in 17 cities in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to scale-up FP high impact interventions, utilizing lessons learned from the Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (URHI) through a technical coaching model.</p><p>TCI model of coaching adapts a learning approach that supports FP managers to view existing problems and gaps as “solvable” while recognizing that obstacles may be illumined as opportunities.  Mindset shift is fostered through a culture of continuous learning during implementation through TCI University.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Individuals or teams are capable of generating their own solutions, with the coach supplying supportive, discovery-based approaches and frameworks<strong>.</strong></p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Coaching is implemented across the three stages of TCI’s demand-driven model, providing city FP program managers with flexibility to access coaching for learning while continuing to provide the much-needed family planning services in their health facilities.</p><p>FP high impact interventions for urban environments have been codified to enable ease of replication across the different cities. Then, cities self-select to join TCI and commit own resources to access technical coaching and seed funding to help address gaps in FP programming. Concurrently, Local capacity needs based on selected proven FP interventions are determined and a coaching plan jointly developed. TCI then coaches city-identified staff as coaches to assist implementers in implementing the proven intervention; and to date TCI has developed a pool of competent urban FP coaches. TCI acts as a catalyst for change and capacity building through its nine-step coaching framework, connecting city managers and implementers to the critical tools, information, and the expertise needed to design and successful carryout implementation.</p><p>Applying the principles of Knowles Andragogy, coaching is deployed based on planned activities as well as demand from city counterparts, leveraging the use of multiple delivery methods, including technology, and ensuring expert-to-novice and peer-to-peer exchange that reflects collaborative learning environment.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Through the TCI coaching model, 17 cities in East Africa have committed $1.3 million towards conducting FP high impact interventions. To date, 90 city health management team members have graduated as TCI coaches having gone through TCI-U coaching around FP high impact interventions. More than 1,000 people from around the world are accessing and utilizing TCI-U tools and resources. Since April 2017 TCI-U tools and resources have been accessed over 25,000 times with the site attracting about 2500 unique view every month.</p><p>As a result, the 17 cities are implementing high impact interventions per the program design guided by the trained coaches at the city level. About a third of coaching requests are on demand.</p><p>At the preliminary stage, some of the high impact interventions, like FP integrated outreaches, are showing similar outcomes, as those achieved through traditional technical assistance.</p><p>There has been a mindset shift with cities reporting that this TCI coaching model forces them to be in the driver’s seat in implementation as they are the ones not only planning but also implementing actual activities with TCI’s coaching supports on a need basis. Below is a quote from Dr. Betty Langat, The county Director of Health from Kericho County one of the TCI implementing counties, “This is different from the past. What we do will not belong to the donor. We are together creating opportunities for the community to have access, not just now but in the future.”</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Although a significant mindset shift is required moving from traditional technical assistance to coaching support, it is achievable and welcomed in the East African context. There is indication that many more cities are interested in this model. At early stages, we are also witnessing positive results and believe that this will ultimately lead to sustained, scale-up of FP high impact interventions.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning continues to be a significant global health and development challenger that requires well-targeted, all-inclusive strategies, which can be scaled up and sustained. Pilot projects have demonstrated that it’s possible to address challenges affecting FP service delivery and guarantee positive outcomes like increase in contraceptive use. However, gains from these projects are quickly eroded as new projects and governments fail to replicate, own and scale-up high impact interventions from past projects. Some of the challenges facing scale-up include: lack of stakeholder involvement, inadequate resources, weak capacities, lack of systems and poor planning (<em>WHO Nine Step Guide</em>) and the assumption that scale-up will happen on its own.</p><p>The Challenge Initiative (TCI) project is a 5 year project aiming to increase capacities of self-selecting local governments to scale-up proven high-impact FP interventions from the urban reproductive Health Initiative (URHI) leading to increased contraceptive use. This is being implemented in East Africa, Nigeria, India and Francophone West Africa.</p><p>TCI will utilize the systematic approach to scale-up which describes the nine steps to be considered for effective scale-up. This presentation outlines these steps and describes the various stages within TCI that they were implemented in East Africa.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The TCI model uses an innovative, demand driven approach that encourages cities to assume an active role in program design and implementation while local and global partners take facilitative roles in the delivery, scale-up and sustainability of Family Planning (FP). Cities self-select, express interest and commit funds towards FP to participate in the model and implement FP proven high-impact interventions. TCI will incentivize these cities by providing coaching and counterpart funds.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Philippines is rapidly urbanizing. However, experience shows that cities are not prepared to effectively manage pressing health concerns, including the delivery of family planning (FP) services. This challenge is especially acute for the poor, who have high unmet need for FP. Population growth in barangays with large poor communities is significantly higher than growth in the cities in which the barangays are situated. This high rate is primarily due to net natural increase rather than net migration into slum communities.</p><p>Being at the early stage of urban growth, secondary cities like Bacolod have better chances of addressing urban management issues than do the urban sprawls of Manila, Cebu, and Davao. They can benefit from evidence-based strategies for reaching their rapidly growing poor populations and addressing their FP needs, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Its use has been proven effective in planning and programming efforts related to health and development at the global level. VisayasHealth’s Unmet Need Reduction Strategy (UNRS) for FP uses GIS in addressing the unmet need for FP wherein satisfied users of FP are mobilized to motivate clients to seek services during special FP days.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Bacolod’s poor families were identified using the University of the Philippines in the Visayas survey and the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD’s) National Housing Targeting System (NHTS) list. Using GIS, maps of the poor barangays in Bacolod City from both sources were generated. Additionally, the proportion of poor households per barangay based on the NHTS list was also determined and converted into maps. Lastly, the maps of barangays with more than 1,500 households were generated. These maps were overlaid, and barangays with the highest density of urban poor were prioritized for the provision of FP services.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Guided with the spatial information obtained from the various GIS maps, the Bacolod City Health Office (CHO) chose to implement the VisayasHealth project’s UNRS in two clustered priority barangays. Each cluster comprises three neighboring and adjacent barangays with more than 1,500 households. Cluster 1 is composed of Banago, Mandalagan, and Barangay 1; Cluster 2 consists of Handumanan, Cabug, and Felisa.</p><p>FP Days were then organized in the two clustered barangays. In addition to the mobilization of satisfied FP users, the CHO also worked with groups such as International Care Ministries (ICM) to help reach out to those who expressed a need for FP. The use of maps, planning, and decision making in the prioritization of communities, as well as follow-up and scale-up, greatly facilitated the implementation of UNRS in the poor barangays. A pre- and post- intervention comparison of the number of FP users in the priority barangays was used as the measure of the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Between November 2016 and August 2018, the Bacolod CHO implemented the UNRS, guided by the GIS mapping technology, in two prioritized clustered barangays. In Cluster 1, a total of 171 clients opted to use the long acting and reversible contraception (LARC) within the seven rounds of FP days conducted, In Cluster 2, 174 clients chose to use LARC during the seven rounds of FP days conducted. With the use of UNRS approach, the local government unit was able to mobilize a total of 82 IUD satisfied users and ICM volunteers, who then referred 384 clients for FP (including other FP methods) who all received the FP method of their choice over the course of 14 FP days in the two clusters. Further, two previously trained nonperforming providers were coached to regain their confidence in IUD insertion during the conduct of FP days, and these two providers were then recommended for certification of proficiency in IUD insertion. After the completion of seven FP days per cluster, clients were observed to be coming to the facility during regular clinic days for FP counseling and services. These figures favorably compare to the 12 and 15 FP clients reported in the preceding year in the two clusters, respectively.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>With the experience of the local government of Bacolod, the GIS mapping technology proved to be a useful tool for the cities in the beginning phases of growth, specifically in the identification of areas with high unmet need for FP, as well as the identification of high densities of poor households. As such, the GIS maps also supported the identification of priority of areas for UNRS implementation. Further, GIS mapping proved to be useful in identifying areas for the capacity building and deployment of trained FP providers. Lastly, the maps helped determine the timing of the transition from active client recruitment for the conduct of special FP days into a routine mode of service provision.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The antenatal and postpartum periods are critical to providing postpartum family planning (PPFP) counselling and services to prevent unintended pregnancies. The World Health Organization’s Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (2015) expands contraceptive options appropriate for the immediate postpartum period, allowing women delivering in facilities to choose from a wider range of contraceptives before discharge. The 2014-2015 DHS shows that 99% of pregnant women receive at least one antenatal care (ANC) visit from skilled personnel and 91% deliver in a health facility assisted by a skilled provider. Postpartum unmet need is high; secondary analysis of the 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) showed that 51% of women less than two years postpartum were not using an FP method even though they did not want another pregnancy soon. The time from delivery at a facility to discharge is a golden opportunity to provide PPFP services. Counselling during the antenatal period is critical to inform women about the expanded contraceptive options available in the immediate postpartum period and prepare them for immediate PPFP. The aim of this assessment is to demonstrate that building capacity of providers to conduct PPFP counselling in ANC and to provide immediate PPFP services increases PPFP uptake.  </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The Government of Rwanda is committed to scaling up PPFP, especially in the immediate postpartum period, including provision of postpartum long‑acting and reversible contraceptives (PPLARCs) such as implants and postpartum intrauterine devices (PPIUDs). The U.S. Agency for International Development’s Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP), in consultation with the Ministry of Health, aimed to strengthen the capacity of health workers in PPFP counselling and services, including PPLARCs. This was achieved through competency‑based trainings, supportive supervision and mentorship. To ensure continuum of services, PPFP messages and services were integrated into other services such as ANC, maternity, postnatal care, and immunization.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To meet the Government of Rwanda’s commitment, MCSP provided support to implement   immediate PPFP/PPLARC in 12 hospitals and 145 health centres of 10 MCSP focus districts (Rwamgana, Ngoma, Kamonyi, Musanze, Nyamagabe, Nyaruguru, Gatsibo, Nyagatare, Huye, Nyabihu). From July 2016 to December 2017, MCSP supported capacity building through competency-based trainings; post-training on-site mentorship; supportive supervision; and provision of 3 PPIUD kits per health facility. The program resulted in strengthening counselling skills of 308 providers and clinical skills of 320 providers on PPFP/PPLARC.(total-628 providers). The intervention was integrated with ANC, day of birth, and immediate postpartum care, and linked to postnatal care and immunization services. Providers trained included medical doctors, nurses and midwives from the maternity, ANC and FP clinics. MCSP conducted coaching and mentorship, applying corrective actions where gaps were identified<em>.</em> Meetings with local authorities and mobilization sessions on PPFP services were held to raise awareness, inform them about this new intervention, and enable them to give information to the people in their communities. Data on FP/PPFP uptake from July 2016 to December 2017 was collected from program reports and the health management information system (HMIS<em>). </em>Intended beneficiaries are women in need of immediate PPFP services, health providers and health systems.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Program reports show that over 18 months of implementation from July 2016 to December 2017, 164,915 women at the intervention facilities were counselled on PPFP during ANC and 33,537 accepted an FP method before discharge. Of the women accepting immediate PPFP, 56.6% used an implant, 30.2% used progesterone only pills, 5.1% used the Lactational Amenorrhea Method, 3.7% used condoms, 2.1% used PPIUD and 2.1% used tubal ligation. The proportion of women accepting an immediate postpartum method rose from 17% during the July-September 2016 quarter to 45% October-December 2017. Prior to the intervention, PPFP uptake was not routinely measured or captured in the HMIS. According to HMIS reports, which capture data on all FP users, during the same 18-month period, 157,238 women adopted an FP method. This represents an increase compared to the 18 months before implementation of the intervention (January 2015 to June 2016), during which 137,267 women adopted FP methods. HMIS data also shows shifts in method mix between those periods towards greater use of long-acting methods; use of implants rose from 16.1% to 35% and use of IUD rose from 0.8% to 5.2% of FP acceptors. Program data shows a similar trend in rise of long-acting method use among women delivering in supported facilities, with 30% of women delivering accepting PPLARCs by October-December 2017.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Interventions focused on immediate PPFP help address the contraceptive needs of women in this critical period. Counselling during ANC helps prepare the woman and family for taking up an immediate PPFP method. Reinforcing counselling messages during ANC and in the immediate postpartum period along with strengthening PPFP method provision contributes to increasing trends of PPFP uptake prior to discharge from the health facility after delivery. Capacity building for immediate PPFP, including appropriate counselling as well the provision of services, is promising as a means to reduce unmet need and strengthen uptake of FP methods in general, including long‑acting reversible contraceptives. System strengthening to ensure a continuous supply of commodities and equipment, an enabling environment and monitoring is essential for continuous and sustainable quality service provision.</p>",

It can be used during post-partum periods irrespective of breastfeeding to improve birth spacing and reduce maternal-child mortality. However, this method remains highly underutilized.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>We developed a multi-level intervention targeting both supply, demand, and sustainability to increase uptake of the post-partum IUD (PPIUD) including post-placental, within 48 hours, or within 6 weeks after delivery in Kigali, Rwanda.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Formative work beginning in June 2017 informed development of a PPIUD promotional flipchart to be delivered in clinic during antenatal care (ANC), labor and delivery, infant vaccination visits or in the community by community health workers in Kigali, Rwanda. The flipchart focused on the PPIUD but also addressed hormonal implants: both of these long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) can also be inserted any time after delivery. Prior knowledge surveys confirmed a high level of knowledge and easy access to injectable and oral hormonal contraception but low levels of LARC knowledge. Two-day PPIUD didactic counseling, insertion, and follow-up trainings were provided to labor and delivery and family planning nurses, followed by a mentored certification process (five PPIUD insertions including post-placental, before 48 hours and up to 6 weeks after delivery had to be performed correctly for the trainee to be certified). Facility needs assessments allowed us to select high-volume hospitals and health centers in Kigali for implementation of promotions and service delivery beginning in August 2017. Stakeholders were involved from intervention development through finding dissemination.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Two hospitals and three health centers were selected.  Promotions and service delivery began in Aug 2017. By March 2018, 35 staff received training to deliver the PPIUD and implant flipchart, and 47 providers received PPIUD provision training (and 30 were certified). Between August 2017-Mar 2018, 4,774 women had received promotions who later delivered, and of those 1,496 PPIUDs had been inserted (31% uptake). Before these training activities, only one nurse and one midwife from each hospital were providing PPIUD services and no PPIUD services were being offered at the health facilities. In the 6-months prior to our intervention, just 48 PPIUDs had been placed at the selected health facilities (a &gt;3000% increase in uptake comparing the 6 months prior to the intervention to the seven months afterward, p</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This successful, comprehensive intervention combining demand creation and skilled supply has the potential to make a significant impact on PPIUD uptake in Rwanda. Women are interested in the service if well counseled and offered PPIUD services, and users were satisfied with the services. The intervention is also scalable and adaptable to other sub-Saharan African countries if PPIUD providers and promoters are adequately trained and supported to provide and promote the service. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Over the past decade, Rwanda’s Family Planning program has achieved tremendous results, spearheaded by the government’s commitment to addressing the country’s very high population density, which is seen as one of its biggest challenges to sustainable development.  </p><p>To overcome this challenge, since 2010, the Rwandan Ministry of Health initiated Community-Based Provision of Family Planning (CBP-FP) by using existing networks of Community Health Workers (CHWs) to provide services at the community level, which reflects a fundamental shift in the philosophy of Rwanda’s family planning (FP) programs.</p><p>In Rwanda, each village has 3 community health workers and in 2015, 791 CHWs (one per village) were trained on providing CBP-FP methods in Kamonyi and Rwamagana districts. To further increase the number of FP users, MCSP in collaboration with the Rwanda Biomedical Center, trained the 2 remaining CHWs per village in CBP-FP.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Community-based provision of family planning services is a strategy for increasing access to family planning, where CHWs sensitize their communities about the impact of population growth and provide: condoms, oral contraceptive pills, injectable, and the Standard Days Method. CHWs are only allowed to give resupplies to FP clients who have already been initiated on the method by a health provider. CHWs are also trained to refer clients to the health center in the case of any suspected side effects. We evaluated the contribution of CHWs in delivering FP methods in two districts of Rwanda.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The evaluation focused on the 2016–2017 period, during which CHWs were providing FP methods in Kamonyi and Rwamagana districts. Rwanda’s Health Management Information System (HMIS), Community Information System (SIS-com) were used as data sources.</p><p>In Rwamagana and Kamonyi districts, from March 2016 to August 2016, MCSP trained two additional CHWs in the 791villages of Kamonyi and Rwamgana districts The theoretical sessions of the training were given during a period of one week, followed by one week of the practical sessions on anatomic model and six weeks of practice on human beings including injectable methods under supervision of site’s trainers.  After the training period, validation sessions were organized where CHWs who had a performance of at least 75%, as rated by the FP mentors at the local health center, were allowed to provide CBP-FP methods. Quarterly meetings with CHWs and regular supervision and mentorship activities were conducted with the purpose of maintaining and improving CHWs skills and competencies in CBP/FP provision after the training</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>From March to August 2016, 672 and 782 CHWs were successfully trained and validated on CBP-FP in Kamonyi and Rwamagana districts, respectively. In 2016, when only one CHW was providing CBP-FP services, Kamonyi district enrolled 12,368 new users of FP methods, 4,594 (37.1%) were followed by CHWs and 7,774 (62.8%) were followed at health facilities while Rwamagana district enrolled 13,742 new users of FP methods, 4,148 (30%) by CHWs and 9,594 (70%) at health facility level.</p><p>In 2017, after the training and validation of the 2 additional CHWs, Kamonyi district enrolled 14,969 new users of FP methods, 3,984 (26.6%) were resupplied in FP methods by CHWs while Rwamagana district enrolled 15,159 new users of FP methods, 4,372(29%) were resupplied in FP methods by CHWs</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Building capacity of Community health workers in CBP-FP played a key role in increasing the number of FP users at both facility level and community level</p><p>Community health workers play a significant role in resupplying family planning methods at community level, therefore in reducing the workload of health care providers.</p><p>Regular supervisions, meetings and mentorship with CHWs are important in order to maintain and improve CHWs skills and competencies in providing CBP-FP services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The government of Rwanda has embraced family planning as a central component of development. Beyond the timing and limiting of children, the government views family planning as a vehicle to better health through decreased maternal, infant, and child mortality. Rwanda has made measurable success in bringing family planning information and accessibility to its citizens. Targeted governmental policy implementation has thus far yielded impressive gains over the last 10 years in contraceptive use. Following a set of top-down policy mandates from the federal government, contraceptive use in Rwanda has increased from 17% to 53% over a 10-year period. This growth is remarkable and an obvious outlier in family planning programs globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which has typically lagged behind more general global increases in family planning accessibility. The Rwandan Government maintains an aggressive approach to the stated goal of reaching middle-income country status, and views family planning as an integral part of the strategy to grow the nation’s economy. Understanding potential barriers and limitations that remain in this family planning program has obvious benefit to individual women, families, communities, the nation, and beyond. Externally, Rwanda’s increased family planning capacity trends may provide potential models for other countries.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The research goal is to use qualitative interviews to learn from the current generation of high-level government and private sector family planning experts in Rwanda working to implement and assess the nation’s family planning program to shed light on the following: key factors promoting this measured progress, potential determinants that are limiting the continued success of Rwanda’s family planning program, the future outlook for the program, as well as the possibility of translating some of the success in other national contexts.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This qualitative study was conducted in, Kigali, Rwanda, in July of 2017. The data for the study consist of 13 in-depth interviews conducted with family planning program experts in Rwanda to better understand the mechanisms for success, elucidate remaining challenges, speculate on the future of the program, and discuss potential applicability for translating aspects of the program in other settings. The topic guide included questions about the study participant’s background, family planning program strengths and weaknesses, anticipated future directions, as well as the possibility of translating aspects of the family planning program in different contexts. Two of the authors (including one native Kinyarwanda speaker) conducted each interview in English at the offices of the key informants or other locations identified as conducive by the interviewees. The interviews averaged 45 minutes in duration and  were audio recorded when permission was received from participants. This was the case for twelve of the interviews. The recordings were then transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was guided by the thematic content analysis approach and executed using Atlas.ti 8 software and group level matrices. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington and with the Rwandan Ministry of Education prior to collection.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>When asked to describe the motivating factor behind Rwanda’s successful family planning program, all study participants first mentioned the strong impact of the government. In fact, all positive aspects mentioned as contributing to the success of the program could be traced back to the government’s political will, strong leadership, innovation, funding, and evaluation. Importantly, respondents described collaboration across sectors driven with clear intent from the highest levels of government.</p><p>Study participants openly acknowledged challenges faced by Rwanda’s family planning program, including the following issues: reaching rural Rwandans with services, adolescent access to and use of services, funding, human resources, and opposition from religious institutions. Each challenge identified has been addressed, at least partially, with innovative solutions.</p><p>Participants in the study agreed that aspects of Rwanda’s successful family planning program can be translated to other countries and that “there is no magic”:  “Well, I think it is tricky to copy and paste programs into other countries with different contexts. But there are specific innovations made in Rwanda that could be tailored to other countries’ contexts.” When participants were asked if the family planning program in Rwanda could be translated to other places, they were eager to explain the parts of the program that could help other countries succeed as well. As one participant explained: “we were not written the same way.” Thus, it is difficult to implement all parts of the Rwandan family planning program in other countries, but other countries can learn from specific parts of the program. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Family planning is instrumental in development, as has been the case for Rwanda. Key informants at the central level shed light on the importance of government leadership and political will in being the main contribution to success for the family planning program in Rwanda. Coordination and integration between family planning stakeholders, which has been facilitated by political will, has greatly contributed to the success as well. Participants also openly discussed the challenges of sustainability and long-term funding, continued efforts to increase accessibility in rural areas, addressing the adolescent access gap, and barriers from Catholic Church providers as current foci of the program. The key informants were very open to discussing the program challenges and were hopeful about the ongoing proactive efforts to address each of the identified challenges.            </p><p>Rwanda has made impressive gains in contraceptive use; however, contraceptive use is not the goal in Rwanda, but rather a means to “empower the people.” By acknowledging ongoing challenges, interviewees hoped to bring their nation closer to this goal. By sharing Rwanda’s successes, respondents hoped Rwanda’s innovations could be translated to other countries. Add strong political will and understanding a country’s context, and respondents were confident success would follow. Family planning is intertwined with other areas of health, development, poverty reduction, and empowerment in Rwanda. Thus, sharing Rwanda’s innovations, knowledge, and experiences with family planning, the country with the highest family planning program effort score, has the potential to create change beyond the nation’s borders. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Kenya’s largest population proportion is youthful, with over half (61.5%) ranging 0-24 years. Despite the gradual increase in population size, the country’s Total Fertility Rates (TFR) has been improving since year 2003. This reveals that Kenya has made credible progress in improving its contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) and reduction of unmet need for FP. These two factors have led to the reduction in the TFR. There has also been an increase in uptake of long acting methods from 9% in 2008/9 to 25% in 2014. Despite the overall progress in TFR and CPR, there are disparities among different counties, and specific population groups such as adolescents, and among women in poor backgrounds and hard to reach areas. For instance, the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) in central Kenya is 73% while North Eastern is at 3.4%. In addition, disparities in FP utilization rates are still visible among different regions, and specific population groups such as adolescents, the poor and marginalized women</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>FP financing is projected to remain heavily dependent on development partners, a situation that puts FP services at risk since Kenya graduated to a middle income country status in 2014. The risk is attributed to the fact that development partners may re-orient their programmes away from their current focus hence the need to explore other ways of financing FP provision in Kenya. Health insurance coverage in Kenya is still below optimal levels since only 17 percent of individuals are covered by some form of health insurance with the poor bearing the highest burden of non-coverage</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The assessment adopted a participatory and appreciative evaluation approach that involved and engage all the key stakeholders; encourage listening and empower individuals and demonstrated respect for their views. The approach essentially involved consultation with relevant people from NCPD, MoH and UNFPA, participation of target groups and learning from their experiences. The methodology involved collection of both primary and secondary data. The analysis of the FP situation and emerging evidence involved a thorough review of documents that encompassed the following: audit of other assessments, evaluations, research reports, and other documents that presented gap analysis in FP programme; review of KDHS reports, key studies on FP and Reproductive Health at NCPD and MoH; review of relevant findings from national symposiums as they relate to FP coverage and financing. From literature review, the assessment utilized data for year 2015 and 2016 (whether calendar or fiscal year) to understand the following: on aggregate, how much was mobilized for FP in 2015 and 2016? ; total resources mobilized for health services by NHIF and private health/ medical health insurance providers; how much NHIF and private health/ medical health insurance  providers reimbursed the health services providers for general services and for FP? Primary data collection involved.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The study establishes that health insurance coverage in Kenya is still below optimal levels since only 17 percent of individuals are covered by some form of health insurance with the poor bearing the highest burden of non-coverage. It further establishes that only 2.9 of the poorest 20 percent Kenyans have any form of health insurance coverage; although, the nationwide survey found that a majority of Kenyans, regardless of their household wealth were covered by the NHIF. Health/ medical insurance by NHIF include FP explicitly in publicity materials, while private sector providers include only aspects of FP in the maternity package. The study also reveals that there has been a decline in the amount of funds invested by the National Government and County governments in FP attributed to lack of a smooth transition from centralized to decentralized health service delivery with the devolution dispensation and increased donor funding for FP commodities and services. Service providers cited challenges such as delays with reimbursement and inadequacy of the capitation for family planning.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Health/ medical insurance by NHIF include FP explicitly in the publicity materials, while private sector providers include only aspects of FP in the maternity package. The NHIF benefits scheme currently pays for all FP commodities and services including sterilization, with the challenge on the FP service provider’s side being lack of scheme specificity. This means that there is a lack of understanding (and documentation) on the NHIF schemes; adding to the complexity of their management as many providers have several scheme contracts (including in-patient). Most of the providers consulted do not provide any family planning under capitation from NHIF. These remain fee paying services, even for women enrolled in the NHIF or ‘Linda Mama’ (free maternity services). This being the case, majority of FP clients would conclude that NHIF does not cover for FP, and since the position is that FP is covered there is need for robust demand creation for FP services under the NHIF scheme. On the other hand, private health/ medical insurance companies offer maternity packages, which provide for pre-natal, maternity and complications. However, they do not have an exclusive FP cover unless it is a managed liability fund provided for by the corporate client. The managed fund is not premium based but rather a corporate organization provides the funds and stipulates the benefits &amp; exclusions. The main reason behind this is that FP can be planned for and does not have the uncertainty and risk associated with other illnesses and complications. Some also view it as</p>",

      "title": "Financing for equity and choice: finessing family planning inclusion in Ghana’s National Health Insurance",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The post-2015 focus on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the growing evidence that health insurance programs can enhance access for all to health services, offer an opportunity to help fill the gap in unmet need by including family planning (FP) in health insurance benefit packages. However, family planning is often overlooked when countries are developing their national health insurance service packages.</p><p>In Ghana, the 2012 revised National Health Insurance Agency (NHIA) Act 852 specified the inclusion of 'any relevant FP package' in the NHIS benefit package. However, this has never been implemented.</p><p>This abstract presents key process learning and initial results from work to operationalize the integration of Family Planning into the National Health Insurance in Ghana. This learning is applicable to programmers and policy makers looking to ensure the inclusion of FP in Primary Health Care packages in other countries.</p><p></p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Marie Stopes International Ghana (MSIG) is running a pilot with the NHIA in 6 districts to operationalize the effective integration of payment for FP services into the primary health care package. The pilot will demonstrate how to integrate case based payments for FP into existing systems, with a particular emphasis on long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) services. It provides valuable data on service utilisation and claims to inform budgeting for FP.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The pilot has been rolled out in 6 pilot districts in the north, centre and south of the country and in 2 control districts in March and service delivery will start on the 15th of April. It is designed to run for up to 2 years to allow time for providers and clients to adapt to the inclusion of FP in the NHIS benefit package. Participating public and private providers are reimbursed through the NHIA payment systems for each implant, IUD or injectable service provided. A ‘service’ includes both comprehensive FP counselling and the provision of the method chosen by the client. We will be presenting process findings  and recommendations from key stakeholder interactions during our development phase, and initial service provision results coming from the districts. This will include baseline data (to be carried out in May 2018) and initial results on costs of FP Services and claims processed, FP service uptake, and quality of FP services. The information will come from the NHIS claims data base, GHS DHIMS 2 database and Ghana Health Service Reproductive Services LOG. Key questions on the design of integrated Family Planning into the National Health Insurance package were addressed during the development phase.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Providers will be paid through case-based reimbursements to align incentives with promoted clinical methods; providers will be encouraged to offer the full range of methods and refer as needed. Based on the discussions held and an analysis of potential perverse effects and fraud reduction, it was decided that payments under the pilot will cover three methods of FP requiring <strong>clinical </strong>delivery; Implant, IUDs and injectables. This will include counselling, insertions and removals, surgical procedures, medical supplies and consumables.</p><p>As FP commodities are currently subsidized by donors and government has engaged itself in the FP2020 engagements to increasingly contribute towards these commodities, FP commodities and drugs will continue to be procured and supplied directly by Government and donors and will not be part of the reimbursement fee.</p><p>All NHIA registered service providers (public, faith-based and private providers) in the selected districts  - will be covered. However, tariffs have been adjusted to take account of additional costs incurred by the private sector.</p><p>A positive spin-off from the process is that, because of the intensity of the technical discussions, NHIA has derived clear understanding of key potential issues during the development phase of the approach. While the ideas and assumptions are yet to be tested on the ground, there is already supporting theoretical evidence to justify the direction being taken that can guide national roll-out.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>To reach the poor there is a need to have innovative approaches to promote access to FP services, this pilot will be able to demonstrate the role that health financing and in particular national health insurance can play in this. While further program considerations will be drawn when initial results are analysed, we identified a number of important lessons.  </p><p><strong>Include FP from the design stage</strong> - for stakeholders to successfully integrate FP into a package, the ‘how’ of FP inclusion should be really thought through from the very beginning and not added at a later date.</p><p><strong>Remember stakeholders’ varying perspectives </strong>- prior to engaging with stakeholders take time to understand their respective contexts, to anticipate their potential responses and to strategize on whether and how to address them.</p><p><strong>Be patient</strong> - Family Planning is not straight forward as most primary health care services. The complexities of family planning particularly with regards to the cultural barriers are not always understood by all and therefore a level of learning should be integrated as part of the pilot.</p><p><strong>Be flexible</strong> - It is important to recognise that the key elements of such a project may not be fully defined upfront; changes will continue to be made as there is new information and clarity on existing information.</p>",

      "title": "The effect of community based health insurance on modern family planning utilization in Ethiopia ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) schemes typically cater to the informal sector and have been established in a number of developing countries to expand access to modern health care service. Having this experience, Ethiopia started CBHI implementation to improve access to health services. The Government of Ethiopia introduced CBHI in 2011 in 13 woredas (districts), and expanded to 228 woredas in Tigray, Amhara, Oromiya and SNNPR regions since then.  </p><p>Available evidence suggests that CBHI membership has positive effects on health care utilization. Despite this, the overall health risk profile of those enrolled in the scheme is not very different from those not enrolled. There is no specific evidence that indicates the role of CBHI in improving modern family planning (FP) utilization in Ethiopia. In 2017 Pathfinder International conducted an assessment with the aim to evaluate the effect of CBHI on modern FP utilization as part of its routine outcome monitoring activities.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Pathfinder International is implementing the USAID Transform: Primary Health Care project (TRANSFORM). TRANSFORM will contribute to preventable maternal and child deaths (PMCD) by supporting the implementation of the Ethiopian Government’s Health Sector Transformation Plan (HSTP). The project will support attainment of the four HSTP transformational agendas: (1) Woreda Transformation; (2) Caring, Respectful, and Compassionate providers; (3) Quality and Equity in Health Care; and (4) Information Revolution. Overall success will result from achievement of four high-level results: improved health systems management and performance; improved service quality. CBHI and FP are the two key interventions of the project to meet its objective.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>TRANSFORM implements an annual multistage cross-sectional survey. The project supports 300 woredas in its four major target regions and established 29 clusters-level offices (CLOs).  </p><p>A sampling frame was prepared by listing Woreda Health Offices (WorHOs) under each CLO, health centres (HCs) under each WorHOs, and Health Posts (HPs) under each HC. 164 WorHOs, 328 HCs and 694 HPs were selected randomly using proportion to the size of the region. If a HP was randomly selected for the continuous household survey, then selected HP associated village was chosen for the next stage of sampling. From each selected village, five households were selected using a random-walk technique. 3,433 households were selected for the first round of the survey.  </p><p>The household questionnaire captured CBHI status of the household and FP use data from randomly selected women in the 15-49 years’ age group. Regional and CLO staff were trained on the questionnaire and were responsible for data collection in their catchment areas as part of follow up visits. The data management process was managed at the project regional and country office levels. Data collection for the first annual survey was conducted from October 1 - December 31, 2017 and 3,313 women of reproductive age were interviewed.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The result indicated that 50.8% of married women in the 15 – 49 years’ age group were exposed to CBHI as their households were already enrolled in CBHI schemes. Current modern FP use is 47.5% among all married women in the 15-49 age group in project supported areas. Modern FP use is 50.9% among married women who are exposed to CBHI schemes, while it was 44.1% among women who are not exposed to CBHI. Results from the logistics regression showed that women who were exposed to CBHI are 1.3 times more likely to practice modern FP (OR=1.3, 1.1 – 1.6) compared to women who are not exposed to CBHI, which is statistically significant.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>CBHI enrolment improves FP use among women of child bearing age even though FP is provided for free. Women who have access to CBHI schemes may frequently visit health facilities seeking services for themselves and their families during which they may be introduced to FP services. This in turn may improve their awareness and attitude towards FP. As a result, women who are part of CBHI schemes may have better utilization rate compared to women who are not. The result of this study will help program implementers see the benefit of CBHI schemes in FP programming particularly in rural settings, and the opportunity to increase lifelong returns in Ethiopia.</p>",

      "title": "The effect of Indonesia’s national insurance scheme on contraceptive use, method, and provider.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Indonesia’s modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) grew substantially in the 1980s, in part, through the development of an extensive community-based distribution network of family planning fieldworkers and volunteers that overcame supply-side constraints. In the 1990s, the Village Midwife Program positioned more than 50,000 midwives in communities. Injectables became the predominant method (53% in 2015) and a stable source of additional income for midwives, many of whom combined their public duties with private practice. Despite the widespread reach of this program, disparities in access to services favored Java-Bali islands and, between 2000 and 2012, the mCPR stalled at 61.1%. While the latest Demographic and Health Survey (2017) shows unmet need has declined from 14.4% to 10.6%, so has mCPR from 61.1% to 57.2%. In 2014, a national health insurance scheme, Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional(JKN) administered by Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial Kesehatan (BPJS-Kesehatan), was established and scheduled to cover all populations by 2019. The national family planning agency (BKKBN) is mandated to continue to procure contraceptive commodities free-of-charge while BPJS-Kesehatan reimburses service fees charged by public and qualified private providers. JKN has expanded insurance access; however, the non-reimbursement of private midwives’ fees leaves a gap in contraceptive insurance coverage.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We aim to answer three questions: (1) Is insurance coverage presently associated with contraceptive use among married women in Indonesia? (2) Is insurance coverage associated with the choice of a contraceptive provider or method used among married contraceptive users? (3) Do these associations differ in rural and urban settings? We hypothesize that insured women are more likely to use contraception, but less likely to use midwife-provided injectables because these latter’s fees are not reimbursed by the new schemes. Furthermore, we expect weaker associations in rural areas as a result of inequity in access to insurance, contraceptive methods, and providers.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We pool two rounds of nationally representative, cross sectional data collected by Performance, Monitoring and Accountability (PMA2020) in June-August 2015 and October 2016-January 2017. PMA2020 surveys women of reproductive age on their reproductive preferences, birth history, and past, current and future contraceptive use and provider preferences. We analyze three outcomes of interest: (1) current modern contraceptive use, (2) contraceptive method categorized as injectable user, other short-term method user, and long-term method user, and (3) provider type categorized as public/private midwife, other public provider, other private provider. The main predictor of interest is insurance coverage categorized as no insurance, BPJS (the national health insurance scheme), Jamkesda (the local insurance scheme), and other insurance which includes private insurance, the health card, or a combination of schemes. Using logistic regression models, we estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for contraceptive use and adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRRs) for contraceptive method and provider type, as well as 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The models are adjusted for woman’s age, parity, education, and province and repeated with urban/rural stratification. All analyses are weighted to account for the two-stage cluster sampling design.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Of the 15,778 married women in the sample, 55.4% had insurance (27.1% BPJS, 16.2% Jamkesda, 12.1% Other insurance) and 58.8% used modern contraception. Only 55.7% of contraceptive users were insured, and more than a majority used injectables (53.5%) and obtained their method from a public or private midwife (54.3%). However, 47.3% of injectable users and 49.6% of women who obtained their method from a midwife were not insured. Women insured through Jamkesda were significantly more likely to use modern contraception than uninsured women (aOR [95%CI]:1.33[1.15-1.53], p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The introduction of a national health insurance scheme in Indonesia has expanded insurance coverage, but its translation into direct benefits for women and their spouses and promotion through the country’s family planning program is incomplete based on this study’s findings. We found no association between insurance status and injectable use but a significant one with provider type. Insured women were less likely to obtain contraceptives from midwives, particularly in urban areas. Increased access to insurance appears not to directly influence the level of contraceptive use given the entrenched preference for injectables and midwife providers. However, the national insurance scheme should consider diversifying the provider coverage to include private midwives and respond to the strong method mix and contraceptive provider preferences. Even though the legislation enacting JKN does not preclude midwives from participating in the insurance scheme and being eligible for the non-capitated fee reimbursement, they need to be clinically networked, and thus supervised by obstetricians and gynecologists. This complicates the direct reimbursement process to midwives. Despite increased insurance coverage through JKN, midwives’ de facto exclusion from insurance financing has been to the detriment of users who continue to bear out-of-pocket costs for injectable service fees. While the full effect of JKN will not be realized until 2019, to ensure full access and full choice, coverage of midwives’ contraceptive service seems implicit and important to future health financing mechanisms.</p>",

      "title": "Another tool in the toolbox: digital health as a high-impact practice for social and behavior change and health systems strengthening to improve family planning outcomes",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>As the penetration of digital technologies (e.g., mobile phones, computers, tablets) rapidly increases in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), experts believe that utilizing digital applications to optimize health outcomes has the potential to expand exponentially, increasing reach and improving access to information and services. In 2013, USAID summarized the current state of the evidence on digital health (previously termed “mHealth”) and family planning and categorized the use of mHealth as “emerging” as part of the High Impact Practices for Family Planning (HIP) initiative, noting its strong potential—including a few promising case studies—to improve family planning programs as well as the need for more experiences and research. Four years later, with funding through the USAID-funded K4Health Project, FHI 360—the original authors of the HIP brief—updated it, broadening the scope to “digital health” and dividing it into two briefs.  One brief focuses on using digital technology to strengthen health systems and family planning service delivery, while the other focuses on using digital technology for social and behavior change (SBC) to support end-users in adopting healthy sexual and reproductive behaviors. These most recent evidence reviews have demonstrated digital health as an enhancement (health systems) and a promising high-impact practice for family planning. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Interventions using digital technology for family planning and sexual and reproductive health in LMICs were assessed for their ability to strengthen health systems and family planning service delivery and to enhance SBC methods, ultimately resulting in increased contraceptive uptake.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We used the inclusion criterion: “peer-reviewed articles and grey literature highlighting the use of digital health technology to advance family planning in LMICs” and searched PubMed and mHealth Evidence; we also searched for grey literature in the USAID/African Strategies for Health mHealth compendiums. Our search was restricted to the years 2013-2016 for health systems strengthening, and 2013-2017 for SBC. Search terms included: (“contracept*” or (“family planning”)) and mHealth; (“contracept*” or (“family planning”)) and “digital health”); ((“family planning” OR contracept*) AND Facebook); ((“family planning” OR contracept*) AND Twitter); ((“family planning” OR contracept*) AND “social media”); ((“family planning” OR contracept*) AND \"text message\"); (digital health” AND (“family planning” OR contraception) AND “cost” AND “scale”).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Evidence from three interventions showed digital applications can improve the quality and availability of data for decision-making within health systems through national health management information systems and logistics management information systems; in the case of the latter, evidence shows reductions in stock-outs as a result of digital applications. Further, interventions implemented in seven different countries suggested digital technology can improve provider capacity by complementing in-person trainings, improving client-provider interactions through mobile job aids, and providing a cost-effective option for remote supportive supervision to community health workers. Finally, two different interventions implemented in Bangladesh and Madagascar found digital technologies can improve efficiency, accountability, and transparency of financial transactions, such as using mobile money to reimburse family planning service providers for services rendered. The results led to this brief being classed as a HIP enhancement.</p><p>The evidence also suggested that using digital technologies as part of an evidence-based multichannel social and behavior change (SBC) strategy may contribute to promoting, adopting, and maintaining healthy sexual and reproductive behavior. Eleven studies aimed at using digital technology to improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes were identified. Although only three of the five studies that tracked changes in contraceptive behavior documented statistically significant increases in modern contraceptive use, nearly all studies showed positive changes in at least one intermediate outcome, such as knowledge and self-efficacy. Studies that examined the effects of digital health programming on modern contraceptive use were implemented in Cambodia, India, Mozambique, and Nigeria. The results led to this brief being classified as “promising.”</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Although the number of peer-reviewed manuscripts and grey literature focusing on the use of digital health for family planning programs or to improve family planning outcomes has increased slightly since 2013, it remains surprisingly low. The current evidence suggests a promising future for using digital technology to enhance the provision and use of family planning, but further research is needed to understand whether the use of digital applications (e.g., SMS, IVR, social media) positively impacts contraceptive behavior change in the long term. Questions that were identified from the evidence review to address in future research include understanding which digital health platforms are most effective; understanding the cost, reach, and potential for sustainability of using digital health applications in different contexts; understanding under what circumstances the use of digital health interventions in family planning can be most cost-effective at the provider-level; and understanding under what circumstances digital applications can be more cost effective than non-digital interventions. By continuing to expand the evidence base to answer these questions, we can determine how to best use digital technology as a tool for improving family planning outcomes for those who need it most.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Uganda, there is widespread knowledge on at least one method of modern contraception. According to the 2016 Uganda Demographic Health Survey, more than 99% of all women, and all married people have knowledge of any method of contraception.</p><p>Informed choice on all methods of contraception remains low—with only 62.7% of all users informed about side effects or problems of method used; only 57.3% are informed of what to do when they experience side effects and only 74% are informed about other methods.</p><p>Of the 45% of contraception users who discontinue use after one year, the majority-18.1%, do so due to the side effects. This could be prevented by availing correct and comprehensive information on contraception choices, enabling informed choice.</p><p>Government health centres are the second most common source of information on family planning (41.8%, after public sources at 58.5%). Ideally, health providers at these health centers should carry out in depth counselling on contraception, but very often, get overwhelmed by clients, and focus on the basic information.</p><p>According to the Uganda National IT Survey 2017/2018 released by the National Information Technology in 2018, 70.9 per cent of Ugandans own mobile phones.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>PSI Uganda (PSIU) partnered with Human Network International (HNI) to develop key health messages on contraception, to be hosted on The 161 Service, a mobile info-service that allows people to access important information with their own phone, in local languages, 24 hours a day whenever they need across a range of topics in either voice or text format.</p><p>PSIU worked with behavior change communication specialists from the Ministry of Health and development partners to develop messages on contraception methods, benefits and side effects, choosing the right method, dispelling myths and misconceptions, and where to access contraception.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Health messages on contraception, having been pretested for comprehension and acceptability in the different languages, were made available to all Airtel Uganda subscribers (9 million users) on November 20 2017 and data shared will be for the first three months from uploading the messages. Airtel Uganda promotes the 1-6-1 Service to low income subscribers via SMS in local languages on a weekly basis to driver users to The 161 Service. The 161 Service in turn collects metadata on all calls, SMS and USSD requests tracking message selection, call volume, percent of message listened to, repeat users.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>There were 133,922 interactions from 15,760 unique users with the 161 service during the aforementioned three month period. Of the total number of interactions, over 62,000 (46.8%) selected family planning, while 34% and 18% selected maternal health and cervical cancer messages respectively.</p><p>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is the preferred mode of delivery of the messages with more than 88% of the audience selecting voice over SMS and USSD (text formats).</p><p>Of the total number of Family Planning interactions (over 62,000), at least 93 percent listened or read the messages to the end. The most popular sub category under the Family Planning menu was “Family Planning Methods” at 45.5%, followed by the “Benefits and Side Effects” at 27.7%. “Emergency Contraceptive Use” came in third at 8.6%, followed by “Men and Family Planning” at 7%.</p><p>Under the methods, people most accessed the Short Term methods at 47.2% (19,341 interactions), followed by long term methods, natural methods and permanent methods at 31.6%, 11.6% and 9.6% respectively.</p><p>Of the callers who selected to listen to Health messages, 81% provided their age, gender, and location. Within that population, youth aged 18-24 made up the majority (56.4%) of listeners; while the percentage of men to women was 54 to 46 respectively.</p><p>Language variation of access was significantly skewed with 48% of callers accessing messages in Luganda (Central Uganda language) and 37% in Runyakitara (South Western Uganda languages) while English, Ateso, Luo, Lugbara (Eastern and Northern Uganda languages) accounted for less than 14% of the total population of listeners.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>When seeking information on family planning, given the option, people tend to prefer an audio format to text.</p><p>47.5% of callers accessed information on short term methods while 31.4% selected long term methods from the contraceptives menu within the family planning content on The 161 Service. Within long term methods, the divide is evenly split between the implant and the IUD under while for listeners who select short term methods, oral contraception information is the most popular subject with more than twice as many selections as compared to injectables, male condoms, female condoms, and emergency contraception.</p><p>Younger people tended to access the system more than any other age group making this channel of communication (a mobile on-demand information service) an appropriate channel of reaching them. Over 75% of the country’s population is below the age of 30, and at least 25% of the women in this age group already have a child, and therefore may be particularly interested in information on birth spacing.</p><p>The language use indicates a preference for local languages over English. Additionally, most of the users who have utilized The 161 Service are from Central and Western Uganda, which are economically stronger than the other language counterparts-Ateso, Luo, Lugbara (Eastern and Northern Uganda languages). This finding may lead to further research on whether this is a factor of promotion of messages across languages and target audiences; or the people in the regions in question do have access to, at least, a basic phone.</p>",

      "title": "Turning on the Power of  Digital for Family Planning",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>It is a best practice in social behavior change communication to integrate content and messages across multiple, interactive channels including community engagement, mass media, local and traditional media and  interpersonal/peer  communication. Now as we settle into the 21st century, digital media is commonplace; even multiple digital platforms can be put into play to reach wider audiences and stimulate personal engagement and community participation, as well as model social norms to motivate behavior change toward FP adoption and continuation. This is highly relevant in Indonesia where smart phone ownership and social media use is among the highest in the world, thus making digital platforms a compelling approach to reach audiences with FP information and triggers to action across the island nation.</p><p>Indonesia is the largest Muslim and the fourth most populous country in the world. While Indonesia has a high mCPR of 57% (DHS’17) it has plateaued and even decreased over the past 10 years. New generations of women have not been introduced to FP with a modern spin, and LARCS are not well known.  Only 13.4 percent of women have been using long acting and permanent methods, while unmet need is estimated at 10.6% (DHS ’17).          </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To take advantage of the infiltration of digital communication into everyday lives, we are maximizing the use of digital platforms under the MyChoice initiative designed to reach women with an expanded choice of family planning methods to suit her and her partner’s choice. Client demand approaches are integrated together with improved postpartum FP services along with supply chain improvements to reach women with an expanded choice of methods at different life stages including LARCS, referred to at <strong><em>Right Method, Right Time, My Choice.   </em></strong></p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The MyChoice initiative is focused in 11 districts in four provinces across three islands. The integrated demand-supply initiative began in 2015. We have woven together a “trans-digital” strategy with 5 interrelated, yet distinct, digital platforms: 1) mobile app for newlyweds/new FP adopters; 2) mobile friendly website; 3) range of social media  (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube); 4) outreach tablet for peri-urban community outreach workers from the two largest religious networks; and 5) job aid tablet  using the Better Counseling Strategy (BCS) for postpartum midwife clinic counselors;</p><p> While the digital platforms contains specific content tailored to each audience and platform, there is core FP content adapted for each platform, be it a newlywed playing the life planning simulation game using the Skata mobile app, or Facebook users participating in FB Live discussions on-line, to groups of peri-urban Muslim women talking about the benefits of FP in community settings, to midwives helping a woman through post partum FP adoption. Each platform facilitates the audience to view content based on their interests, ask questions, or find a nearby midwife provider.  When content is updated for the SKATA app, updates also appear on the website and social media platforms. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Usage of the various digital platforms has grown steadily over the life of the project: 1) 49,000 downloads of the Skata app; 2) 251,000 visits to the mobile friendly website; 3) 5.3 million people reached on Facebook; 4) close to 100,000 people reached on Instagram; 211,000 reached via Twitter; 5) 621,000 women reached at the community level; 5) 55% (increased to 80% in the last year) of women  giving birth in  the 95 delivery facilities have been counseled with the post partum  FP tablet; half of those adopted a method -75% of which were LARCS. Social Behavior Change Communication via these digital platforms has contributed to 3.4% increase in LARC method uptake in the 11 districts (midterm survey 2016).</p><p>These digital platforms are being scaled up in large part by local counterparts at the national, provincial and district levels. The community outreach tablet is being adapted and scaled up nationally by the Indonesia government partner (BKKBN) to 5,500 outreach workers on their mobile phones, tablets and laptops. The PPFP provider platform is being scaled up to 25 more districts in the four provinces. A counseling tablet using the BCS approach is being developed for nationwide use in all FP services in 2019. Additionally, the Government of Indonesia recognizes the importance of reaching married and unmarried youth and supports the development of an interactive micro website site adapted for youth in collaboration with an existing web provider. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Digital platforms are a powerful approach to reach audiences, standardize content and messages across platforms, synergize and adapt content in real time with insights and lessons learned from audience reactions and interactions. For instance, community outreach workers have been trained in crafting stories about women in their communities which can be shared on social media as well as posted on the website. Thus, stories and testimonials of real life experiences infuse across the digital platforms.</p><p>The  team knew that social media was popular—Indonesia has among the highest numbers of Facebook users in the world. Indonesians like to be connected and feel the assurance from their social networks- social media supports this cultural tendency. Thus, it is not surprising that the social media outlets have been popular for the MyChoice content.</p><p>After an initial training, the community outreach workers were confident in using the interactive tablet which proved to be an asset with community women. In addition to being an appealing and useful tool, the tablet lent credibility to the outreach workers themselves. In the PPFP clinics, the midwives  conducting post partum counseling reported that using the tablet was a more efficient way to provide counseling to the clients.</p><p>Learning from one digital platform and applying these insights to other digital vehicles  has enabled the team to take advantage of the interconnectivity in real time thereby having flexibility to reach women and men with what they are looking for at the right moment they need it.  </p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "Despite of increasing commitment, many women in Uganda who want to avoid or space pregnancy are not using FP methods. 28% of currently married and 32 % of sexually active unmarried women have an unmet need for FP. Although nearly 7 in every 10 married women and nearly 9 in every 10 sexually active unmarried women have demand for FP, only 39% of married women and 51% of sexually active unmarried women use a contraceptive method (UDHS2016).  A Study by population council 2015 revealed that 38% of women with an unmet need for modern contraception in Uganda have used a modern method in the past but have chosen to discontinue use. On average, over one-third of women who start using a modern contraceptive method stop using within the first year and over one-half stop before two years. More than half of discontinuations are among women experiencing contraceptive failure or have method-related problems associated with its use. Myths and rumors contribute a significant share to non use and discontinuation. In the face of the above, Health Child in 2016 invented the women mobile lifeline channel that enables  sharing of timely, actionable and personalized FP information and feedback with women.",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "Women Mobile Lifeline Channel is a single-window application uploaded on mobile phones with multiple channels on FP methods, timing of use, dos &amp;don’ts, possible side effects and their management. Information is delivered to women through interactive edutainment tools that builds on their knowledge to create awareness, preempt use and supports continuation. The app enables registration of women, voicing of audio supported messages, auto-calculation of return dates, prompt reporting and response to issues in addition connects and enables interaction of women, VHTs and health workers and enables submission of reports on the dashboard.",
      "methodology": "Health Child piloted the Women Mobile Lifeline Channel in 6 health centre IVs in Jinja district, Uganda offering comprehensive family planning services. The project targeted postnatal women aged 15-49. Two contact midwives and 5 VHTs were selected, trained and given Women Mobile Lifeline- connected mobile phones at each of the implementing health facility. Recruitment of women on the Women Mobile Lifeline platform was done by VHTs using connected phones at the health centre through exit interviews staged during postnatal, immunization and family clinic days. Women already on a method and those not were considered for inclusion. Data was collected at baseline (September 2016) and at end line (March 2018) using a questionnaire uploaded on a connected phone and at both stages contracepting profile of women was taken. VHTs at recruitment only teased out women that reside in their catchment zones for easy tracking. After recruitment, VHTs made bi-monthly follow up home visits involving phone based voicing of messages on FP methods, timing of use, dos &amp;don’ts,  side effects and their management and submitted report of challenges of use  to the dashboard viewed by the midwives and in turn midwives provides advice or makes recommendations.  Overall 312 women were studied.",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "Both at baseline and end line, information on knowledge of contraception was collected by asking women to name ways or methods by which an individual can delay or avoid pregnancy. All women had heard of at least one modern method of contraception however, only 20% at baseline had knowledge of 3 or more methods as opposed to 84% end-line.  66% of women at baseline reported to have ever used a method but only 23% were on a method at the point of recruitment. 27% reported desire for another child, 54% method challenges while 13 others as the reason for discontinuation at baseline. Contraception rate increased from 23% at base line to 56% end line. During the course of implementation 17% discontinuation was recorded of which 61% was due to desire for another child, 12% partner opposition, 15% side effects and 12% others. One critical determinant of adoption and continuation of contraceptives is the overall client understanding and satisfaction with the method and the perceived available support mechanism in the face of a challenge as such, accelerating use and continuation of FP services requires expanded access to timely and accurate contextualized information as well as reliable platforms for continuous follow up support and this can only be achieved through  the adoption of cost effective, scalable  and localized appropriate mobile technologies.",

In the recent past, Uganda like many other developing countries have adopted and made several attempts to scale up ICT integration in health as one of the strategies for accelerating progress however, most of these ICT tools have tended to only focus at awareness creation, reporting and trucking of health indicators with less focus on stimulating two-way and sustainable mobile based interactions that reinforce behavior change and as a result, healthcare seeking patterns including FP uptake  and continuation have persistently remained low. For that reason therefore, efforts now ought to be expanded  to adopt  phone-based applications that allows for mobile interactions, follow up and feedback between VHTs, the woman and the midwife, one that allows for auto-detection registration, auto-reporting of side effects or challenges of use, auto-detection of missed appointments, auto-calculation of return dates, mobile data collection and prompt submission. As such, the Women Mobile Lifeline Channel that Health Child is implementing offers lenses for Uganda and other countries to walk towards meaningful ICT integration in health.",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Health Network quality improvement system (HNQIS) is an android based application created by Population Services International to replace paper based system and is primarily used by Quality Assurance Officers (QAOs) in support supervisions. The tool, made up of checklists, is used to assess quality of care of provider’s services, measure proficiencies in respective skills areas and highlight missed critical steps. The overall aim is to plan, asses, and monitor and improve supervisions. This replaced the paper based system that was bulky, prone to fires, easily altered, hard to store, update and review.</p><p>A number of studies have shown that improved use of Information and Communication Technology can greatly enhance health services delivery in developing countries.</p><p>In Uganda, the low number of health care providers at the Family planning Clinics are attributed to high rates of attrition. These means that every now and then the new providers in the PSI social franchise clinics will need support with on job training and skills assessment so as to improve the Quality of care given to clients attending family planning clinics. This therefore requires an efficient system in offering continuous support to these providers so as to improve the Quality of Care scores.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>It is hypothesized that use of modern technology improves health service monitoring, supervision and delivery. This document therefore tells the story of how computer based applications such as HNQIS affect the delivery and monitoring of healthcare services being provided at the point of care which are the franchise clinics (PROFAMS) with special focus on Intra Uterine Device, Implants, Combined Oral contraceptives as well as assessment of Work environment, Cervical cancer screening, client records. This paper aims at answering the question “Have E-system based applications like HNQIS led to significant improvement in the quality of service offered to the populations they</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The methodology involved analysis of data from the Strategic and Learning department of PSI Uganda.</p><p>This data was collected from exit interviews among female clients exiting the facilities over a two week period. The baseline survey was done in April 2017 approximately the same time HNQIS was rolled out as a support supervision tool the second survey eight months later in November/December 2017.</p><p>The respondents over the two surveys included female clients seeking family planning services at Profam Franchise clinics profiled by age, level of education, marital status, number of living children and the wealth quantile. Respondents interviewed also asked the services intended to receive, services received, knowledge of the facility, and reason for choice of method.</p><p>Other questions were in regards to appointment convenience, costing and hygiene, privacy and confidentiality, attitude of staff, attention and affordability. The overall satisfaction was then computed with scores for client expectation met, client expectation exceeded satisfaction and experience.</p><p>This was individually done for all the four PSI regions of operations within Uganda.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results from client exit interviews across the four PSI Uganda regions conducted in April 2017 and November/December 2017 were then compared to see if there was any significant change from the time of introduction of HNQIS.</p><p>The exit interview results, comparing client perceptions between April and December showed an overall Quality of Care score improvement from 84.3% -88.0%, 78%-90% and 64.2% to 93.1% in the central, Eastern and southwestern regions with sample values n=445,246 and 29 respectively.</p><p>There was also marked improvement in services exceeding client expectations with 67.5%, 60% and 58.6% in December for the Central, Eastern and Southwestern regions up from 35.4%, 36.6% and 37.3% respectively in April.</p><p>In terms of client expectations 98.8%, 95%, 93.3% and 100% of the sampled clients expressed satisfaction with the services in the Central, eastern, Northern and southwestern Regions in December compared to 94%, 85.4%, 87.7% and 91% in the April exit interviews.</p><p>From these deductions, there was clear improvement in the perception of service delivery and client satisfaction between March/April 2017 and November/December 2017 suggesting a direct correlation between use of E-system based support supervision tool and client satisfaction</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Information and communication technologies seem to be increasingly becoming an integral part of healthcare management and supervision.</p><p>The application of electronic data collection and dissemination tools such as HNQIS greatly improves program monitoring and conducting support supervisions. This makes it easier to address the skills gaps resulting to greater quality of service and client satisfaction.</p><p>E-Systems, such as HNQIS, should eventually be rolled out to cover several PSI programmatic areas and not just family planning. This would greatly improve the quality of supervision of such programs as well as achieving the clients/consumer satisfaction.</p><p>For the long term sustainability plan-E-Systems such as HNQIS should be integrated into the public healthcare sector given the fact that they handle the higher volume of client loads but often have low quality of care. Progressive use of this tool is most likely to boost program performance and achieve greater impact in the long run.</p><p>This tool is therefore very important for PSI program implementers and may as well be adopted into other PSI supported programs.</p>",

      "title": "Can mobile outreach teams safely deliver long-acting reversible contraception and permanent methods in rural and peri-urban areas: a prospective cohort study from Tanzania",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Tanzania has high unmet need for family planning (FP), 22% in 2015, with only 10.4% of women using long-acting reversible contraceptives and permanent methods (LARC-PMs). In 2017, 671,664 women were using contraception from Marie Stopes Tanzania (MST), an estimated 36% of all contraception supplied to women in Tanzania.</p><p>MST delivers nearly all (96%) of its family planning provision through mobile outreach. 46 teams visit government facilities every 2-4 months, employing either MST or government MST-trained providers. These teams operate in remote, rural areas where there has been no previous service delivery of LARC-PMs. MST also operates 13 auto-rickshaw (Bajaji) vehicles who deliver LARC-PM in rural and peri-urban areas. A challenge with mobile outreach is ensuring care continuity between visits, especially if clients require support, follow-up, or device removal. Clients requiring follow-up are advised to return to the public sector delivery site if experiencing complications, but these facilities usually keep poor records and complication incidence is unclear through routine monitoring.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We therefore designed a cohort study to assess whether MST’s outreach services are delivering LARC-PMs with adequate safety and quality of care. We also investigated client satisfaction with outreach services and one year LARC discontinuation rates.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Design:</p><p>Prospective longitudinal cohort study among outreach clients receiving LARC-PM services, followed-up over one year (June 2016 to July 2017). The questionnaire was administered at facilities by trained government doctors/nurses (research assistants) among LARC-PM users aged 18-49 years.</p><p>Sites:</p><p>10 teams operating in 11 regions: eight outreach teams (eight regions: Mwanza, Ruvuma, Kilimanjaro, Rukwa, Singida, Iringa, Katavi, Mtwara) and two Bajaji providers (three regions: Mkoa Magharibi, Kusini Magharibi, Mjini Magharibi).</p><p>Sampling:</p><p>Probability proportion to size. The sample achieved was 819 women (TL=228, IUD=228, implant=366); 115 (14.0%) women were lost to follow-up (TL clients=7.0% after 15 days, implant/IUD clients=17.3% after one year).</p><p>Outcomes:</p><p>Primary outcome: Prevalence of adverse events during the procedure (intra-operative), directly afterwards (peri-operative) or during the subsequent 15 days. (Bajaji clients were excluded in clinical event analyses due to data quality problems).</p><p>Secondary outcomes: client satisfaction, measured on the procedure day across several domains (whole experience, counselling, pain management, procedure), and discontinuation.</p><p>Analysis:</p><p>Cross-tabulations of variables tested for significance using χ2 tests. Comparison of averages tested using t-tests (mean, two groups), one-way analysis of variance (mean, more than two groups) and Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests (median). All analyses were conducted in Stata 14.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Study population characteristics:</p><ul>\t<li>average age 30.5 years;</li>\t<li>68.5% primary education, 25.8% none;</li>\t<li>88.0% married;</li>\t<li>40.4% five or more children;</li>\t<li>83.0% worked in agriculture/fishing</li>\t<li>56.4% live on less than the national average income</li></ul><p>Two major clinical events occurred (0.3%), 25 clients experienced a moderate event (3.5%). Minor events were more common (n=236, 32.8%), mostly classified as normal/expected side-effects. No failed procedures occurred. Moderate/major events:</p><ul>\t<li>Implant:\t<ul>\t\t<li>Intra-operative: moderate pain (0.4%)</li>\t\t<li>Peri-operative: none</li>\t\t<li>Post-procedure: moderate bleeding (0.4%), moderate fever (0.4%), moderate prolonged bleeding (0.4%), major prolonged menses (0.4%)</li>\t</ul>\t</li>\t<li>IUD:\t<ul>\t\t<li>Intra-operative: none</li>\t\t<li>Peri-operative: moderate pain (0.5%)</li>\t\t<li>Post-procedure: moderate pain (0.5%), moderate intermittent vaginal bleeding (0.5%)</li>\t</ul>\t</li>\t<li>TL:\t<ul>\t\t<li>Intra-operative: moderate pain (5.8%), moderate bleeding (0.4%)</li>\t\t<li>Peri-operative: moderate pain (2.2%)</li>\t\t<li>Post-procedure: major wound itching (0.5%)</li>\t</ul>\t</li></ul><p>More TL clients experienced moderate/major events than implant/IUD clients (8.4%, 1.8%, 1.4%, respectively, p<ul>\t<li>doctor/medical assistant (MA) and nurse (87.3%)</li>\t<li>doctor/MA alone (33.3%)</li>\t<li>doctor/MA and midwife (44.9%)</li></ul><p>In the event of complications, 95.6% believed they received enough information about what to do. 30 clients experienced a post-procedure complication: 11 (36.7%) sought treatment, mostly from government facilities (n=8, 72.7%).</p><p>Discontinuation was low (3.9% over 12 months, no difference by method). Main reasons:</p><ul>\t<li>partners decision (n=5, 26.3%)</li>\t<li>discomfort (n=4, 21.1%)</li></ul><p>Client satisfaction was high:</p><ul>\t<li>35.8% satisfied</li>\t<li>64.2% very satisfied</li>\t<li>99.2% would recommend the service.</li></ul><p></p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results of this study are encouraging regarding the quality of LARC-PM services provided by MST outreach and Bajaji delivery models, and show that these services can be safely delivered through outreach delivery in mostly very rural locations. Variation in clinical event prevalence observed between regions, and combinations of provider cadres for TL clients, suggests, however, that the consistency of quality can be further improved. The latter finding is difficult to interpret due to low numbers of procedures performed by some cadre combinations and the reasons for the difference in outcomes between combinations were not explored by the study. There is scope for further investigation and research to establish whether this finding is consistent, both across MST and more broadly across MSI.</p><p>The majority of women said they received enough information about what to do if they experienced complications which is encouraging regarding counselling. The actions women would take aligned well with the actions that clients did take if they experienced complications and sought care, with visiting government facilities the most common action. This suggests that follow-up care options are available when MST outreach teams are not present, however this should also be interpreted with caution due to the low number of clients experiencing complications.</p><p>The study showed high client satisfaction suggesting that acceptability is high among women receiving these services. Low discontinuation rates across the study period are encouraging regarding client counselling and suggest that the availability of these services is highly valued by rural and peri-urban women in Tanzania.</p>",

      "title": "Early Lessons from implementing the Clinical Safety checklist for female sterilization in 5 States of India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>o Female sterilization is the most accepted method of contraception in India. Nearly 4 million female sterilization procedures are performed annually (HMIS; FY 2016-17) contributing to the largest share of modern contraceptive usage. Despite it being a simple and safe procedure, risk of complications, death and failure remain unacceptably high in most states of India, where services are provided by non-observance and/or poor compliance to prescribed standards. The problem is further exaggerated by limited access to institutional services provided in camp mode as compared to fixed day service (FDS) mode. As part of an initiative to address quality of care in family planning services, clinical safety checklist for female sterilization was introduced to improve client safety and experience. The tool attempts to prevent and identify potential errors that can take place from client admission to discharge. This checklist was conceptualized, developed and implemented in focal districts of 5 Indian States against the background knowledge that the WHO checklist for safe surgery has potential to reduce adverse events in surgery. With its introduction, expected impact over time is reduction in failure and adverse events following female sterilization, by improving the culture of client safety, early detection of potential near-misses and overall improved peri-operative</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Baseline data on current practices in intervention facilities was collected. An iterative process was followed to draft the safety checklist as a simple bilingual tool, as per the latest Government of India guidelines for female sterilization and evidence-based best practices. It was reviewed and approved by individual State technical working groups and then formally introduced through a comprehensive implementation strategy. First to a wide audience, comprising administrators, facility managers, doctors and staff nurses in State and district level workshops and then at individual facilities with members of the core surgical team who would be directly involved in using the tool.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Clinical Safety Checklist was introduced in 186 public health facilities of 6 focal districts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh and 1 district each of Maharashtra, Assam and Telangana States of India. The selected regions represent a geographic spread from East, Central, North, West and Southern parts of the country. Program teams met facility staff to give an overview of the checklist while thoroughly orienting those directly involved in providing these services in small groups, starting January 2017. Assam and Maharashtra obtained government approvals later and implementation started in June 2017. Organized around 4 pause points, that correspond to client flow at the facility from registration, pre-operative assessment, surgery, recovery to discharge, the checklist was designed to involve nurses in a bigger role and support shared team work. In the first few months of implementation, this ‘classroom’ orientation on all pause points of constituent data elements was followed by a 'hands-on' activity involving staff assisting in surgery and providing post-operative care. Members of the program and technical team were present in the facility on FDS days to guide and support staff in using the checklist, clarify doubts and answer queries. In all, 1272 doctors and nurses were trained on use of the checklist.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 15562 clinical safety checklists were filled for 30337 Minilap surgeries between January 2017 and January 2018. Overall compliance was 51%, varying from State to State. Compliance increased when program teams were physically present at the facility on FDS days. Disaggregated by pause point, pause-1 (client assessment at admission) was filled in 82%, pause-2 (pre-operative and intra-operative) in 74%, pause-3 (post-operative) in 70% and pause-4 (at discharge) in 66%.</p><p>Pause-1 to be filled by doctors was actually filled by nurses who when observed, lacked capacity to assess fitness for surgery. Key safety indicators checked for and filled in the checklist were: Fasting status and surgical fitness in 84%. Intra-operative vitals measured in 48%. Verifying client had emptied her bladder just before beginning the procedure in 52%. Recommended drugs given for sedation and analgesia in 35% of filled checklists. Most surgeries (76%) were done under local anaesthesia (LA) in which 48% checked if xylocaine was diluted, 48% if dose was calculated as recommended and 49% checked for satisfactory anaesthetic effect. Post-operative vitals were measured in 55% cases at the time of shifting to recovery which further dropped to 38% in the remaining post-op period. Dressing was checked for soakage in 33% of filled checklists. Doctors signed off in 73% while nurses in 60% of designated sections of the checklist. Data triangulation done by simultaneous filling of the checklist by program staff on some FDS days revealed various inaccuracies (inter-rater agreement of 57%, &gt;80% for 7 out of total 22 data elements.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Despite initial misgivings and perception of increased work-load, the checklist received enthusiastic support from various stakeholders. However several barriers to smooth uptake at facility level have been identified thus far. Acute shortage of HR, frequent staff-turnover, resistance to changing habits, confusion about how to use the checklist correctly and perceived lack of importance of ensuring completeness were the key ones. Some took it more seriously, while others saw it as a mere ‘tick-box’’ exercise. Inaccuracies in filled checklists were primarily attributed to staff’s lack of competence to correctly perform or check assigned tasks and steep hierarchy in the OT with hesitation by nurses to mark a task not done by a surgeon. Signing off individual sections was also not done for fear of litigation in case something goes wrong. A rigorous implementation plan is required to ensure routine and correct use of the checklist. Developing a roster with defined roles and responsibilities of members of the surgical team, providing competency based training to build ancillary staff capacity, cultivating local champions to drive the process enthusiastically and frequent audit and feedback of analysed data in quality circle meetings (facility based quality improvement mechanisms) are some identified strategies that need further strengthening. The WHO checklist serves as a good start point for advocating to policymakers to adopt similar approaches for standardizing and improving safety of female sterilization procedure. However implementation is not so straightforward and requires broad based buy-in, with willingness to adopt a safety culture beyond sharpening technical skills. Importance of team work cannot be over-emphasized.</p>",

      "title": "Introducing and scaling up a quality improvement collaborative for community-based family planning: a process evaluation of a health system-wide improvement network in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>High quality family planning (FP) services have been associated with increased FP service demand and use resulting in improved health outcomes for women. Community-based family planning (CBFP) is a key strategy to expanding access to a range of FP services through community health workers (CHWs). FHI 360, in partnership with Uganda’s Ministry of Health, established the first CBFP learning site in Busia district, Uganda using a quality improvement collaborative (QIC) model. The goal was to create a network within a district health system that has a high-functioning CBFP program with CHWs as core providers of FP services. The objective was to increase the uptake and continuation of FP services and then to scale-up the QIC in Uganda. QI collaboratives are often disease-focused, driven by clinical processes and occur at the health center level. Evaluations of QICs in Sub-Saharan Africa are limited and to our knowledge, there is no documentation in the published literature, or the Ugandan national health strategies, of QICs which target community-based service delivery models. FHI 360 conducted a process evaluation to understand the adaptation process of the QIC, supportive factors for the implementation of the collaborative, and trends in QI indicators of FP uptake and retention.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>FHI 360 designed a QIC to increase client retention and improve FP counseling. The collaborative was implemented in Busia district and later scaled up to Oyam district. Features included: clear improvement aim and objectives, improvement monitoring, QI teams, a coaching system to mentor teams testing changes and measuring their effects, the plan-do-study-act (PDSA)-based improvement model, change package, and learning sessions to share experiences. QI teams consisted of district health managers, facility staff, and CHWs. The process evaluation looked at the adaptation process, supportive factors for implementation, and trends in QI indicators of FP uptake and retention.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We collected data from two program districts: Busia (learning site) and Oyam (scale-up) districts. Busia district is in Eastern Uganda and Oyam district is a relatively new rural district in northern Uganda. We used a descriptive mixed methods process evaluation design including the following components: desk review of program documents; de-identified program monitoring data from October 2014 to December 2016;; and, qualitative research methods. We conducted 21 in-depth interviews (IDI) and 13 focus group discussions (FGD) with VHTs, district representatives, health center staff, and CBFP clients in the districts’ QI learning areas, as well as with representatives from the Quality Assurance Department in the MOH.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The evaluation found that the QI process strengthened the linkages between the health services provided in communities with that of health centers. The routine interaction of CHWs, clients, midwives provided ideas of changes or improvements. Participants reported increased learning through CHW-midwife mentorship, supportive supervision, monthly meetings, data interpretation, and learning sessions. The process evaluation identified three areas for potential sustainability and institutionalization of the QI efforts: the integration of QI into other service areas; district level plans and support including QI in general and for CBFP; and motivation of QI teams, especially CHWs and midwives. Challenges that should be considered in the replication of this model include community level capacity for data recording and interpretation and simplifying the language to enable CHWs to be comfortable with QI terminology and tools, and travel reimbursements for QI meetings. Although it seems that CHWs, midwifes saw a benefit through team work and mentorship, the cost of travel and time for CHWs, who are volunteers, should be reimbursed more adequately. The districts showed progressive improvement in CBFP service delivery starting in February 2016 due to increased competence of the CHWs in identifying and implementing change ideas following an exchange visit. We identified trends and shifts in the data to determine whether the change was a sustainable improvement over time. The evaluation found positive trends in the number of women on a family planning method, the number of returning clients, and the number of couples counseled.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This evaluation shows that the QIC can be an effective approach to improve service delivery by CHWs, specifically the uptake and continuation of FP methods. Working with CHWs on a QIC presents different challenges compared to working at the facility level. In Uganda, CHWs are volunteers, semi-literate and had no previous data analysis experience. However, we found their enthusiasm and creativity that is important to improving processes. Additionally, our data suggests QICs can increase uptake and retention of clients on FP. To strengthen the implementation of this CBFP QIC and other community-based QIC, we recommend the following:</p><p>• Embed QI in the community health worker curriculum.</p><p>• Incorporate data recording, plotting data and interpretation into CHWs’ and midwives’ training.</p><p>• Engage clients as key stakeholders in the improvement effort</p><p>• Conduct inter-facility and inter-district joint learning sessions to increase CHWs initiative, desire to perform better and accelerate adaptation of proven change ideas.</p><p>• Recognize the contributions of CHWs and provide them with transport stipends to enable them to submit reports regularly.</p><p>• Include budgets for CBFP and QI initiatives in family planning costed implementation plans.</p><p>• Have an integrated QI approach at facility level, so that the CBFP QI efforts work in complement to other QI projects for non-FP services.</p><p>• Consider stock availability and building the capacity of CHWs and midwives to forecast their supply needs as quality improves and so does demand for services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Examining women’s contraceptive behaviors and facility-level activities when programs end is important for informing strategies for the design and implementation of scalable and sustainable family planning programs. This presentation presents the sustainability of the Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative two years after the program ended in one city (Ilorin) and continued in another city (Kaduna).  This paper is unique because rarely do programs examine program sustainability post-program completion.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The family planning indicators from the city where the program ended (Ilorin) will be worse two years post-program completion as compared to the city where the program completed.  This will be true for household-level measures of contraceptive use as well as for facility-level indicators of program quality and accessiblity.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Representative cross-sectional household surveys were collected in the two cities in 2017 using a two-stage sampling design.  All women ages 15-49 who spent the previous night in the household were eligible for interview.  A total of 6,882 women were interviewed across the two cities.  Data from the two cities in 2017 are used to examine distinctions in program exposure across sites and to investigate how exposure relates to key outcomes including the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (MCPR).  In addition, cross-sectional data from 2010/11, 2015 and 2017 in Ilorin and Kaduna are used to examine how trends in MCPR and program exposure differ in the two scenarios represented by Kaduna and Ilorin. </p><p>Data are also available from facilities in the study cities. Facility quality is examined at all time points and a determination of how quality changes over time is examined in NURHI and non-NURHI facilities.  </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Descriptive results demonstrate that at the city level there are few differences in contraceptive use among women in union across sites in 2017 (MCPR is about 31% in both sites). Examination of MCPR among non-Muslim women demonstrates no differences in use across cities.  Among Muslim women, use is highest in Ilorin followed by Kaduna.  These distinctions remain in multivariate analyses controlling for key demographic distinctions across cities.  Preliminary regressions examining MCPR over time (from 2015 to 2017) in Ilorin and Kaduna demonstrate a significant positive effect of program exposure on use.  After controlling for these positive exposure results and demographic differences, no significant change in MCPR is found in Kaduna from 2015 to 2017 and a small, positive increase is found in Ilorin. </p><p>Multivariate models examining facility-level data demonstrate that in 2017, the quality of services is higher in Kaduna than in Ilorin; this is true for an overall quality measure as well as for specific measures of provider training and availability of methods in the facilities. In Ilorin, comparing services between 2015 and 2017 demonstrates little change in service quality since the program ended in 2015. When examining the volume of clients (adjusted for the size of the facility), Kaduna in 2017 has the highest volume as do the NURHI facilities. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The findings from this presentation can inform future urban reproductive health program strategies seeking to develop intervention activities that are scaled-up and sustained beyond the donor-funded project.  The presentation discusses how the results can inform future programs and research seeking to affect Sustainable Development Goals related to universal access to sexual and reproductive health. </p>",

      "title": "Assessment of a pilot project to introduce community-based provision of injectables in Benin",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Republic of Benin has historically had low rates of contraceptive use with an mCPR of 15.7% and an unmet need of 33.7%. Family planning indicators in Benin lag behind other sub-Saharan African countries. At the 2013 ICFP meeting, the Republic of Benin pledged to increase its mCPR to 20% by 2018.</p><p>In 2014, after two years of advocacy under the USAID-funded Advancing Partners &amp; Communities (APC) project, the Benin Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Mother and Child Health Directorate (DSME) approved a pilot project to allow <em>aides-soignantes</em>, a para-professional cadre of nurses’ aid stationed at health centers that provides immunization outreach services, to administer injectable contraceptives at the community level. Until then, women could only access contraceptives at local health centers, thus limiting access to those in rural communities.</p><p>Global evidence shows that community health workers (CHWs) can safely and effectively provide injectable contraceptive services at the community level. In fact, community-based access to injectables (CBA2I) programming is recognized as a high impact practice that can expand access to contraception for women and families. Enabling easier access to family planning for Beninese women can accelerate the country toward its FP goals.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objectives of the pilot project were two-fold. First, the pilot sought to determine if trained CHWs, aides-soignantes, could safely and acceptably provide injectable contraceptive services at the community level. The second goal was to provide information to help the MOH decide whether community-based provision of injectables should be brought to scale and, if so, to provide guidance for scale-up.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The CBA2I pilot project took place from August 2015 to May 2016 in the Adja-Ouèrè commune in the Pobè/Adja-Ouèrè/Kétou health zone where the 2% mCPR was below the commune mCPR of 8%. The Adja-Ouèrè commune is predominantly rural, with a total population of 120,238. 81,338 people (52% women) live within the four boroughs where the pilot was implemented: Adja-Ouèrè, Ikpinlè, Ologo (Oko-Akaré), and Tatonnoukon. These sites were chosen because of the low mCPR and their proximity to central-level MOH structures and dynamic staff to enable ongoing supervision. There are 11 health centers in the commune, of which eight offered FP services at the start of the pilot.</p><p>The APC project trained national level master trainers, who then trained 23 aides-soignantes to administer Noristerat at the community and facility level. Services were provided over nine months.</p><p>The pilot was evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Structured interviews using a survey questionnaire were conducted with aides-soignantes and their family planning clients; data collectors directly observed injectable contraceptive provision in health centers; in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with FP clients; and, program records and service statistics were examined.</p><p>Data was collected between May 9-16, 2017.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Over the period of the pilot program, aides-soignantes provided FP counseling to 660 clients. Of these, 463 (70%) adopted an FP method and 449 (68%) of the FP adopters adopted Noristerat, demonstrating a greater increase in new injectable users compared to either before or after the intervention. Furthermore, health center service records showed an increase in new injectable users without corresponding decreases in new acceptors of other methods, suggesting that users were new to contraception, not substituting for another method.</p><p>Clients interviewed both by survey and through in-depth interviews were largely supportive of the services aides-soignantes provided. 93 percent of clients reported being very satisfied with the services they received and 95 percent would recommend the services to a friend or family member. However, several clients mentioned that although they were satisfied, they had concerns about community provision, as many women preferred the health center since it is more discreet.</p><p>Aides-soignantes were generally positive about the community-based provision of injectables and welcomed their new responsibilities. 95 percent reported that they felt more useful and 84 percent viewed their selection for the program as a promotion. They noted tasks they found burdensome and challenges they faced. Many cited discomfort using the Noristerat job aid and eligibility checklist. Direct observations of consultations between the aides-soignantes and clients show that they generally follow correct safety and good quality counseling procedures when administering injectables.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The findings from this pilot project assessment show that Beninese CHWs can successfully administer injectable contraceptives at the community level and that clients are satisfied with their services. Providing services where clients live increases access to contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies. Further, CBA2I programming has been shown to substantially increase the number of contraceptive users in many countries and national scale-up of the practice will undoubtedly accelerate progress towards the country’s current FP2020 commitment to reach an mCPR of 22% by 2020.</p><p>Importantly, these results will inform ongoing introduction of DMPA-SC (Sayana Press) under APC via the lowest level cadre of CHWs, known as <em>relais communautaires</em>. Lessons learned from this pilot implementation, particularly client reluctance to seek FP services in the community, are also applicable to other countries with a similar social and cultural context. It will be important to continue strong SBCC campaigns to address persistent cultural barriers and shift norms to increase FP uptake.</p><p>These results will be used to advocate to the MOH to officially change policy to allow CHWs to provide injectable contraception in Benin. Though CBA2I has been implemented and expanded in practice through APC’s community-based introduction of Sayana Press, a policy change will solidify the government’s lasting commitment to this standard of practice and ensure that marginalized populations have continued access to quality family planning services.</p>",

      "title": "Best practices are influencing policy change for lady health workers for Task shifting in Pakistan: A Case study",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Access to quality family planning services remain an issue in Pakistan. Although, the knowledge of modern contraceptive is 95%, only 35% women are using any form of contraception in Pakistan. Of these, 26% are using modern contraceptive methods, while the unmet need for family planning among currently married remain 20%.  To bridge the gap between knowledge and utilization (demand and supply), a Community Health Worker (CHW) model has been widely utilized in low middle-income countries. Evidence support the effectiveness of CHWs in delivering primary healthcare services at doorstep. At present, tasks shifting is another health intervention that is being implemented in Pakistan to promote Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR).  Resultantly, this intervention has enabled this cadre of providers to administer the first dose of injectables; however, meticulous attention was incurred during the advanced training of these CHWs to ensure that these community workers are not over burdened with the additional task and extraneous training exercises. Emphatically, this model has emerged as one of the most effective strategy to address human resource insufficiency  in health and an important tool to promote not only the CPR, but also in curbing the issue of high maternal and child mortality in Pakistan</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To reduce the unmet need for contraceptive use, the current study covered specific objectives to provide hands on practice for first dose of injections to Lady Health Workers (LHWs) and to train the LHWs on effective screening of the clients before the administration of the first dose of injectable contraceptives. For more than a decade LHWs were only allowed to give follow-up injections but the first injection was given by a mid-level provider which was a barrier as clients were reluctant to go to facilities for this service</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>During October 2016 to January 2017, three phases of training were conducted. In 1st phase;  with a focus on developing capacity of LHWs to independently provide the First dose of Injections, a detailed checklist was formulated by considering the category 3-4 of the MEC wheel to help LHWs in understanding the clients who are not eligible of DMPA dose. In 2nd phase; Information related to ineligible clients for DMPA dose was shared along with questions related to demographic details of the client. Furthermore, the category 3-4 of MEC wheel was referred, and a detailed checklist was formulated which was then translated into Urdu for the convenience of LHWs. This checklist contained 8 questions related to pregnancy, mother breastfeeding a child less than 6 weeks older, clients having a liver tumor or hepatitis, having heart problem, having venous thromboembolism or experiencing unexpected vaginal bleeding. In 3rd phase; a briefing was given to LHWs on the checklist. After they completed the checklist, they took clients to a service provider of Population Welfare Department (PWD) to countercheck it. After her approval of the clients’ eligibility of getting DMPA dose, LHW provided the dose to clients by following the instructions written on the checklist.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During the 7 months of intervention- 200 LHWs and 10 LHVs were trained to provide 1st does of injection at the doorstep of women living in urban squatter of Karachi.  These lady health workers were trained in three batches with the primary focus on client-centered family planning counselling approach to the screen eligible women for providing first dose of Injection at their doorstep. The uptake of first does of injection in the targeted community was doubled (from 1271 to 2028).  A total of 757 women have been severed so far in the targeted community.  Data from March to October 2017 reported 383 additional injection users, which shows an increase of 4 folds from the baseline, with an average increase of 54 clients per month.  Following the client centered family planning counselling, these LHWs were also trained to contribute in addressing the myths and misconceptions related to injection and other contraceptive methods in the community.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The training was well received by and large, and the participants appreciated the training methodology, environment and knowledge acquired through this intervention. So far, 200 LHWs have completed hands on training through screening activity where each LHW screened two clients in the presence of PWD service provider. They were comfortable to use the checklist to identify the right client for the right service. The First dose of Injections are now being administered since March 2017. Further results of training are being observed through monitoring the screening activity for provision of First dose of Injectable Contraceptives. The Sukh Initiative has witnessed worthwhile results from the field and recommendations have been shared with the Government to further replicate this initiative. Withal, the Sukh Initiative will continue to add value by developing capacity of LHWs and share learning from the field, by conducting refresher training for these LHWs.</p><p>Task shifting model mainly attributed to reduction in access barrier in the use of modern contraceptive in the community. Nevertheless, there is a dire need for development of clear policy and guidelines to regulate the same module for the provision of family planning services all over the country</p>",

      "title": "Expanding the provider pool for LARC and Abortion care services by engaging preservice institutions. The experience of Ipas Ethiopia, (January 2015 – December 2016)",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>A key strategy for improving the provision of comprehensive contraceptives,  including long acting and reversible contraceptives (LARC), and comprehensive abortion care (CAC) services, especially in rural areas, is to equip mid-level providers, (midwife/clinical nurses) with the knowledge and skill to provide ranges of LARC and CAC services. There is evidence that CAC and LARC services can be safely and effectively provided by these health professionals if they are properly trained and supported. According to Ethiopia’s national family planning and abortion guide line, midwives and clinical nurses are authorized to provide these services. However, graduates of these professionals are not trained in their preservice education and are not prepared to provide CAC/LARC services up on graduation. Moreover preservice institutions are not prepared to provide these trainings to their students.   They don’t have allocated adequate time for LARC and CAC training in their curriculum, instructors don’t have the knowledge and skill and the institutions don’t have the facilities for practical skill training.    In-service training on family planning and abortion care has been the major approach to address these gaps but is expensive and not sustainable.  To address these challenges, Ipas Ethiopia, in collaboration with Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) piloted inclusion</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Ipas collaborated with the Federal Ministry of Health and the universities of Mede Welabu, Mettu and Wollega to enable midwife and clinical nursing students acquire the knowledge, skill and positive attitude to provide LARC and CAC services as part of their preservice training. Ipas provided technical and financial support to universities to build capacity, revise curriculum to adequately include CAC and LARC issues, reorganize teaching and learning activities and produce midwives and clinical nurses that are competent and confident to provide LARC and CAC services.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We supported the three universities by providing training-of-trainer (TOT) course to 26 instructors teaching reproductive health courses to midwives and clinical nursing students, supported them to revise their curriculum and course syllabus so that it has adequate time for both class room and practical skill training to these professional cadres, Ipas provided the necessary LARC/CAC training materials and facilities for practical skill training and tools for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Upon completion of the TOT, instructors were assigned to review the existing curriculums for training of midwifery and clinical nursing students, identify gaps and come up with recommendations on how to fill these gaps. Once they identified the gaps, the TOT  trained instructors were asked to amend the curriculum to ensure adequate time for theoretical and practical aspects of the trainings. Ipas provided financial support and technical guidance, and the universities revised the curriculums and the corresponding course syllabi.  They also developed a tracking book and checklist to ensure that each student receives adequate skill practice and their skills are evaluated systematically by their instructors. We provided essential kits, simulators and instruments to strengthen the skill labs for simulated skill practice and prepared 24 public health facilities for skill practice</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Both midwifery and clinical nursing departments of the three universities used the revised curriculum as their official curriculum and the strengthened skill labs and health facilities to teach their students in an ongoing manner. Instructors who received TOT lead the LARC and CAC teaching activities and also trained other peer instructors on these skills. Students successfully utilized the skill labs for simulated skill practice and public health facilities that were prepared to provide LARC/CAC services and serve as  skill practice sites on real clients. Instructors used the teaching materials and tracking and evaluating tools for recording and evaluating student’s skill and competency evaluation. During October 2016 and June 2017, a total of 621 ( 336 midwife and 285 clinical nursing) students completed these learning processes and were found to be competent to provide both LARC and CAC services. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Midlevel services providers, such as midwives and clinical nurses, are the frontline health workers women normally encounter when they face reproductive health problems such as family planning and abortion care issues. However, in Ethiopia these health professionals do not acquire the knowledge and skills in preservice training to provide these essential and life-saving services. In- -service training is not sustainable because it is very expensive and difficult to reach all professionals in these groups. Including LARC and CAC in the routine teaching and learning process of preservice institutions and supporting them to own and implement it in their regular teaching learning process will expand the provider pool, enable women to have access to the services and mitigate the stigma associated with these services among service providers and community members. Moreover, it is cost effective and could easily be integrated in the routine teaching learning processes.</p>",

      "title": "Provision of injectable contraceptives (DMPA) by community health workers in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review of safety, acceptability and effectiveness.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Solid evidence exists showing that if women who expressed their desire to limit or space births had access to family planning methods, 54 million unintended pregnancies, more than 79,000 maternal deaths and more than a million infant deaths, could be prevented each year. Yet more than 200 million women in the developing world wishing to avoid pregnancy do not have access to modern methods of contraception. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) tops the chart of the regions with the highest unmet need for family planning, with approximately 60% having unmet needs.</p><p>In SSA, injectable contraceptives are the most popular contraceptives methods but, their provision has greatly been limited in clinical settings despite the appalling shortages of health care providers and relatively poor access to health facilities especially in rural areas. Community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives has been endorsed by WHO and other partner organisations like USAID as a promising option in improving access to family planning services as well as expanding the method mix to women desiring to limit births. A few countries in SSA have responded positively towards this initiative by putting in place policies in favour of the use of community health workers (CHWs) in the delivery of injectable contraceptives.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main aim of this review was to identify, critically appraise and synthesize evidence supporting the use of community-based administration of injectable contraceptives in SSA. More specifically, we sought to assess: 1) the ability of CHWs to provide injectable contraceptives to clients safely; 2) the acceptability of community-based delivery of injectable contraceptives by clients and; 3) the effectiveness of the community-based provision of injectable contraceptives.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A protocol which is in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis protocols) guidelines was developed to guide the systematic review process. Nine international electronic databases and the websites of organisations known to support community-based reproductive health initiatives in SSA were searched systemically for studies. Experts in this area were also contacted for the identification of unpublished literature and ongoing studies.</p><p>All studies that evaluated the performance of CHWs in administering injectable contraceptives to women of childbearing age (15-49 years) irrespective of study design were considered. Studies that compared provision of injectable contraceptives by CHWs to provision in clinical settings by trained healthcare staff were eligible; however, non-comparative reports of CHW usage were eligible for consideration.</p><p>Reference lists of eligible studies were also checked for studies. Eligible studies underwent quality and risk of bias assessment using the Effective Public Practice Project tool.</p><p>Safety, acceptability and effectiveness of CHWs provision of DMPA were assessed using the following outcomes: Injection site morbidity for safety, client satisfaction and continuation rates for acceptability and the uptake of DMPA services for effectiveness. A customized data extraction form was used to extract data and analysis was done through a narrative synthesis.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The search strategy identified a total of 1358 studies with 8 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. 1 unpublished study was provided by an expert making a total of 9 studies meeting the inclusion criteria.</p><p>Injection site morbidity as reported by supervisors and DMPA clients were satisfactorily low in all studies. The highest rates were seen in Madagascar, 3% of clients. In Uganda, equivalent rates were seen for two studies that compared CHW services to clinic-based services, less than 1%.</p><p>High levels of continuation rates at 3 months were seen for CHWs clients who had received a first injection of DMPA across all studies, ranging from 68.1% in Mozambique to 96% in Madagascar. Nine-month continuation rates of CHW clients was 68% in Kenya and 84% in Uganda. In comparison studies, significant differences were seen in favour of CHWs at both 3 months (83.7% versus 81.6%) and 6 months (78.8% versus 62.3%).</p><p>High levels (at least 70%) of client satisfaction with CHW as a provider as well as DMPA as a contraceptive method were observed.</p><p>CHW provision of injectable contraceptives to communities exposed many women to family planning services. The proportion of new family planning users served by CHWs ranged from 14% in Kenya to 66% in Mozambique. Significant differences were seen between CHW and clinic-based services in reaching out to new DMPA clients, 86% versus 76% respectively in Uganda and 58.4% versus 45.9% respectively in Ethiopia. Twenty-one percent of women in Senegal switched from receiving DMPA in clinics to CHWs.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p><strong>Research:</strong> Before the introduction of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives, prior qualitative research should be carried out to determine community perception to family planning. More research (systematic reviews) should be directed towards finding cost-effective means of expanding access to injectable contraceptives by using CHWs as a whole. Such research could take into consideration CHWs remunerations as well as other logistical issues.</p><p><strong>Policy:</strong> In this review, most of the studies carried out were generally of poor quality and none of them was randomized. Despite the fact that Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard study designs required to determine the effectiveness of public health interventions, strict reliance on them severely limits the existing evidence used to inform investments in developmental initiatives such as expanding access to family planning services. Therefore, effective decision making should balance the type of evidence needed with the policy question at hand. In the light of this appraisal, the benefits of CHWs provision of injectable contraceptives clearly outweighs any potential harm that may arise. Therefore, policymakers of SSA countries that have not yet endorse this initiative are advised to give it due consideration.</p><p><strong>Practice</strong>: Even though the current evidence is lacking, health planners could consider using CHWs in family planning service delivery strategies within communities. Especially as their services are generally not costly. However, they have to bear in mind that, maintaining quality standards and best practices rely on the Physicians and Nurses who serve as supervisors to CHWs. </p>",

      "title": "Safety, Quality and Acceptability of Task sharing Contraceptive Implants to Community Health Extension Workers: A Non-inferiority Quasi-experimental Study in Kaduna and Ondo States, Nigeria. ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>While contraceptive prevalence has increased in Nigeria in recent years, only 16% of married women of reproductive age use a modern method, and only 4.7% use long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) (IUDs and implants). The Federal Government is committed to scaling up access to modern contraceptives, including to underserved women in poor, remote areas. Until recently, nurses and midwives trained to provide LARCs were concentrated in urban centres and in Southern Nigeria. In order to scale-up access to LARCs, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) recognised the role that Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) could play, given that they provide services in remote locations and outnumber nurses by three to one. In 2014, the FMOH adopted a task-sharing policy allowing CHEWs to provide implants and IUDs. CHEWs receive three years medical training, thus somewhat equivalent to auxiliary nurses, a cadre that WHO currently recommends only insert implants with close monitoring and evaluation. We conducted a quasi-experimental cohort study to test whether CHEWs inserted implants to a level of safety, quality and acceptability that could deem them as ‘non-inferior’ to nurse/midwives. While other studies have investigated the feasibility of scaling-up LARCs to CHEWs, this is the first study to evaluate clinical outcomes.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In partnership with the Nigerian FMOH and the Kaduna and Ondo State Ministries of Health, MSI Nigeria (MSION) developed training and supervision materials to enable CHEWs to deliver implants in their own facilities. Facilities were supplied with Implanon or Jadelle implants. Twelve clinical supervisors trained 119 providers to insert and remove implants, manage adverse events, and provide counselling.  Following five successful supervised insertions of each implant brand, providers were accredited to insert implants unsupervised.  Providers received supervisory visits over the course of the study.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study took place in 2015 and 2016 in 93 public sector clinics. 119 providers participated: 30 nurses/midwives and 30 CHEWs from Ondo, and 29 nurses/midwives and 30 CHEWs from Kaduna.  None had previous experience with implant provision. Women aged 18-49 choosing an implant were enrolled into the study by their provider, who had been trained on research protocols. 4,107 nurse/midwife clients and 3,584 CHEW clients contributed data on adverse events (AEs) occurring on day of insertion.  Of these, 6,504 (3,517 nurse/midwife clients and 2,987 CHEW clients) were followed up two weeks later (a 15% loss to follow-up) Moderate and severe AEs at insertion and follow-up were recorded by providers using structured questionnaires.  Also, clinical supervisors observed 1,420 implant insertions (883 nurse/midwives and 537 CHEWs) to assess provision quality, using a 28 item checklist; and 383 nurse/midwife clients and 366 CHEW clients participated in exit interviews to assess satisfaction.  Data were analysed with a multivariate analysis using a Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) model, using Wald tests to assess goodness of fit. Non-inferiority margins were 0.5% for Insertion AEs, 1% for Day 14 events, and 10% for quality. AE margins were converted to odds ratios due to binary and rare outcomes.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>By Day 14, 4.3% women had experienced a moderate or severe AE (bruising/haematoma, bleeding around insertion site, implant breakage, unsuccessful insertion, pain around insertion site, post-insertion bleeding, infection, paraesthesia, scarring, expulsion). The most common AE was implant expulsion (3.2%), which differed by provider. Overall, 6.9% of CHEW clients and 2.1% of nurses/midwife clients experienced a moderate or severe AE by Day 14.  After adjusting for clustering by provider, previous insertion experience and presence of an additional provider at the facility, we found a significant difference in the proportion of clients with moderate or severe AEs between CHEWs and nurses/midwives (aOR=2.42 (95% 1.25 – 4.70).  The adjusted 95% upper bound exceeds the non-inferiority margin of 2.02 so we do not conclude that CHEWs are non-inferior to nurses/midwives.</p><p>Overall, 70% of providers scored 28/28 during quality assessments (‘good quality’) (67% CHEWs and 73% nurse/midwives). After adjusting for state and previous insertion experience, the proportion of good quality insertions for CHEWs was 4.8% lower than for nurses/midwives with 95% CI -15.1% to 5.6%. The 95% lower confidence limit is below the non-inferiority margin of -10% so we cannot conclude that insertion quality for CHEWs was non-inferior to nurses/midwives.</p><p>Clients of nurses/midwives were more highly satisfied than those of CHEWs (64.7% vs 56.7%).  After adjusting for state, other provider at facility and urban/rural location, the proportion of ‘satisfied clients’ among CHEWs is 4.3 percentage points lower than among nurses/midwives. We did not assess non-inferiority for satisfaction.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>From our analysis we could not conclude that CHEWs were non-inferior to nurses. Further investigation demonstrated that higher AE rates were driven by a small number of poor-performing providers. Findings imply that CHEWs require ongoing support and monitoring post-training to ensure safety and quality, as do nurses and midwives. Given that expulsions were a particular problem in this study, providers may require more practice before accreditation, and clients should be adequately counselled to avoid strenuous physical activity following insertion. Programmes supervising CHEWs should include post-insertion monitoring to ensure safety, quality and contraceptive coverage. MSION found that expulsion rates were reduced following greater attention to supervision This was a large study evaluating multiple outcomes implemented in real-life contexts of provider clinics, but consequently the reliability of findings should also be interpreted with some caution – all AE’s were recorded by providers themselves, which was subject to bias from differential reporting in the two cadres. MSION is now supporting State and Federal Ministries of Health in scale-up of CHEW and nurse/midwife training, supervision and accreditation, learning the lessons from this experience and study in order to avail this highly effective method to women in remote and rural areas.  </p>",

      "title": "Strengthening the evidence of lay health worker provision of injectable contraception: A randomized controlled trial in Pakistan",
      "significanceBackground": "<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Task sharing of health services by higher and lower level cadres of providers has been adopted as a pragmatic response to human resource shortages in many developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) supports the administration of injectable contraceptives by lay health workers with targeted monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). The evidence supporting lay health worker provision of injectable contraception, while strong and bolstered by many pilot studies and programs worldwide, does not include a randomized controlled trial (RCT). An RCT constitutes the highest level of evidence in the WHO research framework; thus, a trial demonstrating that lay health workers can just as safely and effectively initiate injectable contraception as clinically-trained cadres of health providers could modify the recommendation of targeted M&amp;E for intramuscular injections (DMPA IM)--and with the advent of Sayana® Press —subcutaneous (SC) injections as well. Modifications in WHO task sharing recommendations could reduce program costs, the need for supervision and targeted M&amp;E and further increase women’s access to injectable contraception worldwide. Locating the RCT in Pakistan where there is a large and well-organized lay health worker cadre would have a huge positive impact on FP access and the country’s contraceptive prevalence rate.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p><strong>Main question</strong>: The key objective of the RCT was to assess whether the lay health worker cadre, Lady Health Workers (LHWs) in Sindh Province, Pakistan can screen and initiate women on DMPA IM and SC injections as safely and effectively as their clinically-trained counterparts, Lady Health Visitors (LHVs). Although LHWs were already allowed to provide follow-up doses and a recent policy change in Sindh now allows them to initiate injectable use, the question of whether LHWs can perform just as well as the more experienced LHVs remains, which has implications for the scale-up of this practice in other Pakistani provinces.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: We conducted an RCT in Sindh Province, Pakistan, randomizing new DMPA IM acceptors to receive services either from an LHW or an LHV as well as randomizing them to receive DMPA IM or SC from these providers. Therefore, two independent randomization events were conducted for each DMPA acceptor. Data collectors were trained to conduct observations of screening and counseling of first-time DMPA clients performed by the LHWs and LHVs affiliated with five health facilities in Karachi and five in Thatta districts. Nurses at each of these 10 facilities--blinded to whom (LHW or LHV) provided the initial screening-- verified client eligibility to use DMPA through their own client interview. If the nurse verified client eligibility, the same LHW or LHV who earlier screened and counseled her then administered the randomly-selected DMPA IM or SC injection. With 90% power and 5% significance level to test the non-inferiority hypothesis that LHWs can screen potential DMPA clients for method initiation just as adequately as LHVs, we recruited a sample of approximately 400 new DMPA clients from the 10 health facilities. The trial, as well as interviews with all participating LHWs and LHVs, took place from March to July 2018.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Results/key findings</strong>: Preliminary findings suggest that LHWs are just as competent at screening and counseling first-time DMPA users as their clinically-trained counterparts, LHVs. The RCT provided independent, third-party observations of DMPA IM and SC counseling and administration by LHVs and LHWs--an element not included in the design of previous task sharing studies that compared the lay worker cadre with a clinically-trained provider. By randomizing the provision of DMPA formulations, client and provider attitudes towards the new form of DMPA were assessed in a balanced manner. Client satisfaction with both modes of injectable administration were documented as well as provider perspectives on use and management of DMPA SC vis à vis DMPA IM under similar conditions.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p><strong>Knowledge contribution</strong>: With a finding from an RCT that lay health workers are able to provide injectable contraception as safely and effectively as clinically-trained providers, the need for context-specific pilot studies may wane. Moreover, by bolstering the findings of previous operational and pilot studies of community-based provision of injectables, this trial would also provide the impetus to reassess WHO’s recommendation for targeted M&amp;E of community-based injection. Specific to Pakistan, the Government of Sindh can proceed confidently with the new policy allowing LHWs to initiate clients on DMPA, while other provinces in the country can follow suit in training their LHWs to initiate DMPA use. Indeed, allowing the 100,000+ LHWs to initiate contraceptive injectables would greatly expand access to family planning in Pakistan, since LHWs work mostly in rural areas where 80% of the population is located. The additional information on attitudes toward DMPA SC, along with the new comparable price of 85 cents per Sayana® Press unit (comparable to DMPA IM), can inform the government of Pakistan on the practicality of registering and procuring the product in the public sector.</p>",

      "title": "Task-Sharing through Blended Learning Strategy to Increase Access to Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives and Postabortion Care in Conflict Settings",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Currently, over 65 million people are displaced due to armed conflict. As the complexity and magnitude of displacement due conflict increase, it is proving difficult to reach girls and women with comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services. Fragile health systems, damage to health infrastructure, competing priorities, and lack of skilled health care provider are some of the challenges faced by organizations. The unmet needs for SRH, and especially contraception has been documented by earlier studies. New ways of delivering SRH information and services, and innovations are imperative to address the unmet needs for SRH and contraceptives. </p><p> </p><p>To address this challenge, Save the Children, designed a blended learning strategy, an individualized training approach tailored to address the knowledge and skill gaps of the provider. The capacity building approach has four training components: self-learning workbook, e - learning, competency based training, and supportive supervision &amp; mentorship. Individual competency was determined on a tablet-based knowledge and skills assessment tool. Four levels of competencies: beginner, medium, advanced, and expert trainer were defined based on knowledge test score and skills assessment checklist. The training provided and the frequency of supervision was tailored to competency level and gaps identified.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Task-shifting/task-sharing to middle-level providers (nurses, midwifes) can have a critical role in improving coverage and access to SRH. This specific evaluation focused on provision of long-acting and reversible contraceptives (LARC) and post-abortion care (PAC). We hypothesized that blended-learning strategy with four methods of teaching based on competency level of provider will enable mid-level providers achieve the highest competency within a short time frame as compared to traditional workshop based trainings that don’t take into account individual capacity needs. We employed tablet-based trainee follow-up system to enable supervisors to monitor individual provider and health facilities, analyzed findings, and deliver training. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We trained and followed 133 trainees in Somalia, DRC, and Pakistan. We defined a competency framework based on LARC and PAC knowledge and skills checklist. We then built a training database based on the competency framework where providers are assigned from  level 1 to level 4, based on knowledge test and skills assessment. </p><p> </p><p>The tablet-based trainee follow-up system is linked to an online database that generates analyzed data by individual provider and by health facility. We collect three types of data: a) competency based-training received: training topic, post training test scores, procedures performed during training, and skills assessment score based on predefined checklist, b) log-book of provider – that lists number of procedures performed by provider on LARC and PAC, c) trainee follow up assessment score (knowledge and skills assessment).</p><p> </p><p>Data was analyzed using the online database system with predefined indicators: baseline competency level; mean duration for competency improvement from one level to next; correlation of competency level with service provided to clients; and frequency/dose of supervision/training needed to achieve level 3 and level 4 competency. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The baseline assessment of 47 facilities found that fewer than 25% had a provider who could offer at least one LARC method (Implant or Intra-Uterine Contraceptive Device). Post-intervention, all 47 facilities were clinically able to offer LARCs. Among the 131 mid-level providers, the percentage with acceptable LARC performance (at least 85% of observation checklist and knowledge test score correct) changed significantly over the intervention period. At baseline, 10% of the health facilities provided postabortion care with manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) and only medical doctors were clinically able to perform dilation and curettage (D&amp;C). Post-intervention majority of mid-level providers offered MVA for PAC with performance score level ranging from medium to advanced level. </p><p> </p><p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from 2016 to 2017, the number of clients receiving modern contraceptive methods increased by 58% (from 9778 in 2016 to 15454 in 2017). The percent change of clients seeking and receiving LARC was 81% (from 5508 to 9778). In Somalia from 2016 to 2017, the number of clients seeking and receiving modern contraceptive increased by 25% (from 6301 in 2016 to 7877 in 2017) and  percentage of clients seeking and receiving LARC increased by 22% (from 1522 in 2016 to 1855 in 2017). In Pakistan where there is a higher number of women medical doctors and lady health visitors, training lady health visitors on LARC was not associated with increase in LARC uptake from 2016 to 2017. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Success of the blended learning strategy to improve access to information and services for contraceptives and post-abortion care at the lowest health care level near to the community was in part attributable to tailored training approach that addressed the competency gaps of the provider. Task-sharing requires that each provider has the knowledge, the skills, and the enabling environment for continued learning. Mid-level health care workers are not always at the same level of competency and individual pathways to learn are critical to ensure that scale is achieved at quality. The blended learning approach has the potential to transition to scale in other similar contexts, where there is shortage of skilled health workers. The tablet-based trainee follow-up system, with e-learning modules, teaching aides, and online database system that generated analyzed data regularly could be a way to empower clinical supervisors and SRH managers to better prioritize and tailor resources. </p>",

      "title": "Comparative Study in Contraceptive Method Mix in Asian Countries  with high and low fertility ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In all the developing countries, state sponsored family planning programmes primarily tried to increase the prevalence of contraceptive across the populace, but their instruments to do this remained starkly different. If state sponsored family planning programme is one side of the story, individual preferences most definitely comprise the other end of the spectrum. With the gradual invention and medicalization of a wide variety of contraceptive methods, a couple’s choice becomes one of the primary academic query, as all methods have their own pros and cons including user convenience to effectiveness and medical side effects. After the Cairo conference of International Conference on Population and Development, acceptance of cafeteria approach by the international community, that is ensuring a couple has realistic access to all the methods before choosing one, has brought further limelight to the issue of method mix.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Broadly, the paper aims at looking into the history of family planning for each of the countries and how the government or state intervenes to shape the contraceptive method mix in its region. Specifically, the study tries to address the following objectives. To analyze whether there is any significant variations existing in the type of contraceptives used in both high and low fertility Asian countries, To analyze the relationship between TFR and CPR in the set of selected countries; To analyze the differences in population policy across the selected countries and to see whether the captured variations in the pattern of contraceptive use can portray a contrasting picture of the two</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This paper presents an inter-country comparison of countries having high fertility and those which have already achieved replacement level fertility. The high fertility Asian countries dealt here are Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bhutan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Philippines, Timor Lesthe and Laos. These twelve countries have a TFR of above 3, coupled with an ascending population growth rate but still all of these countries have a low Couple Protection Rate. The contraceptive behaviour of this set of countries is compared with the low fertility countries. These are Japan, South Korea, North Korea, China, Hong Kong, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iran, Vietnam and Thailand. Dominant and distinctive methods are used to explain the contraceptive pattern from the Demographic and Health Survey data and policy review is done to explain the captured variation in the method mix.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>There are wide variations in timing of initiation of family planning programmes in Asia; some began with pro-natalist policies though having high TFR for providing more military power to the nation and some follow strict anti-natalist measures. The government played a very important role in shaping the dominance of a particular contraceptive. In some high fertility countries family planning programs started much later, and the governments being riddled with underdevelopment, instability and religious fundamentalism is willing to and able to devote much less resources in the family planning programs in spite of acknowledging unchecked population growth is a concern (apart from certain phases of pro natalist policies). In contrast to this, the low fertility countries have successful population control movements where in some cases; it has gone so low that state has to interfere to motivate couples for procreation. In West Asian countries of Syria and Jordan and even in case of Pakistan where women want to use contraceptives, but are not free to use it due to unavailability or social cost associated with it. These are the people who end up using traditional methods like rhythm and withdrawal. For these people use of traditional method is not as much an informed choice, rather a residual process to depend on. The case is quite different in Philippines, where government actively pursued an agenda to promote rhythm method in collaboration with the church. This led to a number of people using traditional methods, but eventually the focus shifted to efficient modern contraceptives.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Much has been researched on issues related to family planning, birth control, contraception, fertility and related topics. Factors affecting contraceptive use have also been exhausted upon; but this paper adds a different layer of icing as to how state shapes the contraceptive use of a country and mould couple’s choice in contraception. This also captures the difference in the high fertility countries in contrast to the low fertility Asian countries. The trajectory of an inter-country comparative study has been depicted here; stressing on the method mix with a tint of family planning history. This paper is focused on the historical context of government family planning and population policies and how it shapes the method mix in contraception across the selected Asian countries. Thus, the entire set of analysis of the already existing pattern is tried to look through the coloured lens of ‘government policies’ and ‘governmentality’. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Meta-analyses of observational studies raise concerns about a possible link between the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and increased risk of HIV acquisition.  In 2017, based on accumulating data, the World Health Organization changed the Medical Eligibility Criteria for injectable contraceptives among women at high risk of HIV from a category 1 (no restriction on use) to a category 2 (advantages of use generally outweigh risks).  The Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) Study, a randomized clinical trial comparing the risks of DMPA, levonorgestrel implants, and copper IUD use on HIV acquisition is underway with results expected in 2019. </p><p></p><p>The question of a potential link between DMPA use and HIV acquisition is critical for sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV is epidemic and where the contraceptive method mix is skewed towards injectables in many countries. If the ECHO trial finds that use of DMPA, but not levonorgestrel implants or copper IUDs, is associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition, countries may restrict provision of injectables. Understanding the implications such possible restrictions may have on contraceptive use, the contraceptive method mix, and key maternal and child health (MCH) and HIV indicators is integral to program planning. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>To better understand the public health implications of restrictions on injectables, we conducted an exploratory modeling exercise to assess the impact of complete or partial removal of injectables from the contraceptive method mix in sub-Saharan Africa. We chose 22 countries with either high HIV prevalence and high DMPA use, or that were USAID priority countries.  Our outcomes included yearly change in MCH and HIV indicators such as: unintended pregnancies, live births, abortions, maternal deaths, HIV infections in women of reproductive age (WRA), HIV infections in children, and MCH health care costs.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We developed an interactive deterministic model that predicts yearly changes in key MCH and HIV indicators when injectable contraceptives are partially or completely removed from the method mix and users are redistributed to remaining country-specific method mixes in 22 countries. Women are assumed to have the annual probability of pregnancy of the method they are redistributed to, contraceptive prevalence data are from the most recent national survey, HIV incidence, prevalence, ART, and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) data are from AIDSInfo, and all injectables are grouped together.  Impact2 Calculator and Adding It Up publication were used to quantify impact on MCH indicators. A second tier of modifiable inputs allows for more refined projections based on changes in method-specific yearly probability of pregnancy, MTCT probabilities, condom effectiveness against HIV, and HIV incidence rate among WRA.</p><p></p><p>The model allows adjustment of key inputs and shows impact via graphs of key indicators.  Modifiable inputs include: relative risk (RR) for HIV infection with injectables, percentage of injectable users who stop the method, percentage of users reallocated to remaining method mix, and country (individual country or all). Projected changes to the method mix, including estimated numbers of new users of each remaining method, are displayed in tables.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The model outputs are dependent on user inputs.  In an extreme scenario where RR for HIV acquisition from DMPA use is 1.40, 100% of injectables are discontinued, and no injectable users are reallocated to the method mix, the model predicts approximately: 51,000 fewer HIV+ women and an additional 6.8 million additional unintended pregnancies per year, 3.6 million additional live births, 2.2 million abortions, 30,000 HIV+ infants, and 22,000 maternal deaths per year for all 22 countries. In contrast, if all injectable users are reallocated to their existing country-specific method mix, the model predicts: 83,000 fewer HIV+ women and an additional 350,000 unintended pregnancies, 170,000 live births, 133,000 abortions, 2,500 HIV+ infants, and 500 maternal deaths. </p><p></p><p>In countries with high long-acting and reversible contraception (LARC) use, such as Ethiopia where LARCs comprise a quarter of the method mix, the model shows improvement in both MCH and HIV indicators if all users are reallocated to the method mix as users are moved from injectables to more effective methods such as implants and IUDs.  However, in countries with high short-acting method use, such as Zimbabwe where two thirds of the method mix is comprised of pills and condoms, the model shows improvements in HIV acquisition among women but negative outcomes in all other indicators.</p><p></p><p>These extreme injectable redistribution scenarios are not realistically achievable and likely the response to any ECHO results showing a RR higher than 1.0 would be somewhere in the middle.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Because injectables are such a popular method of contraception especially in sub-Saharan African countries with a high HIV prevalence, understanding the public health implications of the potential removal of injectables from the contraceptive method mix is of critical importance. </p><p></p><p>In all more plausible injectable redistribution scenarios, the predicted population-level benefits on HIV incidence gained by removing injectables from the contraceptive method mix would be outweighed by negative public health impacts, including increases in unintended pregnancies, abortions, maternal deaths, child deaths, and HIV infections in children  However, the outcome of redistribution scenarios is highly dependent on the contraceptive method mix, with positive outcomes expected when LARC use is high. </p><p></p><p>Thus, increasing the availability of and access to LARCs could help mitigate the public health impact of the removal of injectables if DMPA is found to be associated with HIV acquisition.  However, changing the contraceptive method mix is not a simple task.  Providing increased access to LARCs, while ensuring informed choice, has significant programmatic, financial, and logistical challenges.  This model serves as a planning tool which allows policy makers and program planners to input realistic scenarios for their country and use the results to help make informed decisions regarding programming and procurement.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family Planning is one of the cost-effective ways to prevent maternal, infant and child mortality. Zambia has a low modern contraceptive prevalence rate (45%) with a  predominant use of short term methods resulting in suboptimal health impact on maternal and women’s health. Injectables are the most preferred method among married women (19.3%), followed by the oral pill (11.8%), implants (5.5%), male condom (4%) and IUCD (1.2%). Zambia's  the unmet need for FP is 21%[1]. In 2012, the Government of Zambia committed to increasing contraceptive prevalence rate from 33% to 58% during the FP 2020 London summit. In line the government’s efforts, Society for Family Health (SFH) is implementing the Sexual and Reproductive Health for All Initiative (SARAI) a 5 year USAID funded project (2015 - 2020. SARAI supports 88 of 303 government facilities in 15 districts across Copperbelt, Muchinga and Luapula Provinces. The aim of the Project is to increase modern contraceptive rate by 2% annually in supported districts through increased access to, and improved quality of integrated family planning and reproductive health services at both facility and community levels.</p> <p>[1] Zambia Demographic and Health Survey 2013 - 14</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) service provision is limited in Zambia with 34% of facilities requesting implants and 4% requesting IUDs from central stores [2].To support the expansion of LARC services, SARAI uses dedicated and off-duty provider models to increase trained FP providers providing quality services. One dedicated FP provider is seconded to each province, while off-duty providers are engaged during their off-duty hours at selected high-volume public sector facilities. To support these models. In addition, SARAI trained 598 Community Based Distributors (CBDs) to generate demand for LARCs in the communities.</p> <p>[2] Republic of Zambia: Integrated Family Planning Scale-Up Plan 2013 - 2020</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Dedicated providers are midwives who are trained to mentor FP providers in provision of services including supply chain and logistics according to minimum standards of care to ensure sustained high quality services. Dedicated providers also conduct mentorship and supervision of all trained providers. Off-duty providers were engaged to improve access to FP services through increasing the number hours and days for FP service provision. This is in addition to regular FP services provided at facility level. The Off-duty providers generate demand for FP services and offer group counselling as women wait to receive other services. In addition they create demand and counsel for postpartum FP methods to women who have just delivered. FP methods are also discussed during (ANC) visits. SARAI used Ministry of Health (MoH), Health Management Information System (HMIS) data to measure project performance. Data for FP-related visits for the period October 2016 to September 2017 from 303 facilities of which 88 received direct support from the project was reviewed. This data represents 15 districts in Copperbelt, Muchinga and Luapula provinces. Data collected included the type of modern method used and information on new clients and returning clients from SARAI-supported and non-SARAI-supported facilities to monitor program changes in method mix and contraceptive use.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Total catchment population Women of Reproductive Age (WRA) for 303 facilities is 731,054. SARAI supported facilities account for 29% of the total facilities from 15 implementing districts which accounts for a catchment population of 300,404 women in WRA representing 41% of total WRA population. Between October 2016 to September 2017, HMIS data showed 604,185 FP-related visits across all facilities in the 15 implementing districts, of which 111,933 where new visits.  Over half (53%), of the new visits took place in SARAI-supported facilities. Project interventions were associated with increases in provision of LARC methods; 65% and 48% of all IUD and implants insertions in the implementing districts, respectively, were from health facilities supported by SARAI. The uptake of Implants and IUDs in SARAI-supported facilities also increased accounting for 9.1% and 1.4% compared to 7.1% and 0.3% in non-SARAI-supported facilities. Across the implementing districts, 328,768 couple years of protection (CYPs) were provided, of which 46% came from SARAI-supported facilities. Finally, 512,487 people were reached with FP messages through community activities such as FP counselling and child immunization outreach.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>A combination of sustained monitoring and supervision of FP providers, increase in access to FP services including LARCs by increasing the number of hours and days during which FP is provided as well as increased demand generation at community level can increase uptake of LARC amongst WRA in a given catchment population.  SARAI has demonstrated that use of CBDs to generate demand for FP methods and refer clients for LARC to public FP providers can result in an improved uptake of LARCs. Increasing uptake of LARCs is possible when concerted effort from all key players, government, FP providers, CBDs and other implementing partners in FP programming is enhanced. In addition, capacity building in supply chain management for FP commodity is important for sustained and uninterrupted FP service provision.  A focus on strengthening human resources and strong supervision mechanisms embedded in existing public health systems are also key to improving LARC uptake. Demand generation at all levels of the health system including communities can not be over emphasized. Demand generation efforts need to be coordinated and evidence based for optimal impact. SARAI has demonstrated that it is feasible to shift the FP needle towards more effective contraceptive methods in a public sector setting while leveraging existing MoH systems.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Marie Stopes International (MSI) is committed to ensuring a full range of family planning (FP) methods are on offer to all women. We monitor the uptake of different method types, the 'FP method mix’, to understand the choices made by our clients. Monitoring of Marie Stopes Burkina Faso (MSBF) routine service data highlighted differences in the proportion of clients choosing long acting and reversible contraception (LARC) across its service delivery teams. 2017 Track20 FP2020 data suggest that nationally 39.8% of women using modern methods have opted for an implant. In order to ensure that MSBF is best serving its clients we felt it was important to understand the differences in the FP method mix delivered by the MSBF teams. Several possible explanations were suggested, potential provider bias, client bias, cultural factors, method availability and rumours. In the first instance, MSBF turned to its routine data sources to help understand its FP method mix trends in more depth, and help pinpoint (or rule out) some of the potential explanations for any differences.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aimed to identify trends in the FP method mix delivered by MS BF’s five centres and nine outreach teams in order to reveal insights into some of the potential reasons for variations. Specific research questions included:</p><ul>\t<li>How does method mix vary by service delivery team?</li>\t<li>What is the profile of clients choosing implants?</li>\t<li>What proportion of clients had a method in mind prior to their visit and what proportion received this method?</li>\t<li>Do counselling scores vary among clients choosing different methods?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The analysis triangulated data from two routine sources:</p>\t<li>2017 routine client service data for the five centres and nine outreach teams. Data for these 15 sites was collected using Client Information Centre (CLIC), an electronic client register and information management system. CLIC collects and stores information on each client visit. This includes client demographic characteristics, previous contraceptive use and services received during the visit.  For the 12 months of 2017 available data includes almost 50,000 client visits. CLIC was only introduced in some outreach teams part way through 2017, so the dataset does not reflect a whole year of service delivery for all teams.</li>\t<li>Client exit interviews (CEIs). Annual client exit interviews explore measures of client experience, including satisfaction with different elements of service delivery and counselling quality, as well as the socio-demographic profile of clients. The most recent interviews (conducted in November 2017) include a total sample 574 FP clients (from across all service delivery channels).</li>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Implants were the main FP service provided in 39% of FP client visits recorded in CLIC during 2017. Implants were provided in a far higher proportion of FP visits to MSBF outreach teams (55%) compared to MSBF centres (21%).</p><p>Among the five centres and nine outreach teams there were also considerable variations in the proportion of FP client visits where implants were provided. This varied from 8% to 28% across the five centres and from 48% to 63% among the nine outreach teams. </p><p>A greater proportion of implant client visits were with adolescent girls ages 15-19 (19%), compared to the proportion of all client visits with adolescent girls (12%). The age profile of implant client visits also varied considerably by service delivery team. We also found that in 87% of implant client visits the woman was not using contraception at the time of her visit (FP adopter); 49% were first time users of contraception (compared to 58% for FP adopters and 30% for first time users across all visits).</p><p>CEI data suggests that 70% of centres clients had a method in mind at the time of their visit and 92% received their desired method. In outreach, 67% had a method in mind and 69% received it. Both service delivery channels scored well on the FP2020 method index, which evaluates the quality of counselling provided, and there were no significant differences between the scores reported by implant and non-implant clients.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>MSI is committed to ensuring that women are able to make an informed and voluntary choice regarding their FP use. We do this by making sure that women of all ages can access the full range of FP methods and that they are provided with comprehensive counselling to help inform their decision. Our analysis suggests that outreach teams have been able to increase access to implants for Burkinabé women, particularly for adolescents aged 15-19. CEI data indicates that the majority of clients arrived at their visit with an FP method in mind and that in centres, after comprehensive counselling, the majority of women went on to receive this method. Knowing that they would be able to access this particular service may have played a key role in their decision to visit. That almost a third of outreach clients who arrived with a method in mind chose to opt for an alternative method, suggesting that counselling was able to play a greater role for outreach clients fully informing them of their method choices.  Understanding what brings clients to MSBF services, and what FP method knowledge and preferences they arrive with, might help inform more targeted behaviour change strategies to further expand FP access. Additional analysis to explore in more depth the differences and specific learning by service delivery team is underway.</p>",

Permanent methods of FP (PM) contribute to the contraceptive prevalence rate at 1.2% for Tubal Ligation (TL).  The provision of PMs and especially TL is still a challenge, because the majority of the population in need lives in remote areas and travelling to hospitals can be difficult. Bringing services to the beneficiaries has been shown to increase uptake of FP in general in other countries (mobile outreach high impact practice brief) but also the increase access to PMs, especially TL. To be able to do so it requires investment by building the capacity of health providers as well as the availability of services and equipment.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>MCSP in collaboration with the Rwanda Ministry of Health has trained health providers, provided instrument kits, and initiated an outreach approach for permanent methods. This approach involves three levels. First, Community Health Workers inform the population about FP. Couples who want to space or limit births are referred to the health center, where counselling is provided on all FP methods. Health center staff notify hospitals of clients seeking TL using newly-established channels of communication between district hospitals and health centers. Hospitals plan days to offer PM services at health centers with waiting clients.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Data was gathered from district hospital and health center registers on the number of clients who underwent TL. Additionally, during mentorship health providers provided testimonies regarding the skills gained and how confident they are performing this procedure. To ensure data quality, triangulation was also done using HMIS, registers and consent form. At the health center level, there was a register where counseled couples were registered before the TL; this number was also sent to the hospital’s FP focal person to plan an outreach session and inform a trained medical doctor. After the intervention, each client’s file was kept at the health center. No formal qualitative research was done, but we documented quotes from providers during mentorship.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The training improved the skills of health providers so that they were able to provide strong counseling and successfully perform TL procedures. One provider said during a mentorship visit, ““Before implementing the outreach strategy, I did not talk about permanent methods during counselling, but now I am confident because clients in need receive services.”.”</p><p>Within a period of 24 months, 45 health care providers from 12 hospitals were trained on TL in 10 districts: 23 medical doctors, 11 nurses and 11 anesthetists. Skilled teams contributed to the increased accessibility of TL. According to HMIS data, 752 clients received a TL in the 10 supported districts. Of these, 56.2% received services at health centers and 53.8% in hospitals. This is a substantial improvement from the two previous years, during which only 457 clients had undergone TL in this catchment area, demonstrating a 64.6% increase between the two time periods.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The accessibility of PMs in general is still poor in remote communities located long distances from the nearest hospital.  Increasing the number of skilled health providers is one key strategy to overcome these barriers. As demonstrated by the HMIS data, bringing services closer to the remote communities by providing of TLs at health centers using the outreach approach combined with hospital service provision has contributed to increased uptake of TLs. During the implementation of the outreach on TL we have observed high acceptance on the clients, once the choice was done the appointment was respected; on the supply side there was always commodities and Health providers on the site chosen to provide the method. On additional to this the communication between health center and district hospital was efficiency, this has been realized through creation of group WhatsApp between health providers and the communication was easy and faster. Nevertheless, there is a need to sustain this program by integrating this activity in hospital work plan and make a regular supervision by District Health Management team for their ownership, otherwise it may disappear after NGOs left.    </p><p></p>",

      "title": "Evidence-Based Vasectomy Surgical Techniques: From Research to Practice",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Vasectomy is considered to be a simple, safe, very effective, and highly cost-effective contraceptive method. In recent years, however, research evidence has shown that the type of surgical technique can influence the effectiveness and the safety of the procedure. Decreasing pain during the procedure, reducing surgical complications, and optimizing contraceptive efficacy increase user satisfaction with the method and may lead to higher acceptability and increased uptake, especially in countries where it is underused.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>What is the scientific evidence on specific and distinct vasectomy surgical techniques to decrease pain during the procedure, to reduce surgical complications (bleeding and infections) post-procedure, and to maximize occlusion and contraceptive effectiveness? Are best practices integrated in selected vasectomy program from low-resource countries?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The available data on the safety and effectiveness of the three surgical steps of the vasectomy procedure (anesthesia, exposition, and occlusion of the vas deferens) were extracted from systematic literature reviews and recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American Urological Association (2012, 2015), the European Association of Urology (2012), the Faculty of Sexual &amp; Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) of United Kingdom (2104), and the Canadian Urological Association (2016). The strength of the evidence and level of the recommendations from the guidelines were compared to and put in the context of low-resource countries.  Evidence was contextualized with national standards and current practices in Mexico, Colombia, Haiti, Rwanda, Kenya, India, and Bangladesh.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Local anesthesia using a mini-needle (30 gauge needle) or a no-needle jet injector (Madajet®) minimizes pain during anesthesia (median pain level: 1/10) and surgery (median pain level: 0/10) – moderate quality evidence. The No-Scalpel technique (known as the No-Scalpel Vasectomy or NSV) reduces the risk of infections and bleeding – high-quality evidence based on randomized trials. The “classical” vas occlusion technique using ligatures on the vas deferens and excision of a small -1 cm- vas segment (L and E) is associated with a high risk of occlusion (8-13%) and contraceptive (3%-9%) failure - moderate quality evidence based on cohort studies. However, combining this technique with interposition of the fascia (FI) can reduce the risk of failure by 50% - high-quality evidence based on randomized trials. Combining cautery of the mucosa of the vas and FI is associated with the lower risk of occlusion failure (<p>Current national standards and practices in selected low-resources countries showed that anesthesia is mostly performed with medium (25) gauge needle. The NSV is largely adopted and performed to expose the vas.  Although some national standards recommend using FI, simple L and E is the mostly performed vas occlusion technique. Mucosal cautery is seldom used in selected countries. Modelling the cost per couple-years of protection (CYP) of FI, thermal cautery, and thermal cautery combined with FI in India, Kenya, and Mexico showed that these occlusion techniques would be more cost-effective than L and E.</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Research evidence has shown that more effective, safer, and adapted vasectomy surgical techniques are available, but are still underused in many countries. Creating and sustaining successful vasectomy programs in low-resources countries is challenging. Demand for vasectomy, access to services, and enabling environment must all be mutually reinforced.  Skillful vasectomy providers performing best practice surgical techniques is an essential component contributing to the success of vasectomy programs in countries where acceptance of vasectomy is low, follow-up of patients for complications is difficult, and access to post-vasectomy semen analysis to confirm success (or failure) of the procedure is not available.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Adolescents and adults with disabilities are as likely as persons without disabilities to be sexually active. Thus, they also have a need to learn about sexuality and the responsibilities that go along with exploring and experiencing one’s own sexuality. They have to know how to protect themselves against unintended pregnancies, HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, and sexual and gender-based violence. Privacy to experience their sexuality must also be considered for PwDs who live with support workers or with parents. Such information and services must be made available in accessible formats, including alternative communication formats to overcome the challenge of disability. Part and parcel of the larger population, WWDs living in Bahir Dar town are also experiencing difficulties in accessing family planning services. So this study will help in identifying the major factors that are hindering these people in utilizing FP services in their daily life. There was a limited study on this particular issue in the study area. So the potential contributions of the findings generated from this study will be important to understand the factors influencing the level of family planning services utilization by the study population. The study may give clue for further large scale</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>A report by UNFPA indicates that about 10 per cent of the world’s population, 650 million people live with a disability. Among these people, 80 per cent live in developing countries particularly in Africa, and their sexual and reproductive health has been neglected. According to similar report persons with disabilities are as likely as persons without disabilities to be sexually active and they are at increased risk of HIV/AIDS (1). These people are up to three times more likely to be victims of physical and sexual abuse and rape and have less access to family planning services. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>STUDY DESIGN: A cross sectional quantitative survey supplemented with qualitative study was conducted among women with disabilities in Bahir Dar town. STUDY AREA AND PERIOD The study was conducted from March to June 2014 among women with disabilities in Bahir Dar town who are members of associations of persons with disabilities. It was located in Bahir Dar town about 565 kms North West of Addis Ababa. Based on the 2007 Census conducted by CSA of Ethiopia, the population of Bahir Dar town is about 221,991(108,456 males and 113,535 females (16).   SOURCE POPULATION The source population is PwDs (N=1332) who are members of PwDs associations in Bahir Dar town. STUDY POPULATION The study population is WwDs namely: women having hearing, vision and physical problems, and who are in reproductive age (15-49 years) and members of PwDs associations (N=474), Bahir Dar town, North West Ethiopia. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION The sample size of the Study was calculated using formula for estimation of single proportion as: n= z2 ? /2 x p(1-p)   d2   n= (1.96)2 *(0.5) (0.5)   (0.05)2 n= 384, since the study population is less than 10,000; then, the correction factor to decrease sample size was used.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Result:A total of four hundred seventy four WWDs having hearing, vision and physical problems, and who are in reproductive age (15-49 years)  have participated in this study with 100% response rate. As far as forms of disability are concerned hearing problem, speaking problem,  total blindness, partial blindness, hand/arm problem, leg problem, arm and leg problem account for 63(13.3%), 24(5.1%), 102(21.5%), 72(15.2%), 46(9.7) 115(24.3%), and 52(11%) respectively.  467(98.3%) of WWDs faced obstacles in accessing FP services due to their disability situation. Among the obstacles physically accessing health facilities, the problem of inaccessibility of FP information formats like brail and language interpreter, poor handling of service providers feeling of social exclusion account for 417(88%),261(55.06%), 311(65.6%), 287(60.5%) respectively as mentioned by respondents. one hundred nineteen (40.1%) WWDs had at least one pregnancy in the past, and among those who had the experience of pregnancies, those who had only one pregnancy, two pregnancies, three pregnancies, account for 78(41.1%), 85(44.7%), 27(14.2%) respectively. Among those who ever had pregnancy  180 (94.7%) respondents gave birth, and out of them who had one child, and two children, were 165(91.7%) , 15(8.3%),respectively, and 165(86.8%) of the pregnancies were unintended. The findings of this study indicate that 52.7 percent did not use modern contraceptives due to disability situation and other problems.  Results from qualitative studies also show that the main challenge especially for those with vision and hearing difficulty was absence of formats like brail and language interpretations in health centers to get the nessasary FP information.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This study finding shows that the prevalence of Family Planning utilization was below fifty percent. It can be said that the majority of Women with Disabilities are at risk for problems like unintended pregnancy. Majority of the sexually experienced respondents’ first sexual encounter was unplanned often without any protection against pregnancy, or other potential reproductive health risks associated with unplanned sexual experiences.There was high rate of unintended pregnancy and high rate of abortion among ever pregnant WWDs. This is indicative of poor access to FP services to WWDs. High proportions of WWDs have heard about FP services, however, lower proportion of them had utilized FP services. Organizing sensitization session in the area where most WWDs benefit is beneficial. The focus of such sensitization and awareness program should be on equipping WWDs with self-esteem through provision of life -skills training thus improve their esteem and confidence for better RH outcomes. Moreover channel of information should be arranged to this specific population in order to address their specific needs according to the type of impairment. Information, education and communication (IEC) on FP for WWDs also need to be developed with special focus not only on the messages but also special focus on the various forms of disability. Therefore, it is recommended to design and implement specific interventions to promote Family Planning services among Women With Disabilities and respond to their sexual and reproductive health needs by making the necessary Family Planning information and service accessible.</p>",

      "title": "Safety of tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy provided by trained clinical officers versus assistant medical officers: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial in Tanzania",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Despite substantial increases in modern contraceptive use over the last 50 years, unmet need for family planning (FP) remains high. This unmet need is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the number of women wanting to limit childbearing in this region has been rising, many of these women use less effective short-acting methods instead of more effective methods such as female sterilization. Tubal occlusion via minilaparotomy, using local anesthesia with systemic sedation and analgesia, is the simplest way to provide female sterilization and is a minor surgery that can be performed in resource-limited settings on an outpatient basis, with few complications. Task shifting of surgical procedures to mid-level providers has improved access to lifesaving interventions. Task shifting could increase access to tubal occlusion, especially in rural areas, where demand is high and where most health services are provided by nonphysicians. Two systematic reviews, of older studies conducted primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, suggested that task shifting of tubal occlusion to nonphysicians may be a safe and effective approach to increasing contraceptive access. Three more recent nonrandomized studies offer additional support on the safety of task-shifting tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Well-designed clinical trials are needed to definitively demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of task-shifting tubal occlusion to mid-level providers. We aimed to establish whether the safety of tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy provided by trained clinical officers (COs) was not inferior to the safety of the procedure when provided by trained assistant medical officers (AMOs), as measured by major adverse event (AE) rates during the procedure and through 42 days of follow-up. Task shifting minilaparotomy to COs could widely expand access to this safe and highly effective FP method in Tanzania and beyond.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We enrolled 1,970 participants from seven health facilities and outreach sites in Arusha and neighboring regions in Tanzania between December 2016 and June 2017. Consenting, eligible participants were randomly allocated to minilaparotomy performed by a trained CO or a trained AMO. All procedures were performed using 1% injectable lidocaine for local anesthesia and the modified Pomeroy technique for tubal occlusion. We asked participants to return at three, seven, and 42 days postsurgery. The primary outcome was the rate of major AEs, graded according to predefined criteria, following minilaparotomy performed by COs versus AMOs, during the procedure and through 42 days follow-up. The objectives could be uniquely met through a noninferiority study, designed to demonstrate whether a new “treatment” (minilaparotomy by a CO) is not unacceptably worse than a current “treatment” (minilaparotomy by an AMO). The noninferiority margin was 2%. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of women randomly assigned who had a minilaparotomy procedure. We assessed the primary outcome using the 95% confidence interval for the difference and the ratio between the proportion of participants with a major AE in the CO versus the AMO group. The protocol was approved by U.S. and Tanzanian institutional review boards.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 984 (49.9%) participants were randomly allocated to the CO group and 986 (50.1%) to the AMO group. We analyzed 1,962 participants, 978 in the CO group and 984 in the AMO group. Eight participants were excluded because they did not have a tubal ligation despite being randomized. A total of 1,948 participants (1,948/1,962; 99.3%) completed the study. Available data from participants who withdrew or who were discontinued or lost to follow-up were included in the analyses. Baseline sociodemographic data, obstetric histories, FP use, and reproductive intentions were similar between participants randomized to the two groups. We noted no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of participants having a major AE following minilaparotomy—CO group, 0/978 (0%); AMO group, 1/984 (0.1%) (rate difference: –0.001%, 95% confidence interval (CI), –0.003% to 0.001%). Because the upper limit of the 95% CI fell below the predefined noninferiority margin (2%), the results show that tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy conducted by a CO is noninferior to tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy conducted by an AMO. We noted no significant differences between the two treatment groups in any of the secondary outcomes, including rates of AEs (major and minor combined) at any time during the procedure or follow-up period. Measures of performance did not differ between groups, including mean procedure time, difficulties performing procedures, requests for assistance during procedures, inability to complete procedures, reported pain during procedures, and participant satisfaction. Measures of provider self-efficacy did not differ between the two groups.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results from our large multicenter noninferiority randomized controlled trial provide the first solid evidence that task shifting of tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy to trained COs is safe, effective, and acceptable to women. There were no negative consequences when minilaparotomy was conducted by COs: no evidence of increased risk of major or minor AEs associated with minilaparotomy, no problems with the performance of the procedure, and no negative effects on the level of satisfaction among women undergoing the procedure, all compared with when the procedure was done by an AMO. Additionally, our study was conducted in a setting and in sites typical of developing regions with a high demand for female sterilization, including smaller hospitals and health centers, as well as the provision of minilaparotomy procedures during outreach services, including at lower level facilities such as dispensaries. This service delivery approach is commonly used to increase access to a range of FP methods and other health services in remote, rural, and underserved settings in developing regions. Our results, supported by the previously available evidence, have important implications for FP programs in resource-limited settings, where demand for female sterilization is high and physicians alone cannot satisfy the demand. They provide the necessary evidence to support policy change in such settings to allow task shifting of tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy to COs, thus increasing access to this highly effective and permanent way to limit childbearing and helping to meet the rising demand for the procedure among women wanting to avoid pregnancy.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>En dépit des efforts déployés par le Gouvernement dans le domaine de la planification familiale, la prévalence contraceptive demeure faible. Elle est passée de 15% en 2010 à 22,5% en 2015 (INSD, 2015). Au nombre des obstacles à l’utilisation des méthodes contraceptives figure la faible disponibilité de personnel qualifié pour l’offre de services notamment en milieu rural. En effet, le personnel de santé qui n’est pas autorisé à offrir les méthodes de longues durées représente plus de 60% du personnel de santé en milieu rural. </p><p>L’une des solutions pourrait être la délégation des tâches qui consiste à autoriser cette catégorie de personnels à offrir les méthodes de longue durée et aux agents de santé à base communautaire d’initier l’offre des pilules et d’administrer les injectables. C’est dans ce cadre que le Ministère de la santé en collaboration avec ses partenaires expérimente cette stratégie à travers un projet pilote. </p><p>Bien que la délégation des tâches ait déjà été expérimentée dans certains pays notamment le Ghana, Togo et Sénégal, sa mise en œuvre au Burkina Faso a nécessité le développement d’approches spécifiques pour lever les différentes barrières notamment institutionnelles et communautaires. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Le projet pilote de la délégation des tâches au Burkina Faso est le résultat d’un long processus de plaidoyer auprès du ministère de la santé depuis 2010. Le projet a été opérationnalisé à partir de 2016 à travers (i) le renforcement des capacités des agents de première ligne sur l’offre des méthodes de longues durées ; (ii) le renforcement des capacités des agents de santé à base communautaire sur l’offre initiale des pilules et à l’administration des injectables ; (iii) le plaidoyer et la sensibilisation pour l'accompagnement de la levée des barrières (iv) l’offre des services aux femmes.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>L’expérimentation de la délégation des tâches couvre quarante et sept (47) formations sanitaires de deux districts sanitaires. Ces deux districts sanitaires comptent 162 agents de santé de première ligne pour une population totale de 549 594 habitants dont 122 418 femmes en âge de procréer. Le nombre d’agents de santé à base communautaire est de 224. </p><p>Dans le cadre de cette communication trois principales sources de données seront utilisées. La première porte sur les données de suivi du projet et la deuxième source de données est celles d’une première évaluation réalisée auprès de 20 formations sanitaires pour apprécier la qualité des services offerts par les délégataires à travers les acteurs du projet (délégant (16), délégataires (36), bénéficiaires (122)). En marge de la collecte de l’information, une analyse documentaire ainsi que des focus group ont été réalisés. </p><p>La troisième source de données porte sur une seconde évaluation indépendante en cours de cette phase pilote pour apprécier la qualité et l’acceptabilité de la stratégie. Les trois sources de données de cette évaluation seront utilisées dans le cadre de cette communication pour mieux l’alimenter mais en attendant les données de l’évaluation, nous nous appuierons sur les données de suivi. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>La mise en œuvre du projet pilote de délégation a permis d’avoir des résultats substantiels. Le nombre de nouvelles utilisatrices de planification est passé de 4 993 en 2016 à 7 463 en 2017, soit une augmentation de 49%. Quant au taux d’utilisation des méthodes contraceptives, il est passé de 36% à 43% dans le district de Dandé. De fortes disparités, dues en partie au niveau d’adhésion des populations, en termes d’amélioration du taux d’utilisation des méthodes contraceptives existent au sein des communes du district : le taux est passé de 17% en 2016 à 49% en 2017 dans la commune de Faramana. Dans cette commune, la contribution des ASBC aux recrutements de ces nouvelles utilisatrices est estimée à 18% contre une moyenne de 12% dans le district.</p><p> Dans le district de Tougan, les résultats évoluent lentement : le taux d’utilisation est passé de 20% à 22% avec la contribution du projet : le nombre de nouvelles utilisatrices issues de la délégation des tâches se chiffre à 2059 en 2017. </p><p>Outre l’offre de services, 50 793 personnes ont été touchées par les causeries sur la planification familiale ; 11 382 personnes touchées par le counseling et 14 326 personnes à travers les visites à domicile pour avoir leur adhésion. </p><p>Si la première évaluation révèle une amélioration de l’accessibilité des services de planification familiale, elle reconnait que la réussite de la stratégie passe par une acceptabilité culturelle et communautaire, une plus grande implication et une appropriation de l’ensemble des parties prenantes. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>La mise en œuvre du projet pilote sur la délégation des tâches nous a permis de tirer les enseignements suivants :</p><p>·         La délégation des tâches au niveau communautaire est une stratégie prometteuse pour booster la prévalence contraceptive mais nécessite une approche spécifique des populations pour lever les barrières culturelles et communautaires ; </p><p>·         Les résultats obtenus sont appréciables et témoignent non seulement de l’importance des communautés dans le développement des services de santé mais aussi la réalisation des objectifs de développement durable passe par une implication optimale de la communauté elle-même qui constitue des acteurs clé du secteur de la santé ; </p><p>·         L’implication et le renforcement des capacités des acteurs locaux a permis une réelle démédicalisation, démocratisation et décentralisation des services de planification familiale à travers la délégation des tâches, l’amélioration des rapports entre les communautés et les formations sanitaires et l’augmentation de l’utilisation des services de SR/PF ;</p><p>·         Les agents de santé à base communautaire s’ils sont formés adéquatement et supervisés, peuvent répondre à divers besoins sur le plan des services de la planification familiale.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Service integration has been promoted widely to increase access to essential reproductive and maternal health (MH) services in low- and middle-income countries. Many studies examined the impact of offering integrated services on corresponding service utilization, yet, to our knowledge, there was no assessment of facilities’ readiness to offer such integrated services. Key among readiness indicators in facilities offering integrated family planning (FP) and MH services is the availability of FP methods and essential drugs and equipment for managing the main causes of maternal morbidity and mortality (e.g. postpartum hemorrhage). It has been estimated that, at the country-level, for each additional modern FP method fully available (i.e. no stockouts), the modern contraceptive prevalence rate increases by 6-7%. In turn, this increase is associated with reductions in unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion rates, maternal and infant mortality. Addressing problems with stockouts of FP methods, essential drugs and life-saving equipment is programmatically critical for ensuring high quality, sustainable services. Consideration should be given not only to procurement issues, but to prioritizing the distribution of drugs and equipment to facilities based on routine, rapid assessments of their inventory status and supply needs.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>1) What are the levels and patterns in stockouts of FP methods and maternal life-saving drugs and equipment? 2) Are such stockouts less prevalent in facilities offering integrated FP and maternal health services than those that do not? </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We use baseline survey data from a stratified random-sample of 423 facilities typically offering FP services in three counties in Kenya. Data were collected between November 2017 and January 2018 for PMA-Agile, a project built on the <em>PMA2020</em> platform to generate quarterly estimates of reproductive health performance indicators at sub-national level. We examined stockouts of six FP methods (pills, condoms, injectables, implants, IUDs, emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)); misoprostol (used for management of postpartum hemorrhage); and manual vacuum aspirators (MVAs; used for abortion care, miscarriages) on the day of the survey. Information on FP methods stockouts in the last three months was also collected and used to develop FP provision outcome measures for the six methods categorized as: method not offered, offered with stockouts, offered without stockouts. Facilities offering FP and either antepartum, delivery, postpartum, or abortion care were classified as offering integrated FP-MH services. We explored Bonferonni-adjusted correlations between stockout types, and associations between stockouts and service integration. Multinomial and logistic regression models were fitted for FP provision outcomes and availability of misoprostol or MVAs, respectively, controlling for service integration, key facility characteristics (private/public, type, days/week offering FP, supervision, availability of education materials, number of daily patients), and county. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In the three months before the survey, only 39.5% of facilities offered ECPs and 59.6%-77.3% offered the other five FP methods without stockouts. Slightly more facilities had these methods, especially IUDs, in stock the day of the survey, but only 7.7% and 35.8% had misoprostol and MVAs available, respectively. Of note, there was significant variation in stockouts levels between sites, more so in the public sector and lower-level facilities. There were significant correlations between stockouts of the six FP methods and MVA (all p<p>Overall, 86.5% of facilities reported offering integrated FP-MH services. Integrated service provision was significantly associated with offering all 6 FP methods without stockouts and having MVAs available (all p</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>We used data from the first PMA-Agile survey conducted in Kenya to assess a key component of facility readiness (i.e. no stockouts) to offering integrated FP-MH services. We found FP, MVA and especially misoprostol stockouts to be considerable problems in all 3 counties in Kenya, with significant variations by method, facility type and managing authority. However, FP and MVA stockouts were less prevalent in facilities offering integrated FP-MH services even after controlling for other facility characteristics; no significant association was found between misoprostol stockouts and facilities’ offering integrated FP-MH services. Future studies examining stockouts should account for service integration in addition to other facility characteristics. Our findings are in line with the relatively limited stockouts data from other sources showing great variation between and within countries, and by FP method. While using the FP2020-recommended stockouts indicators in our analysis, we also proposed a comprehensive, three-category, facility-level FP stockouts measure that gives consideration to facilities either not offering all FP methods or offering FP with or without stockouts in the 3 months prior to the survey. There is great need for routine data on FP methods and essential drugs/supplies/equipment stockouts to avoid situations where maternal lives are lost or women interested in preventing/delaying a pregnancy cannot obtain the FP methods of choice. The quarterly PMA-Agile surveys are designed to fill this knowledge gap. Another survey round from Kenya will be available and used in theanalysis to examine whether the problem is chronic or remedial actions were taken if our abstract is accepted for presentation at ICFP.</p>",

      "title": "Do Maternal Care Contacts Improve Postpartum family planning?  Evidence from a longitudinal cohort study in SNNPR, Ethiopia",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The recommended pregnancy interval is a minimum of 24 months, however approximately 60% of women in low and middle income countries are not using effective contraception during the postpartum period.  To improve uptake of postpartum services, WHO recommends that women receive counseling on postpartum family planning (PPFP) during the antenatal, postpartum and the postnatal period, preferably integrated into a comprehensive MNH package. However, the impacts of such services on PPFP is now known.   Ethiopia has an ambitious community health program, relying on Health Extension Workers (HEWS) to provide a range of community based services, including family planning counseling and provision. Coverage of specific components of health services, including receipt of PPFP counseling, is not generally measured. Additionally, receipt of counseling and uptake of PPFP is generally assessed using retrospective report which, along with other perinatal interventions, may be subject to respondent and recall bias.  Data on duration of amenorrhea and dates of sexual initiation, important determinants of pregnancy risk, are not routinely collected and may be difficult to recall over a two- to five-year period.  PMA Maternal and Newborn Health study, which  employed a longitudinal design is ideal to assess correlates of PPFP uptake and receipt of maternal health services.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We used data from the PMA-MNH  study to estimate uptake of modern contraceptive use within six months of birth in the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples region of Ethiopia (SNNP-R) and the association of receipt of maternal health services with uptake of family planning.  We hypothesize that women with greater contacts  to skilled maternal care services will have higher uptake of family planning within six months of birth relative to women who have no contacts to skilled maternity care, after adjusting for relevant socio-economic characteristics.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>PMA-MNH was conducted in SNNP-R between July 2016 and July 2017.  Forty-four enumeration areas (EAs) used in PMA2020/Ethiopia Rounds 1-4 were included.  At screening, 329 women were identified as six or more months pregnant and thus eligible for the study; all consented and enrolled. Over six months, eight women were lost to follow-up.  Receipt and provider of antenatal care, postnatal care, and facility delivery care was assessed at the first follow-up visit.  Uptake of postpartum family planning, including method choice, was assessed at six weeks and six months postpartum in conjunction with amenorrhea, sexual activity, exclusive breastfeeding, and date of family planning initiation.  Exploratory analyses, including the modern contraceptive prevalence rate, distribution of respondent characteristics and the method mix at six months, used survey weights to account for complex survey design. We used unweighted parametric survival regression analysis with Weibull distribution to assess the hazards of contraceptive uptake and associated covariates of interest, including type of ANC provider, facility delivery, sexual activity status, residence, parity, and amenorrhea status.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Fewer than half of all women reported receiving any postpartum family planning counseling prior to delivery (47.2%), despite 82.9% of women receiving at least one ANC visit.  At six months, 43.1% of women reported using any method of contraception.  Of these, implants accounted for 22.4% of the method mix and injectables 66.0%.   Over half of all users of a modern method (55.6%) reported receiving their method from an HEW; these percentages were highest among implant (65.9%) and injectable users (59.8%). Log-rank tests for the equality of survivor functions demonstrated statistically significant differences in contraceptive uptake between type of ANC provider and facility delivery.  After adjustment for other covariates, there were statistically significant differences in women who received ANC care from a skilled provider other than an HEW and women who did not receive ANC care from a skilled provider.  Women who reported at least one visit with health professionals other than an HEW initiated contraceptive use at 1.6 times the rate of women who did not (p=.03).  There were no statistically significant differences between women who delivered in a facility relative to a home birth (HR: 1.16, p=.57). Women who had not resumed sex with their partner since the birth of the child and women who were still amenorrheaic had significantly lower rates of contraceptive uptake than their counterparts ((HR: 0.17, p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Postpartum family planning uptake by six months is relatively high in SNNP-R and not significantly different between urban and rural women, reflecting the commitment of the government to provide comprehensive services to rural populations.  HEWs provide the majority of modern contraceptive services to postpartum women, again demonstrating the success of the HEW program in provision of contraceptive services, and long-acting methods in particular.  The difference in uptake, however, between women who see a skilled ANC provider other than an HEW at least once in their pregnancy relative to women who do not reflects that demand generation and counseling regarding PPFP are not being effectively delivered by HEWs alone.  More information is needed to explain why counseling on PPFP is not being effectively delivered outside of the advanced health care system, but this demonstrates that increased training on PPFP counseling may be needed for HEWs if PPFP is identified as a priority of the Ethiopian government.  Additional focus should also be placed on counseling women that they may be at risk of pregnancy even while amenorrheaic to avoid unintended pregnancies.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>After ‘London Summit on Family Planning’, Government of India adopted RMNCH+A (Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health and Adolescents) program. Since then, the country has accelerated its interventions to focus on the rollout of new contraceptives, focus on quality in family planning, revitalizing Postpartum and Post Abortion Family Planning services, enhanced focus on male participation, and community based schemes through ASHAs, streamlining and strengthening commodity security, Public Private Partnership etc.</p><p>Postpartum family planning (PPFP) is the prevention of unintended and closely spaced pregnancies through the first 12 months following child birth. PPFP reduces both child and maternal mortality because it improves healthy timing and spacing of future pregnancies and limits unwanted pregnancies for those who have completed their families. By integrating PPFP into maternal and child health services, health providers can increase the likelihood that every new mother will leave the clinic having made an informed choice about family planning.</p><p>In present study, we want to analyze the influence of integration of maternal health services and family planning services on time to start contraceptive use in postpartum period after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, and other regional factors.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objectives of this study were to:</p><ul>\t<li>Determine the proportion of women initiating use of modern contraception within 12 months after childbirth.</li>\t<li>Analyze the differentials in the use of modern contraception within 12 months of childbirth by selected socioeconomic and demographic factors.</li>\t<li>Examine the role of integration of maternal health care and family planning services in initiating the use of modern contraception within 12 months after childbirth.</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study used data from the 2014-15 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). The 2014-15 NFHS was a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted for the fourth round in India as part of The DHS Program. The study sample for NFHS-4 is based on stratified two stage sample of households. It produce indicators at the district, state/union territory (UT), and national levels. NFHS provide updates and evidence of health and nutrition indicators, including HIV prevalence. Total 699,686 eligible women of age-group 15-49 and 112,122 eligible men of age-group 15-54 were successfully interviewed. This analysis used only the information from Woman’s questionnaire.</p><p>The outcome variable for the present study was the use of postpartum family planning (PPFP) constructed using calendar information on women who had most recent live birth during one to five years (12-59 months) before the survey. There is no left censoring in our sample however, not all women practiced contraception, so those who did not were right-censored at 12 months. Applying these selection criteria, the final study sample was 140,893 women age 15-49. Kaplan Meier curves and Log Rank test were employed to present our results. Finally, Cox regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Within 12 months following the last birth, nearly 34% of women started using a modern method of family planning and around 9% women started using traditional method of family planning. 10% of women had started using modern contraceptives by the end of the first month after childbirth. The proportion of users shows a gradual increase in the level of modern contraceptive use over the months, reaching 33% after 6 months, 40% after 9 months, and 43% after 12 months. The results from log-rank test shows that survival functions for family planning use postpartum are significantly different for various categories of selected variables (media exposure to family planning, maternal age at last birth, number of antenatal care (ANC) visit, ANC visit during last 3 months of pregnancy, place of delivery of last birth, assistance during delivery of last birth, health visit in last 3 months, parity on last birth, Whether last birth wanted? and socio-economic and demographic variables). Based on score of several questions on maternal health care services and family planning services mentioned above, we made a new variable (MCH_FP_utilazation) depicting combined utilization of maternal health care services and family planning services. In multivariate model, when all potential confounding variables were included in the analysis, the instantaneous risk of starting contraceptive during postpartum period were significantly increased by 1.50 times and 2.00 times (p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The present study was designed to examine the influence of integration of maternal and family planning services on postpartum family planning use in the Indian context. The present study considered ANC, delivery facility and post-delivery health visits and their integration with family planning services together. The study presented several important determinants of postpartum family planning use within 12 months of the last childbirth. Women’ place of residence, higher household wealth and education, exposure to family planning message on any media, presence of son at home, parity and preference for not having another child are some of the important factors associated with higher chances of using contraception within 12 months of the last childbirth. It is recommended that to maintain good reproductive health among Indian women, advocacy is essential to promote maternal health care services continuously, as soon as the pregnancy is noticed. Though these services are widely spread across the country, even at the grass roots level, current services should be convenient and ensure that all women can have access to and receive all three components of maternal health care service and family planning info at the same place. The findings of this study reinforced the need for information and counselling of women to remain in contact with health personnel from the beginning of pregnancy through the postpartum period.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Kenya 40% of the pregnancies are unintended and 14% of these end up in unsafe abortions resulting to 2,600 deaths annually. Under the 2010 Kenyan constitution, abortion can be provided when in the opinion of a trained health professional, a woman needs emergency treatment or her life or health is in danger. Nevertheless, unsafe abortion remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in Kenya. Comprehensive Abortion Care (CAC) services are not usually available to women in need. The health care worker has a role in preventing unintended pregnancies, provision of safe abortion and post abortion contraception. However, the shortage in health workforce, poor interpretation of the law,  inadequate skills, equipment and supplies, data for decision making and providers attitudes towards comprehensive abortion care does hinder quality FP /CAC service provision. </p><p>Closing the Gap (CtG) is a sexual and reproductive health service delivery and advocacy project implemented through a consortium of 6 partners (KMET, Omega foundation, Matibabu Foundation, Dawuoye, NAYA Kenya, and Viagenco) with technical assistance from PP Global and aims to increase access to quality family planning services while  addressing issues of unsafe abortion specifically among young people.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>CtG implemented a three year strategy that promoted integration of family planning specifically long acting reversible contraceptive services (LARC) into CAC services.  The project conducted baseline assessment to 101 facilities, trained 201 service providers and mentored 168, conducted fifteen provider meetings and 22 joint supportive supervision to improve structures, processes and outcomes in provision of FP and CAC.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Cumulatively in three years, 50,408 clients received CAC services with 87% post  procedure Contraception uptake at 16,271 IUDs, 22,862 implants and 4,931 short term methods.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With 83% of service providers  trained and certified on CAC, FP/LARC,  1281 mentorship sessions, 1302 joint supportive supervision and 5 cluster provider meetings conducted, marked improvement of 70% post procedure FP uptake across all the 101 facilities. Additionally, 84% of service providers’ attained competency in integration of Family Planning into CAC services.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Most clients seeking CAC are not willing to get pregnant within the next one year. With proper counselling on FP,  they prefer LARC. However providers are not usually competent to provide LARC services with training, mentorship, they are able the acquire the technical competency for LARC service provision. </p>",

      "title": "Women’s experiences and perspectives on postabortion care and postabortion family planning at public facilities in Dakar, Senegal.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Induced abortion is a frequent practice in Senegal where, despite the restrictive legal context, women resort to it at a rate of 16 per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years. In Dakar, its incidence is 22 abortions per 1000 women of reproductive age. Complications arise from abortion when the procedure fails to evacuate the uterus completely of products of conception (POC), and, if left untreated, it can cause death. Postabortion care (PAC) is a service that addresses this, averting the development of fatal complications by treating them, most often by evacuating residual POC and helping women avoid future unintended pregnancies by proving family planning (FP) counseling and, if the client chooses, contraception. For over 20 years, PAC programs have gone to scale worldwide, with international organizations emphasizing support for this in sub-Saharan Africa, notably Senegal. To guide this process, the World Health Organization recommends use of studies to learn about clients’ experiences and perspectives as part of routine monitoring and evaluation of abortion-related services. We conducted a study to learn about women’s perceptions of the quality of PAC, and postabortion FP, in 10 facilities in Dakar, Senegal, using exit interview questionnaires and qualitative in-depth interviews with PAC clients. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objectives of our study reflected the imperative of PAC to provide high quality emergency treatment and FP services. Using quantitative data, we sought to compare the perceptions of service quality of women that had received PAC through surgical and medical uterine evacuation, respectively, and to identify the main drivers of client satisfaction with PAC. With these data we, also, aimed at understanding which aspects of quality and satisfaction most influenced women’s decision to accept modern contraception during PAC. Through qualitative methods, we sought to explain protocol elements and client needs that PAC services did, and did not, adequately address.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted our study between January and April 2018, enrolling 539 women in exit interviews and 25 in in-depth interviews at 3 hospitals, 3 health centers and 2 health posts in Dakar, Senegal. Our quantitative questionnaire included 12 Likert Scale questions on which PAC clients ranked their perceptions of quality vis-à-vis six domains (client-staff interactions, counseling, technical competence, postabortion FP, accessibility and facility environment), and items on postabortion FP uptake, and a Likert Scale question that asked clients to rank their overall satisfaction with PAC. We first tested for bivariate associations between evacuation method (surgical or medical), client characteristics, characteristics of the care received and clients’ perceptions of quality using Pearson χ2 tests. We then estimated ordinal bivariate logistics regression models between the independent variables used above and our measure on women’s overall satisfaction and, after, using those variables that were significant, we estimated an ordinal multivariate logistic regression model. To determine the factors that influence postabortion contraception, we estimated bivariate logistics regression models between the independent variables used before and FP uptake during PAC, and, using variables that were significant, a multivariate logistic regression model. We analyzed data from the qualitative interviews thematically, using a grounded theory approach.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "Quantitative findings demonstrate that women who received surgical treatment (n=248) and medical treatment (n=291) demonstrated no significant differences in terms of their perceptions of the quality of care. In terms of contraceptive uptake, 47% of clients that received surgical treatment (n=117) accepted a modern method, compared to 28% of clients that received medical treatment (n=82). During in-depth interviews, women reported a desire for more sympathetic staff, reduced waiting times and better counseling on evacuation method options. Clients that received medical treatment, in particular, emphasized their desire for better FP counseling. The women interviewed reported a moderate level of satisfaction with the services they received (mean rating of 2.75 out of 4). Multivariable analysis showed that important domains for high satisfaction were client-provider interactions (OR 2.23, p=0.015), the comprehensiveness of counseling (OR 1.97, p=0.001), access to a variety of contraceptive methods (OR 1.78, p=0.021) and brief waiting times (OR 2.39, p=0.001). During qualitative interviews, women reported the payment of separate fees for complications management and FP as a point of dissatisfaction. 37% (n=199) of women interviewed accepted an FP method during PAC. Factors that significantly predicted this were advanced parity (OR 1.37, p=0.002), completion of primary school (OR 1.81, p=0.03), having ever used contraception previously (OR 1.23, p=0.04), receiving PAC at a health center or health post (OR 2.19, p=0.001), receiving surgical treatment (OR 2.35, p=0.001). Qualitative findings highlighted women’s fears of side effects of contraception, the need to consult their spouses and lack of knowledge on postabortion fertility.",
      "knowledgeContribution": "The quantitative analysis suggests that although most women were satisfied with the services, there are areas that require improvements. Salient among these are the need to reduce waiting times and strengthen the provision of counseling on treatment options and contraceptive methods. The need to improve FP counseling and method provision, it seems, is most pressing in cases when women’s complications are treated medically, with misoprostol, and in higher-level facilities, which receive the greatest service volumes. Findings from our qualitative interviews revealed that the convoluted process of paying for treatment and contraceptive methods separately as a point of dissatisfaction and a barrier to postabortion FP uptake. The most popular contraceptive method among PAC clients interviewed were oral contraceptives (38%), followed by DMPA (35%). Only 14% of clients accepted an implant (n=19) or intra-uterine device (n=9). The factors that influenced postabortion FP uptake did not vary significantly between groups that chose short-acting and long-acting methods. Qualitative findings indicate the imperative to address the needs of younger women in the first or second pregnancies, who commonly harbor misconceptions concerning their eligibility for contraceptive use after abortion and side effects. Although women of all parity levels and ages spoke to the importance of consulting their spouses, the need for actual permission and concerns about spousal discord were most prevalent among younger women with none or one child. Incorporating client perspectives into the design and efforts to improve programs is critical for assuring the quality and overall strength of PAC services.  ",

      "title": "The “Act Now to End Teenage Pregnancy” Campaign: Multi-sectoral Partnerships, Media and Mass Mobilization Drive Results in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Uganda has one of the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy in Sub-Sahara Africa. According to the country's 2016 demographic and health survey, nearly a quarter of girls aged 15 to 19 have had a baby or are pregnant. Adolescent girls are more at risk for maternal mortality—25% of women who die from pregnancy-related complications in Uganda are teenage mothers. Furthermore, multiple studies show that 34% of Ugandan teenage girls drop out of school due to pregnancy, and a World Bank Report indicates that teenage pregnancy costs Uganda 30% of its annual GDP. A fragmented policy environment, limited coordination across relevant Ministries, religious bias towards family planning and a lack of funding have undermined efforts to address what is increasingly recognized as a health crisis across the country.  </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>White Ribbon Alliance Uganda and the Ugandan Chapter of the African Youth and Adolescents Network on Population and Development coordinated an advocacy campaign titled “Act Now to End Teenage Pregnancy”. The campaign calls for the creation, funding and implementation of a multi-sectoral plan to more effectively address teenage pregnancy. Jointly designed and owned by a diverse set of 30 partners, the campaign employed three key strategies: mobilizing young people to demand action and accountability; use of multiple media channels and influencers to highlight the issue; and direct outreach and support to decision-makers.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2015, White Ribbon Alliance  convened partners and key stakeholders from both national and sub-national levels— including youth—to jointly identify campaign asks, strategies and targets. Over the course of campaign implementation, partners undertook a variety of tactics and techniques that aligned with pre-determined strategies. Feedback from targets and stakeholders intimate the following tactics yielded the most positive results.  - Elevating voices of local leaders from districts with high prevalence of teenage pregnancy (e.g. Lira, Mityana, Buikwe, Butaleja, Kabale, Kisoro, Rukungiri, Kanungu and Iganga) via stakeholder meetings documented by media houses and development of a statement read to President Museveni on World Population Day calling for his support in addressing teenage pregnancy. - Cultivating key influencers who include renowned and influential champions of reproductive and adolescent health and Parliamentarians to approach the ministries as well as local celebrities such as local artiste and MP Bobi Wine to speak out to the traditional and social media on the need for action. - Mobilizing 120,000 citizens of whom 70% were young people via U-Report, an online petition, and hardcopy signature forms to demand the Prime Minister act on his powers to coordinate and implement Government policies across ministries to address teenage pregnancy.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>One of the campaign asks was quickly met when, in 2015, Uganda adopted its first, multi-sectoral National Strategy to End Child Marriage and Teenage Pregnancy, primarily due to direct outreach to key decision-makers. However, funding and implementation was non-existent until the petition drive and elevated social media effort in 2016.  These signatures were handed over to the Prime Minister through the State Minister of Primary Health Care at a National Youth Dialogue.  WRA directly engaged the Prime Minister and President of Uganda after they learned about the petition via its large social media presence. Following the petition presentation:</p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>The President and Prime Minister committed themselves to finding multi-sectoral solutions to teenage pregnancy.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs elevated focus with law enforcement agencies on implementation of laws related to rape and child abuse.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>The Commissioner for Youth and Children Affairs committed to carrying out the Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social Development’s initiative on ending early marriage and pledged to work closely with other Ministries to put extra focus on prevention of teenage pregnancy.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Districts such as Butaleja and Iganga developed action plans to address teenage pregnancy and child marriage, while Kisoro District has established a district coordinating committee to address the same.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Ministries of Health and Education and Sports allocated funds to interventions aimed at ending teenage pregnancy in their budgets for FY2017/2018.</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Ministry of Education and Sports passed the National Sexuality Education Policy as part of their commitment in the National Strategy to End Child Marriage and Teenage Pregnancy.</p>\t</li></ul>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>There are multiple lessons learned. First, a shared campaign vision by a wide range of key stakeholders, led by youth, lent greater legitimacy to the process and increased the responsiveness of decision-makers. Bringing groups together early to jointly develop an ‘ask’ based on local priorities was critical to creating broad ownership of and commitment to the campaign over the long-term implementation period. Second, while relying on technical relationships and direct engagement with ministerial contacts enabled a quick win in the form of the national strategy, generating citizen demand was necessary for ensuring commitment and accountability. Thirdly, social media can have a powerful impact in Uganda, but requires broad partner engagement to reach meaningful and influential numbers. Amplifying voices of citizens though media, champions, coalitions and international platforms is key in ensuring that voices of citizens reach decision makers at all levels. Fourthly, giving feedback to citizens and other stakeholders sustains campaign momentum. It’s also important to support duty bearers to address bottlenecks through advocacy at national and international levels. Finally, routine evaluation and adjustment of strategies is necessary as various campaign goals are achieved and the campaign moves into different phases (create--fund--implement). The campaign is recalibrating to conduct district-level advocacy as it shifts to a larger focus on implementation of the national strategy.  </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>As the most populous country in the world, China also possesses the largest youth population of almost 300 million young people (aged between 10 and 24). This equates to 18% of the world’s youth population. China’s rapid economic growth and changing social values are exposing young people to significant sexual and reproductive health risks. Young people are reaching puberty at an earlier age, becoming sexually active earlier and marrying later in life. These trends have resulted in increased rates of teenager, pre-marital and commercial sex. Young people are thus vulnerable to STI/HIV infection, unwanted pregnancies and sexual violence.</p><p>In the past twenty years, life skill training on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) was introduced from abroad in China and adaption of life skill training manuals based on foreigner materials including peer education manuals has been developed. With the development of life skill training both in-school, people who work in the field of SRH recognized parents training on sexual and reproductive health is very important because parents is the best way for communication with children on sexual and  reproductive health. Adolescent and young people will grow up well if parents could communicate and discuss sexual and reproductive health with their children.</p><p>With the support of UNESCO China office, China Family Planning(“CFPA”) developed Connection Training Programme since 2014 in China. Connection Training Programme aims to bridge the communication gap that often exists between adolescent and young people and their parents on issues related to SRH. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In the beginning of the programme, Following the translation and adaptation of the course materials \"Connection\", CFPA identified 30 project sites based on local capacity and interest on parents Sexual and Reproductinve Health (\"SRH\") education. Project sites firstly developed advodacy and public promotion on SRH for adolesents and their parent to create a favorable environment for sexuality education among the general public.Then, \"Connection\" training is provided for parents which including 5 adapted sessions of the Connection course in and out of schools. The contents of the Connection course including:  being female, changes at puberty, menstruation, conception, sexual activity, contraception, abortion, sexual health, alcohol and safety, gender and rights, communication and problem-solving skills in four days.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>CFPA and UNESCO Beijing worked together to provide project sites a series of tools and formats in order to document the proceedings of the local trainings. CFPA developed a national online baseline survey on how parents to perceive their knowledge, attitude and skills regarding SRH education.  Additionally, in order to provide effective technical support, CFPA has set up an online  working group which including trainers, experts and project staff at national and local levels.</p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Till now, over 15000 parents received the Connection trainings in total 30 project sites. Most of trainees’ children are 12-16 years old and in puberty. It is the first time for them to receive such training on how to communicate SRH topic with children and learn specific skills to spend time with their children. Parents welcome the Connection course and become confident and able to talk about sexual and reproductive issue when their children encounter problems in growing up. </p><p>The project has imceased the awareness on SRH in local public, including adolescents, parents, teachers, school presidents, health workers and FPA staff.</p><p>The practice has verified that the project is an effective test for introducing the Connection programme in China. Based on the SRH education in schools and communities, CFPA has complemented its work in families by capitalizing the chance of implementing the project, which will further consolidate the three-in-one model of sexual education based on school, community and family promoted by CFPA over 20 years.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Role play, hidden thoughts, and group discussion are the top three welcomed approaches among the parents who received the training, which help them to talk about SRH issue in a comfortable and friendly way.</p><p>Parents’ interest on the SRH education are strengthened by various ways in and out of training workshops, such as inviting parents to be project volunteers, forming online chat group, and awarding completion certificate.</p><p>The participatory training is effective for adult learning but the facilitation skills of local trainers need more practice and technical supervision.​</p><p>The advocacy on raising awareness on SRH education among parents, school teachers, community members and government should be strengthened.</p>",

      "title": "Parental consent: A hindrance or catalyst to adolescent’s access to contraception in South Western Nigeria",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Improving the reproductive health status of adolescents in Nigeria, has been a daunting task, with efforts geared in the areas of policies and programs. There are policies that focus on provision of comprehensive range of adolescent/youth friendly information, counselling and behaviour change communication in order to foster the adoption of healthy sexual behaviour. To enable them take control of their health, there are no clear policy statements as to provision of contraceptive services for unmarried adolescents by health care providers. Though there are no provisions under the Nigerian law that regulate a young person’s access to contraception services, commodities or purchase of contraceptives including emergency contraception, in practice, the healthcare officer attending a child may require parental consent (i.e. a person who is younger than 18 years), but this is not provided for by law. This is so, because the Nigerian national policy (2009) defines a youth as between 18-35 years, which is contrary to the definition of the United Nations (UN), where a youth is defined as persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years. This programmatic learning aims to review parental consent as a hindrance/barrier to adolescent girls’ 15-17years access to contraceptive services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Adolescents360 (A360) Nigeria, whose goal is to increase voluntary contraceptive prevalence rate of adolescent girls 15-19 years, using the human centred design approach, created safe spaces called “9ja Girls”, where girls can come in seek and access sexual and reproductive health services (SRH) including contraception.  However due to the existing policy in Lagos State around providing contraception to girls below 18years, parental consent forms were designed, approved and introduced to girls below 18 years, who entered the 9ja Girls spaces to access contraception. The forms were introduced to increase parent’s trust, and obtain consent for girls to access contraception.</p><p></p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Adolescents 360 Nigeria uses solutions that reframes contraceptives as the first step to making your future your own, which appeals to girls who come into the 9ja Girls spaces to access SRH services including contraceptives. However, as a result of the project’s target being adolescent girls aged 15-19 years, during the course of intervention, the project experienced some backlash from the community, making contraception for girls 15-17 years a challenge. This resulted in the introduction of parental consent for these group of girls to access contraception as requested by the government of the state.</p><p>For a period of 10 months, using 6 facilities from 2 test sites in the state, every girl 15-17 years who visited the facilities, where the intervention was being carried out, to access contraception, had o first go through an individualized counseling with a trained provider. After counseling and an informed choice made, a consent form would be given, which she had to take home to be signed by a parent or a guardian. Upon return of the signed consent and written and/or oral assent obtained from the girl, a contraceptive method would then be provided.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The intervention which was carried out in Lagos state, south western Nigeria, spanned for a period of 10 months in 6 public primary health care facilities and a private health facility from two Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Lagos state, Nigeria, using a human centred design approach which spanned from the period of prototyping (where prototypes were developed and tested), through pilot of the prototypes, to scale up of the intervention. At the end of the 10 months period, a total of 4,248 girls’ aged 15-17 visited the facility to see a health care provider for counseling and to access sexual and reproductive health services.  From the total number of girls who visited the facilities, 23.4% of girls indicated interest to take up a contraceptive method after going through counseling and a parent consent form given. Out of the 993 girls who were given parental consent forms, only 5.3% of the girls returned with a signed form by a parent or guardian. Even with advocacy sessions held with the mothers of these adolescents, mothers were still unwilling to sign the consent forms for their daughters so as not to be seen as encouraging promiscuity.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This programmatic learning has shown that adolescent girls 15-17 years who seek contraceptive services and are given parent consent forms to be filled, hardly come back and this doesn’t reduce their sexual activity, as it only puts them and their health at risk. Also, girls are likely to get someone else to sign the consent or even go the extra mile to lie about their age when they are able to decide on the importance of pregnancy prevention for a girl who is sexually active and sees the relevance of contraception.</p><p>The current definition of a youth in Nigeria, differs with the global definition, resulting in a policy that not favorable to girls 15-17 years old accessing contraceptive services. There is therefore need for further advocacy to relevant stakeholders towards the review of the policy to capture global best practices, as this group of people could contribute to the achievement of the state’s targeted contraceptive prevalence rate of 74 per cent by 2020.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Au Mali et dans d’autres pays d’Afrique de l’ouest, les grand-mères, jouent un important rôle dans la prise de décision sur la santé des petits-enfants. Elles sont les gardiennes des normes sociales qui influencent la santé sexuelle et reproductive (SSR) des femmes et filles. A travers leurs conseils et comportements, elles influencent la pratique de l’excision, la prise de décision relative à l’âge du mariage, le soin des femmes enceintes et l’utilisation des méthodes de planification familiale (PF). Aussi, elles sont des personnes ressources pour les jeunes filles et garçons, alors c’est bénéfique de les engager pour améliorer la santé des adolescents. L’approche de <em>Grandmothers Project</em> vise à renforcer la communication intergénérationnelle et à valoriser le rôle traditionnel des grand-mères afin de réduire les pratiques néfastes à la SSR des adolescents. Elle utilise l’approche « dialogue et réflexion » pour responsabiliser la communauté à résoudre leurs problèmes au lieu de les dicter des actions à entreprendre. Constatant la valeur de ladite approche, Save the Children, compte l’appliquer pour impliquer les grand-mères dans la promotion de la SSR des adolescents et leur accès aux services de PF. Une recherche formative est menée pour adapter l’approche au contexte de Sikasso, au Mali.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Notre recherche suppose que les grands-mères jouent un rôle de conseillères pour les filles et garçons de leurs entourages et peuvent donc influencer leurs comportements et être leurs sources d’information et de soutiens. Par conséquent, la recherche visait à mieux comprendre le rôle des grand-mères dans la famille et la communauté. Les questions de recherche exploraient leurs rôles et responsabilités influençant directement ou indirectement la santé des adolescents ; leurs connaissances en SSR, y inclus la puberté, la sexualité, les grossesses précoces et la planification familiale (PF) ; et leur influence sur l’accès aux informations et services de la SSR/PF.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Une méthode de recherche qualitative est menée à travers des groupes de discussion focalisée et des entretiens individuels, dans deux cercles de la zone d’intervention de Save the Children, dans la région de Sikasso. Dans chacun des cercles, deux villages sont intentionnellement sélectionnés selon la taille de la population, l’accessibilité géographique, et l’ethnicité. Ainsi, quatre villages différents en termes d’ethnicités sont choisis. Une approbation éthique est obtenue auprès d’un comité d’éthique locale et ce celui de Save the Children à Washington. Les participants sont recrutés par l’ONG locale AGIR, un partenaire de Save the Children et interviewés par les intervieweurs du même sexe. Les participants adultes et les parents des mineurs ont signé un consentement éclairé et les adolescents de moins de 18 ans ont donné leur assentiment. Dans chaque village, à l’aide des guides d’entretien et de façon participative, les données sont collectées auprès des groupes cibles : les grand-mères, filles et garçons de 10-14 ans et de 15-18 ans, hommes, leaders communautaires, enseignants et prestataires de service de SR/PF. Un contrôle de qualité des données ainsi qu’un double-codage sont effectués pour assurer la fiabilité.  Le traitement et l’analyse des données sont faites par thèmes et par une équipe.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Les résultats ont montré que les grand-mères jouent un rôle central dans la famille, surtout dans la vie des adolescentes filles. En générale, les adolescents, surtout les jeunes filles s’entendent bien avec les grand-mères ; plusieurs ont affirmé s’approcher des grand-mères en cas de difficultés et la plupart déclare qu’il n’y a pas de sujet tabou entre elles. Les grand-mères sont également influentes et respectées au niveau de la communauté ; elles influencent des décisions sociales comme les mariages et baptêmes, accompagnent les filles excisées et les jeunes mariées, aussi conseillent les femmes enceintes et qui ont accouché. Les grand-mères sont bien informées sur les changements de la puberté, et elles affirment provoquer des conversations avec leurs petits-enfants dès l’apparition des premières règles ou émission nocturne. Cependant, les discussions sur la sexualité sont rares. Les messages partagés avec les adolescents sont plus sur l’abstinence que les informations sur la fécondité ou la prévention des grossesses. Les messages livrés auprès des filles renforcent l’importance de rester à la maison et d’éviter les garçons. Certaines répondantes mentionnent des connaissances incorrectes sur la période de fécondité et les contraceptifs. Néanmoins, quelques grand-mères expliquent ouvertement aux adolescents les rapports sexuels, les IST et les méthodes de PF. En outre, des filles et garçons attestent que leurs grand-mères les encouragent à visiter le centre de santé (CSCOM) pour la PF. La majorité des grand-mères et des adolescents sont d’accord qu’il est toujours acceptable pour un jeune de visiter le centre de santé.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>dans la culture de l’Afrique de l’ouest et surtout du Mali. Toutefois, elle fait aussi une contribution unique et nouvelle. Notre recherche démontre que les grand-mères sont bien placées, en vertu de leur rôle et influence dans la famille et la communauté, pour soutenir la SSR des adolescents. Ceci est réel dans différents ethnies et traditions culturelles. Les résultats démontrent aussi que les grand-mères sont disposées à adopter des pratiques dissonantes des normes sociales– telles que l’utilisation de la contraception par les adolescents non-mariés – pour protéger l’avenir de leurs petits-enfants. Cette découverte est très étonnant dans les communautés dans lesquelles la recherche est réalisée. En effet, ces communautés sont conservatrices par rapport à la culture donc, l’application de l’approche est très promettant.</p><p></p><p>Une relation spéciale et intime existe déjà entre les grand-mères et les adolescent(e)s donc il suffira tout simplement de renforcer ce lien pour améliorer et approfondir la communication intergénérationnelle. Il sera nécessaire cependant de compléter ce travail avec un effort de renforcement de capacité des grand-mères afin d’assurer que les informations qu’elles partagent soient correctes. Avec ce soutien, les grand-mères seront en mesure de devenir des championnes pour les jeunes et de sensibiliser les adultes dans la communauté pour une meilleure prise de conscience envers la SSR des adolescents y compris l’adoption des méthodes contraceptives modernes.</p>",

      "title": "‘From barriers to allies’: supporting parents to create pathways to adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health in urban and peri-urban settings of Tanzania. ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Among Tanzanians aged 18-24, 60% of women and 51% of men report sexual debut prior to the age of 18. While unintended pregnancy is associated with increased risk of school drop out, as well as preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, just 8.6% of all adolescent girls aged 15-19 are currently using a modern method. Ethnographic research into norms surrounding young people’s acquisition of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) knowledge in Tanzania echo global research findings: community gatekeepers and, in particular, parents play a significant role in shaping young people’s knowledge and access to contraceptive information. Though many parents agree that young people should have SRH information prior to first sex, cultural norms and stigma continue that can place parents as barriers, rather than allies, to youth’s improved SRH outcomes. Funded by the Gates and Children’s Investment Fund Foundations and implemented by Population Services International, the Adolescents 360 (A360) project works in nine regions of Tanzania to support adolescent girls and young women’s improved demand for, access to, and use of modern contraceptive methods as a means of improving SRH outcomes.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>A360 applies a transdisciplinary model combining adolescent developmental science, public health, anthropology, social marketing, and human-centered design to research, design, and implement SRH interventions with and for adolescents girls and young women. The A360 approach centers on adult-youth partnership to generate mixed methods data with girls, about girls and the constellation of factors and actors effecting their SRH and lives. Through this partnership, girls and adult experts collaboratively research, analyze, and iteratively design interventions to address barriers to their SRH service knowledge, access, and use. In Tanzania, A360 is known as, “Kuwa Mjanja,” meaning “Be Smart.”</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Over a series of two-week periods from 2015-2016 , PSI Tanzania and A360 conducted formative research and design with married and unmarried in- and out-of-school adolescent girls  and their influencers  in urban and peri-urban settings of  Pwani, Dar es Salaam, and Morogoro regions. Findings were grouped in themes by girls and A360 transdisciplinary experts, yielding insights that then informed rapid succession prototyping in which intervention components were iteratively designed into one holistic intervention. The performance of the resulting intervention was tracked during piloting using a combination of routine quantitative monitoring and iterative qualitative assessment to understand the perspectives of girls and their community gatekeepers, including parents, as they interacted with the intervention. Monitoring  included tracking of beneficiaries’ attendance at Kuwa Mjanja events and their age, referrals made (via tracking of invitation cards distributed to community gatekeepers), and complete referrals (via tracking of girls presenting with invitation cards at Kuwa Mjanja events), in addition to other service delivery and demographic information.  This mixed methods monitoring revealed insights into parents’ potential role in enabling young adolescents’ attendance at Kuwa Mjanja SRH events.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Findings led to a first Kuwa Mjanja prototype using menstruation education and SRH commodities provision as entré to youth friendly services, through mobile and in-clinic service delivery. This prototype emphasized allowing girls a non-stigmatized (menstruation) means of accessing services. Key insights emerged during field testing:  Though confidentiality was priority for girls, full anonymity—particularly from parents-- was a deterrant to their participation, particularly among younger girls 15-16. Girls dually perceived parents as a barrier to desired SRH services, <em>as well as </em>trusted allies in SRH decision-making, requiring the intervention to thoughtfully pave a path for parental engagement. Subsequent prototypes involved several new components, including parent sessions. Built on dominant themes of empathy for daughters found across all gatekeeper respondents, regardless of their perspective on AYSRH, these sessions focus on assisting parents to learn about the changes their daughters are experiencing, emphasizing pro-social and experiential learning. Trained facilitators lead help parents reflect on their adolescence, discuss, and learn about adolescent developmental stages. Parents discuss and share testimonials, typically including personal experiences of adolescent unintended pregnancies and their effects. By close, parents are invited to commit to inviting their daughters to attend the intervention, receiving invitation (referral) cards. From September, 2016  to December 2017, Kuwa Mjanja conducted 15 sessions and reached 339 parents , with 63% parental commitment to refer girls, and 33% completed referrals. 39% of the total number of 15-17 year old girls seen at Kuwa Mjanja events were referred through parental referrals following parent sessions.  </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Existing ethnographic research demonstrates that parents, and especially mothers, are regarded as stewards of their daughters’ sexual and reproductive maturation in Tanzania—both by their spouses, and their children. Research also confirms that the majority of mothers engage in such messages either through insistence on abstinence or through threats and shame regarding sex. Stigma surrounding youth SRH poses significant barriers to girls’ and young women’s access to critical services. Even among parents willing to discuss SRH, studies show these conversations often only occur after an unintended pregnancy. These realities pose a challenging landscape for girls achievement of positive SRH outcomes.</p><p>The A360 combination of qualitative inquiry and rapid prototyping permitted researchers and young designers to navigate this space together, iteratively refining intervention components to respond to this scenario. Rather than avoiding need for parental engagement by protecting girls’ full anonymity, girls desire parents’ transition to roles as allies in their SRH lives. Today, parents are a consistent means of client referral to Kuwa Mjanja services. Early prototyping of outreach components support the conclusion that parents can be engaged as allies and even pathways to youth SRH service delivery. To date, Kuwa Mjanja’s complex intervention has multiple means of outreach and demand generation for girls and young women. Public announcements and social marketing promotion continue to be among the highest performers in driving client traffic, but effective parental engagement may offer important additional value—enabling girls’ SRH health seeing behavior to shift from clandestine and tacit, to explicit and proud. </p>",

      "title": "Our First Baby: A gender-transformative approach to increase use of maternal, reproductive health and family planning services among first-time/young parents in Mozambique ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Mozambique, where 52% of women age 20-24 are married by age 18 and one-third of women give birth between 15-19 years of age, married adolescent females are extremely vulnerable. Only 5.8% of women ages 15-19 and 11.4% of women ages 20-24 are using modern contraception and unmet need for family planning among women ages 15-24, married or in a union, is 23%. Among women currently married, ages 15-19 and 20-24, only slightly more than half say they make decisions about their own health. Given the increased risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes for pregnant adolescents and high rates of rapid repeat pregnancies among this population, a growing number of programs seek to address the family planning (FP) needs of first-time and young mothers.  Few programs however have addressed the comprehensive reproductive, maternal and neonatal health (RMNH) needs of first-time mothers. Fewer still have taken a gender transformative approach, designing interventions to engage the male partners to address the holistic needs of the young couple. <em>Nos e nosso bebé</em>, or <em>Our First Baby</em> (OFB), is a unique gender-transformative, couple-based approach to increase the use of RMNH services, including contraception, among first-time and young parents (FT/YP) ages 10-25 in Mozambique.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>OFB was designed using global evidence and previous programming experience with FT/YPs. However, recognizing the importance of young male partners in the health seeking behaviors and household well-being of first time mothers, OFB brought a strong gender transformative lens to the design and created one of the first couple-based FT/YP programs.</p><p> </p><p>OFB is a small-group, health education program designed for young couples. It consists of nine participatory sessions led by a facilitator who is a trained reproductive health-community health agent.  Linkages to health services and referrals are made through the facilitator to the health clinic. </p><p> </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>OFB was developed and implemented in three phases, and included an implementation learning agenda to inform future program iterations and scale-up.</p><p></p><p>The OFB package includes a facilitator’s guide, flipbook, and information leaflet to use in small groups.  Content was drawn from existing FT/YP resources, with significant adaptation to focus on the couple and the Mozambican context. They were pretested from December 2016 and January 2017 in Nampula and Sofala provinces with FT/YP, ages 15-25.</p><p></p><p>After incorporating the pretest findings, the materials included nine activity- and discussion-based sessions on ANC, birth planning, contraception, fatherhood, infant stimulation, and nutrition, among others. The OFB package was piloted with 12 groups (122 adolescents – 23 male, 99 female) in Nampula and Sofala. Trained community health agents facilitated the groups, made referrals to health services, and collected feedback on each session to identify areas for improvement.</p><p></p><p>During the routine program implementation phase, as part of the learning agenda, individual and group interviews were conducted with facilitators after completing the nine sessions. FGDs explored OFB content/format, recruiting and retention of male and female participants, and other implementation lessons.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Pre-testing revealed many reproductive health topics, such as menstruation, fertility, family planning, and birth planning were new for the participants. Pre-testing helped program designers identify and understand many of the social and cultural beliefs and practices around pregnancy and post-partum, such as beliefs around certain foods that could harm the fetus. Men were very engaged and interested in the information, dialogue and reflections of their roles. After the pilot phase, facilitators’ provided feedback on the materials, including the content’s complexity and comprehension, length and flow of sessions and physical size. Facilitators’ feedback also highlighted improvements to ensure that sessions were sufficiently interactive and participatory to elicit reflection and discussion among participants about gender norms that affect reproductive health decisions, contraceptive use and parenting. The pilot also provided lessons around gaining support from key community leaders and family members to encourage the youth’s participation. Mobilizing and maintaining men’s participation was a challenge, particularly older men who’s partners were young wives or girlfriends. Strategies to increase and sustain male engagement include ensuring sessions are at the time and location that are convenient for men, for example, when they are off from work, and ensuring that facilitators make men feel engaged and welcomed. The individual and group interviews held after the program implementation phase shed light on changes in knowledge and practices through participation in OFB as well as insights on program implementation processes, such as how to best form and sustain mixed sex groups of first time and young parents.</p><p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>FT/YP are an emerging priority population for increasing contraceptive use and reducing adverse maternal, newborn outcomes. While early programs focused on increasing the knowledge and use of post-partum family planning for spacing births and reducing rapid-repeat pregnancies among FT/YP, few programs include a deliberate approach to engaging men. This program sought to engage men not just in decision making around family planning but to allow them to examine their roles as supportive husbands, good communicators, loving fathers and caregivers.</p><p></p><p>The male voice and experience in FT/YP approaches is often absent or discounted. Gender synchronized approaches require reflection on what men and women gain and give up by equally participating in discussions, activities and decisions that are traditionally gendered female or male. The OFB experience indicates that when given the opportunity, men are willing and eager to play an active role in decision making around fertility choices, pregnancy and childcare, beyond the traditional role of providing financially for their family. For this to happen, constructive dialogue and communication between the young couples are essential. The engagement of community leaders and health staff to encourage the active participation of men in these traditional female areas, while acknowledging both as partners in decision-making, is also critical to success.</p><p></p><p>Lessons learned from the OFB experience will help the Mozambique health programs – and other countries considering how to meet the needs of FT/YP – understand the implementation challenges and promising practices for integrating group sessions for FT/YP into the broader RMNCH health service platform.</p>",

      "title": "Reaching first-time parents with contraceptive information and services in Nigeria and Tanzania",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programs for youth have largely overlooked first-time parents (FTPs)—young women who are pregnant with or have one child, and their partners. These young parents need information and services that can help them achieve the healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies (HTSP), but at the same time, they face multiple social, gender, and economic barriers that limit their ability to practice HTSP and engage in healthy decision-making related to SRH. The Evidence to Action (E2A) Project worked with Pathfinder International to implement FTP pilot interventions in Akwa Ibom State (AKS), Nigeria, and Shinyanga District (SD), Tanzania, to reduce FTPs’ unintended pregnancies by increasing access to broader contraceptive choice. The FTP interventions drew on lessons learned from Pathfinder International’s previous FTP programming and were designed to intervene at all levels of the socio-ecological model: individual, community, and structural. Evidence from these pilot interventions have informed adaptation and implementation of FTP interventions in Cross River State, Nigeria and The Greater Mahale in Tanzania. The FTP pilot interventions are also informing E2A’s development of an FTP Programming Guide, which can be used to inform the design and implementation of SRH interventions tailored for FTPs.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The FTP interventions sought to: create an enabling environment for SRH service uptake by first-time mothers (FTMs), particularly through their participation in SRH-focused group discussions led by FTM peer facilitators; improve the capacity of community health workers (CHWs) to increase access to quality family planning (FP) information and services; and improve facility-based providers’ ability to provide a full range of contraception to FTMs, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). E2A supported trainings and supervision with facility-based providers and CHWs on how to engage FTMs and their partners, and how to provide youth-friendly non-judgmental SRH information and services.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>FTP programs in both AKS and Shinyanga involved interventions that strengthened capacity to understand and respond to the FP needs of FTMs at all levels. This included a peer-led, interactive approach to engage small groups of young FTMs in discussions about HTSP, FP, SRH, HIV, maternal newborn and child health, and activities that build planning and problem-solving skills, including negotiating pressures to have children. Programs also sought to create multiple FP/SRH access points for FTMs, from engaging communities through CHW home visits and linking young women to service outreaches in their communities. Programs also worked with a broad range of household and community influencers to encourage support to FTMs’ access and use of SRH services.  This included building the capacity of facility- and community-based providers to provide friendly and respectful contraceptive services, including LARCs, for young women. In addition to collecting routine service data from facilities, E2A systematically documented the FTP interventions through qualitative data-collection methods with FTM peer group leaders, CHWs, facility-based providers, government stakeholders, and program implementers. In Tanzania, E2A used a mobile app to assist CHWs with counseling skills, and to collect and monitor data on FP service provision at the community level.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>These one-year pilot programs generated important evidence for the relatively new field of FTP programming. Both countries saw promising results in terms of FTMs’ uptake of contraceptive methods. In AKS, 315 women under 25 participated in small peer groups. CHWs reached 202 young women at home with HTSP messages and 881 with contraceptive services. They sensitized 371 household members who influence young women’s SRH decisions. In SD, of 2,615 women counseled, 987 were FTMs. Of 630 new contraceptive users, 254 were FTMs, and of 280 referred for clinical methods to a facility, 110 were FTMs. CHWs sensitized 1,281 key influencers.</p><p>Results show that FTP interventions can reduce young women’s social isolation and increase knowledge of and access to SRH services.</p><p><em>“People’s reaction to family planning, in the past, was on the negative side, because they felt that if they use family planning they will not be able to get pregnant again…but now because of the awareness in family planning, a lot of people have come to embrace it, both husbands and wives.” </em></p><p>– FTM peer group leader, AKS, Nigeria</p><p>“<em>I think there is a great added value in having this innovation. Because some of the CHWs are older people, when they go and face these young mothers they sometimes feel shy to tell them everything. But if a peer speaks with them, it becomes easier for them to express themselves. So, using peer youth is good as they are free to each other.</em>”</p><p>-District Health Officer, SD, Tanzania</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The two programs yielded key findings on how to structure effective programs for FTMs/FTPs:</p><ul>\t<li>Strategies for reaching married vs. unmarried FTMs with HTSP and SRH services, and engaging key influencers, should be different and tailored according to each population’s unique needs.</li>\t<li>Reaching mothers of unmarried FTMs is important as they can be resistant to their daughters accessing contraceptives due to misconceptions about side effects and other negative perceptions.</li>\t<li>Partners and husbands expressed interested in participating in the small peer groups, so approaches to engage them should be expanded.</li>\t<li>FTM peer leaders are important influencers of other FTMs, increasing their in access and referral to contraceptive services.</li>\t<li>Interventions should go beyond contraception, providing health and social services that promote positive youth development. FTMs should be linked to skills acquisition and income-generating programs for empowerment.</li></ul><p>The two programs highlighted the importance of having targeted interventions for this group of young women and their partners.  Mainstreaming SRH services for FTPs to broaden access, including addressing male SRH needs, is key. The FTP approach helped providers and CHWs understand and respond to gender issues of young women and men, fostering a more enabling environment for SRH. Evidence from these pilot interventions can inform interventions for FTPs that can contribute to reducing unintended pregnancies and attaining improved overall health for young mothers, their partners, and their children.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP) supports Tulane University on the MOMENTUM project, a research study in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, to improve the health status of first-time mothers (FTMs) 15-24 years old, married or unmarried. In Kinshasa, 22% of women aged 18-24 are married by the age of 18 and 13.6% have their first birth by age 18. The modern contraceptive prevalence rate is 40% among sexually active unmarried women and 33% among married women ages 15-24 (PMA2020, 2017). Formative qualitative research conducted by Tulane in 2017 found that unmarried FTMs can make the individual decision to use a modern contraceptive method to protect herself from unwanted pregnancies. However, a married FTM must obey her husband’s decision about FP use. FTMs are not expected to use postpartum FP and those who do face social stigma. CCP supports MOMENTUM to reach FTMs, male partners, and community members with critical reproductive health and family planning (FP) information to reduce stigma around FP and demystify its use; encourage intergenerational discussion around FP and male partner engagement; increase social approval of FP; improve knowledge and perceptions of modern methods; and improve self-efficacy to adopt a method among first-time parents (FTPs).</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Based on the findings of the qualitative research, and with the socio-ecological model as a guide, a human-centered design (HCD) approach was used to develop activities that meet audiences where they are (physically and behaviorally), with a particular focus on supporting a positive and enabling environment for FTPs to adopt family planning through engagement with key influencers such as partners, mothers, mothers-in-law (MIL), and friends. Through immersive techniques, co-design, and rapid prototype testing, the HCD process identified and tested channels and message content most pertinent to these audiences.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>CCP worked with the design-thinking firm ThinkPlace to conduct a rapid design and prototyping process in Kinshasa with FTMs and their influencers. Two ideation and prototyping workshops were conducted with several key audiences: FTMs, their mothers and mothers-in-law, partners, and FTPs’ male and female friends. During the ideation workshops, the participants identified the facilitators and barriers for young mothers in accessing FP services, the rumors they associate with family planning, their primary sources of FP information, and the people they confide in about sexual health issues. During these workshops, participants developed ideas for how to reach FTMs and their influencers. During the prototyping workshops, the same participants then developed their ideas into prototypes to be tested in the community. The prototypes were deployed in the community and feedback was collected after each session to further refine the activities. The prototypes were evaluated by distributing individualized “coupons” for a FP session at each of the participating health clinics and counting the number of participants who used the coupon. From March to April 2018, 32 people participated in the prototype workshops. All activities were approved by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s institutional review board.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>During the workshops, FTMs, mothers and MILs highlighted the influence of FTMs’ friends, older sisters, male partners, and mothers/MILs. Major barriers to FP use among FTMs described by participants included fears of side effects, costs of services, and shame about pregnancy and FP use. Nine prototypes were developed by participants to address these issues and tested with 113 influencers in Kinshasa. The prototypes included 1) health talks led by a nurse at a trade school and 2) with a church youth group; 3) screening of video testimonies of mothers, MILs, and male partners whose daughter, daughter-in-law, or partner regretted not using FP or were happy that they used FP, followed by a Q&amp;A session led by a nurse; 4) a “true or false” FP card game with FTMs and their friends; 5) a facilitated Q&amp;A session on sexuality and FP between FTMs and their mothers; 6) a theatrical sketch on FP advertised on Facebook; 7) “big sisters” who recruited FTMs in their neighborhood to use FP services; 8) local hairdressers recruited to refer their clients to FP services; and 9) a peer coaching session with parents on how to talk to their children about FP. The majority of the community’s questions during prototype testing revolved around method rumors and side effects. Participants responded positively to prototypes that challenged cultural norms, encouraged intergenerational discussion on taboo topics in a safe environment, and provided testimonies from real people about FP. The most successful prototypes will be scaled up and implemented in Kinshasa.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Involving key audiences in the development of program activities from the beginning creates community buy-in and leverages existing networks. Many of the participants in the ideation workshops said they had never been involved in the development of activities before and were grateful that their opinions and ideas were included from the beginning of the process. The participants know their neighborhoods well and were essential to connecting CCP with community leaders and finding locations to test the prototypes that would best fit the needs of community members. Using already trained nurses and community health workers enabled the rapid deployment of prototypes and reduced preparation time. Few financial resources were needed to implement the prototypes, since they took place at local community structures using mostly existing communication tools.</p><p>Given the wide range in key influencers' age and experience, the HCD approach allowed CCP to test a variety of activities that are tailored to each audience's learning preferences. Since the ideas came from the influencers themselves, the content and material was based on what they find interesting and engaging. The activities from the workshops complement each other: some are focused on relationship building and increasing communication about FP between FTMs and each of their key influencers, while others focus more on conveying accurate information on FP and dispelling rumors among all the audiences. Implementing these different types of activities together with multiple influencers is a wholistic approach to developing a supportive environment for FTPs to use postpartum family planning. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning (FP) is nowadays acknowledged as one of the most successful development interventions with benefits on maternal and child health, and on socioeconomic achievements. Yet in sub-Sahara Africa especially, despite undeniable progress made during the last decades, contraceptive use is still low (28,4%) with however large variations between regions: 64% in Southern Africa compared to only 17% in Western. Much higher are the inequalities within countries, often observed between urban and rural areas or between socioeconomic groups.</p><p>According to Kilbourne et al., (2006), disparities in FP are due to three categories of factors: client’s preferences and behaviors, reproductive health care system factors, and provider related factors. These factors have been are grouped by Pritchett (1994) in demand related factors and supply related factors.</p><p>As several African countries, Rwanda experienced similar inequalities by the past. With however the last decade up-scaling family planning program, poor populations recorded higher uptake than rich leading to a substantial narrowing of the existing gap. Between 2005 and 2014, uneducated women for example progressed by 4.4 times versus only 1.3 times for those with better education. The question is how does this happen?</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This paper aims to analyze the pathways through which the contraceptive gap between the poor populations and the rich is narrowing in Rwanda. More specifically, the research examines the extent to which the demand for children has evolved differently between the poor populations and the rich and how the differentials in trends are associated with the types and sources of contraceptive methods used.</p><p>Understanding these mechanisms is essential for both policymakers and providers in Rwanda as well as in other countries to evaluate and improve their FP programs to take the best way towards a sustainable fertility control.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This study uses a pooled dataset from the 2005, 2010 and 2014/15 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The research is restricted to married women as this is the standard sample used to measure contraceptive use. The key dependent variable is use of any contraceptive method. The main predictor is socioeconomic status measured by two indicators: educational level and household wealth index. The trends in reproductive attitude and family planning services are assessed through the change in desired fertility and the desire for family limitation by women at low parity (<p> Descriptive statistics show the trends in contraceptive use, in reproductive attitude, as well as the types and sources of contraceptives. Multivariate logistic regression models estimate the effects on contraceptive use of the predictors. To assess the change overtime, we have sat three models. The first includes predictors and five control variables. Models 2 and 3 add to the first interaction terms between education or household wealth index and year of survey. The STATA 13 is used to perform the logistic regression.</p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong><em>Contraceptive use in Rwanda over the last decade</em></strong></p><p>Results show a pattern of poor-rich inequalities narrowing in the use of contraception between 2005 and 2014. In 2005, better educated women for instance were about 3.7 times more likely than those with no education to use contraception; the ratio dropped to 1.4 in 2010 and to 1.1 in 2014. Similar results are observed when used wealth index. The multivariate analysis confirms the tendency of convergence by displaying negative coefficients for interaction terms indicating a significant decline of educational/household wealth gap in contraceptive use overtime.</p><p><strong><em>Trends in reproductive attitude and family planning services</em></strong></p><p>Over the last 10 years, the desired fertility declined in all socioeconomic groups with however higher change among poor (-0.7/-0.8 births among no educated versus -0.2 for better educated). As result, the exceeding desired fertility of 1.2 children (4.7–3.5) expressed by women with no education in 2005 dropped down to 0.7 children in 2014. In addition, at the same low parity, uneducated women willing to limit their offspring increased (7.5%) while those with secondary or more declined (-0.7%). Comparable results are displayed with household wealth index.  </p><p>Whatever the indicator used, results indicate that changes in contraceptive methods (decline of traditional methods and increase in modern) are larger among the poor populations than among the rich. About the sources of supply, it appears that the Community Health Workers program, the new introduced supply chain, benefited more the poor populations than the rich.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Findings from this study show that there has been an impressive overall increase in contraceptive use in Rwanda between 2005 and 2014, with higher uptake among the poor populations leading to the narrowing of poor-rich inequalities in contraceptive use. Various factors contributed to the exceptional contraceptive adoption among the poor. First, the mindset in regard to reproductive attitude changed more among them than among the rich increasing the demand for contraceptives. The decline in desired fertility has been associated with land scarcity in rural areas and lack of jobs outside agriculture lowering the benefits from many children. The second factor is the improvement of reproductive health services through the introduction of community health workers program, the expansion of FP services to underserved areas, and the promotion and extension of Long Acting Methods to lower health service units such health centers.</p><p>The first implication of the study is that the increase in CPR among the poor people requires innovative and country specific strategies that lower high reproductive attitude and remove contextual barriers. The second lesson is that the Community Health Worker program revealed effectiveness among the poor people. It therefore should be recommended in similar settings. Lastly, the study calls African governments to prioritize investment in FP among the poor and rural populations if they want to curb the current high population growth that hamper socioeconomic development. Reaching poor and rural residents in Sub-Sahara Africa is reaching the whole country given their share in total populations.</p>",

      "title": "Estimating coverage of family planning services using routine service data in Rwanda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Many countries use the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) as a key performance indicator for monitoring their family planning programs. Often this is disaggregated for married women or women in union. However, this indicator is not available routinely to monitor progress against national targets due to the high cost of conducting the household surveys required to estimate it.  Most countries can only afford to implement such a survey once every 2 to 5 years.</p><p>While household survey data and facility reported data are not strictly comparable for a number of reasons (described in the limitations section below), most countries collect data on family planning through their routine health management information systems that can be used as a proxy for CPR.  This analysis focuses on using routinely collected data in Rwanda – the number of continuing users at the end of the month (Users EOM) - to calculate family planning service coverage rates for all women as well as for married women.  Estimating CPR for married women is especially difficult, because family planning data are rarely disaggregated by marital status when reported through routine health information systems. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In Rwanda, family planning providers in public and private facilities report a variety of reproductive health indicators each month through the Rwanda Health Management Information System.  Users EOM is calculated by counting the number of users currently using each method after excluding those who have dropped out or were lost to follow-up during the month.  To calculate the unadjusted FP coverage rate, this number is divided by an estimate of the women of childbearing age (15-49 years) in the catchment population (25.1%[i]).</p> <p>[i] Rwanda Population and Housing Census 4, 2012, National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR)</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>When triangulating data between health facility-based unadjusted FP coverage and CPR from population-based surveys after past DHS surveys in in Rwanda, there appears to be significant over-counting in the facility-based data – especially in recent years.  The variance between DHS CPR and unadjusted FP coverage rates has ranged between +36% (2014) and +11% (2010).  This is likely due to the difficulty of using the current paper-based data collection methods (FP registers) to estimate continuing users. The reported numbers typically include many users who have dropped out, become lost to follow-up, are duplicates or are above the age of 49 years.  In order to adjust for this variation, we multiply the users EOM by an adjustment factor to bring the users EOM back in line with the CPR. Once we have established a closer correlation between CPR and FP coverage rate for all family planning users, we use DHS data and a formula to estimate FP coverage for married women by multiplying the numerator (adjusted users EOM) by the proportion of family planning users who were married (63% in 2015) and multiplying the denominator (women of reproductive age) by the proportion of women sampled who were married (35% in 2015).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>This formula enables Rwanda to track estimates of FP coverage on a regular basis, providing important information for program managers and policy makers. Between 2012 to 2017 the estimates of coverage for all women rose from 24% to 30%, while estimates for married women rose from 41% to 52%.   The data shows significant dip in users EOM in 2015, most likely due to changes in the FP policy that year requiring a copayment for FP services and by efforts made by the RBC/Family Planning team to clean up FP registers after the release of the early DHIS 2014/15 results.  </p><p>While the indicator provides reasonable results at national level if the DHS sample is representative, it is less likely to be reliable at different levels of disaggregation – urban/rural, by district - if the population is heterogeneous.</p><p>If contraceptives are widely available outside of the health system  or if reporting rates are low from health facilities, the estimates are likely to be significantly different from the prevalence rate reported from household surveys.  According to the RHMIS, only about 1% of the contraceptive users reported receive their contraceptives from private health facilities  in Rwanda (a proportion that has remained consistent from 2014 through 2017).</p><p>If FP data recording systems differ substantially between health facilities, for example: if some use registers and others use a tickler file or electronic systems, then the national level adjustment factor used to align the adjusted FP coverage rate with the CPR is likely to be too high.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>These formulae have been created within the Rwanda Health Management Information System (RHMIS), so that health workers and managers at any level can track the evolution of these proxy indicators monthly, quarterly or annually since 2012 when data was entered in the DHIS-2[1] software platform.</p><p>Using adjusted FP coverage rates as a proxy indicator for CPR is an effective way to monitor the progress of family planning programs – especially at sub-national levels where data from national surveys are not representative.  Building these indicator calculations into the health information system (such as the DHIS-2) can simplify use of this indicator and avoid calculation errors. The indicators can be assessed annually or on a monthly basis.  While the absolute values may differ from CPR and may not be comparable between locations, health workers at sub-national level can track the evolution of the indicators to better understand the effectiveness of their own FP interventions.</p> <p>[1] DHIS-2: The District Health Information System-Version 2 is the DHIS 2 is the flexible, web-based open-source information system that was developed by the Health Information Systems Program (HISP) and University of Oslo (UiO) and is used in over 45 countries for the collection and analysis of routine service data.</p>",

      "title": "Increasing Access to Critical Family Planning and Reproductive Health Services for Burundian Refugees in Mahama II Camp, Rwanda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Since the beginning of April 2015, there has been a steady stream of Burundians refugees coming to Rwanda and surrounding countries.  A total of 88,500 individuals are registered as refugees in Rwanda and Mahama Camp hosts an estimated 57,721 refugees. Within an emergency-affected population, an estimated 4% will be pregnant and 15% of those pregnancies will need medical assistance; thus, quality reproductive health (RH) services are essential.</p><p>Save the Children International (SCI) provides comprehensive primary health care services for approximately 29,000 Burundian refugees in the health center at Mahama Camp II. There is a notable need for family planning (FP) among the refugee population. The total fertility rate (TFR) in Burundi is 5.5 and modern contraceptive prevalence (mCPR) among married women is 23% as compared to a Rwanda’s TFR of 4.2 and mCPR of 48% among married women.  To address this unmet need as well as the overall need for reproductive health services that arise in humanitarian settings, Save the Children International (SCI), in coordination with the Rwandan Ministry of Health, strengthened integration of family planning and post-abortion care (PAC) services into the primary health care program at Mahama II Camp starting in January 2017.   </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>After identifying a need for quality RH services in Mahama II camp, SCI first took a context-specific capacity-building approach for RH.  Using a competency-based training methodology, health providers were trained on the provision of FP and PAC services with a focus on long-acting contraception. The balanced counseling strategy plus (BCS+) approach to family planning counseling was adopted to facilitate integrated FP services into services such as antenatal care, HIV testing and treatment, vaccination, and general outpatient services. Specific FP and PAC related messages were integrated into the community mobilization activities and tailored to specific groups, such as adolescents.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The project utilizes a range of tools to monitor the quality and outcomes of the project. Training and supportive supervision checklists link to an online dashboard that guides the supervisor in prioritizing supervision and training needs. Annual register reviews as well as monthly data reviews and discussions among project staff - including focal points for community mobilization and the youth outreach - are used to identify facilitators and barriers to service delivery and allow for programmatic decision-making.  Based upon the review and analysis, actions are taken to improve quality and accessibility of services.  Community leaders are engaged through the monthly community dialogue sessions. The primary health care program recently initiated an overall quality improvement approach using the <em>Plan, Do, Study, Act Cycle</em> that provides a platform for integration of the various standardized quality improvement tools used for FP and PAC services. Through this mixed methods approach to monitoring program quality and integration, SCI and MOH staff can ensure in real time that the RH needs of Burundian refugees are met.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Since the start of the program, a rapid training needs and site assessment identified resources and gaps in health worker PAC and FP knowledge and competencies as well as existing training capacity. An online health information system based on DHIS2 was established to provide real-time data on key program indicators, allowing for more rapid decision-making. The training and supportive supervision dashboard was launched in November and training was conducted in March 2018 to strengthen skills in using the tools and dashboard to improve quality of care. </p><p>Register reviews are conducted annually. In June 2017, the mean FP client age was 27 years and 60% of clients were older than 24.  The majority of clients (99%) were from Burundi with 1% from Rwanda. Adolescents 15 – 19 years of age comprised just 7.1% of women accessing contraceptive services at Mahama II.  Based upon analysis of this data, the project is planning a refresher training in postabortion care and family planning, highlighting the specific needs of adolescents.   </p><p>Though the program commenced recently, overall long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) uptake increased from 25% in the first half of 2017 to 33.2% in the later half. In the same period, the number of PAC clients treated increased by 64%. Similarly, during the same period, the percentage of PAC clients adopting a method of family planning prior to discharge increased from 30.3% to 40.7%, reducing the overall recurrence of abortion.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The results demonstrate that FP and PAC can be successfully integrated into emergency primary health care programs; however, significant initial inputs such as health worker competency-based training, supportive supervision, provision of commodities, and specific quality improvement interventions are needed. Additionally, it is essential to integrate key messages and provide forums for discussion about FP and RH within community mobilization activities carried out by community health workers and peer educators.  While these services may be integrated within the existing human resources and program delivery system, an RH focal point is needed to initially lead and ensure integration throughout the community and health facility level. In order to provide quality FP and PAC services, continued efforts are needed to integrate FP and PAC competency-based training into pre-service training, on-the-job training and preparedness training is needed. Further, favorable national policies in conjunction with strong relationships and capacity-building with the Rwandan MOH, such as including MOH trainers in competency-based trainings, encourages the transition from humanitarian response to development programming.</p>",

      "title": "Rwandan Government family planning mobilization efforts impact national, community, and individual conversations and motivations to utilize family planning",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Rwanda’s family planning program has achieved unprecedented gains over the past decade. Between 2005-2015 alone, contraceptive use soared from 17% to 53% for married women. Among other interventions, the government has sponsored various media campaigns that seek to elicit positive attitudes towards contraceptive use. A combination of radio, television, and newspaper campaigns have been utilized to reach all corners of the county. Their efforts have indeed been successful; total demand for family planning increased from 55% in 2005 to 72% in 2010. These mobilization efforts are integral to the growth of Rwanda’s family planning program; demand is likely to increase as more women see that contraceptive use is socially acceptable. The government’s focus on normalization of family planning has shifted Rwanda’s social landscape so that most married women feel comfortable seeking out contraceptives; however, research shows that youth and unwed women still feel that family planning is not an option and total demand for contraceptives remained stagnant at 72% between 2010-2015. In the wake of this stagnation, it is imperative to reflect on the ways in which narratives about contraceptive use are reproduced within the national, community, and interpersonal levels and how they might change to become more inclusive.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The goal of this research is to use qualitative focus group discussions to learn from Rwanda’s family planning nurses and community health workers. Their unique relationships with a variety of women who utilize family planning allowed them to share assessments of the interpersonal communication that occurs between spouses, families, and peers with regard to contraceptive use. This knowledge, along with their perspectives on the broader community education efforts that they often organize, helps to uncover and contextualize the strong impact that interpersonal, community, and national mobilization efforts have on Rwanda’s increase in demand for family planning services.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This qualitative study on Rwandan family planning service delivery was conducted in February of 2018 in  the Musanze and Nyamasheke districts. These districts were selected because they represent the areas of the country with the highest and lowest rates of modern contraceptive prevalence rates, respectively. The data for the study consist of four focus groups conducted with CHWs (two in Musanze and two in Nyamasheke) and four focus groups conducted with family planning nurses (two in each district as well). A total of 84 respondents spent between 1.5 and 2.5 hours with two native Kinyarwanda speakers leading the focus group discussions. The topic guide included a story vignette - regarding unwanted pregnancies for married and unmarried women and adolescents in rural regions of Rwanda, a sorting and listing exercise, as well as questions about typical clients and interactions with clients. Audio recordings and written notes were transcribed into English. Data analysis was guided by the thematic content analysis approach and executed using Atlas.ti 8 software and group level matrices. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington and with the Rwandan Ministry of Education prior to collection, and respondents signed informant consent prior to participation.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Within every focus group discussion, study participants brought up the concept of women and neighbors “mobilizing” each other to seek out family planning. Participants described scenarios where women gave direct advice to their peers about family planning, shared their own experiences, or simply modeled the balanced lifestyle that they could uphold due to their use of contraceptives. Many participants noted that most new clients come to see them because her friend or family member had told her about the benefits of contraceptives.</p><p>Participants also discussed various community education events that help to shift Rwanda’s societal norms so that family planning is seen as acceptable, responsible, and for the good of the nation. Women who may lack an informal setting to discuss contraceptive use can go to organized events and hear testimonials from others about the benefits of family planning. Participants emphasized the great impact these societal shifts have had on the national increase in demand for contraceptive use; their jobs have become more demanding due to the surge of families who would like to utilize their services.</p><p>Despite these positive comments that were made about interpersonal and community efforts, participants also highlighted some societal barriers that continue to endure. Every focus group noted that young and unmarried women often believe they should not use contraceptives. Furthermore, some religious institutions that have great influence over community values and norms still condemn the use of family planning. These barriers were seen as potential setbacks for demand generation and national contraceptive prevalence.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The results of this research call for a recognition of the impact that social norms have on the level of demand Rwandan women have for contraceptive access. The decision to utilize family planning occurs only partially from individual agency; spousal, familial, communal, and national norms all serve to inform each woman’s choice.  Although the government is not directly present during interpersonal communication among citizens, their national and community education efforts can indirectly influence the initiation and content of these private conversations in a positive way. This can lead to broader support for family planning users from their families and neighbors. In recognition of the impact these mobilization efforts have had on demand generation thus far, they can also be seen as a tool to return to when questioning how to combat the recent stagnation and the potential plateau in contraceptive use and demand that often occurs within the family planning programs of developing nations. A focus on national and community support for contraceptive use among sexually active youth and unmarried women could help to combat the current stigmatizing narratives, thus allowing a larger population of women to consider their contraceptive options without fear of disapproval. As these top-down efforts find their way into interpersonal communications, barriers will be lifted and overall demand generation is likely to increase.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Since the 1960s governments and international organizations have made large investments in family planning programs. The aim of these programs is to provide access to and information about contraception. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of agreement about the impact of these programs on contraceptive prevalence and demand and on fertility. Proponents of the programs argue that these programs are essential to reproductive health and point to the high levels of unmet need and unplanned pregnancies as the key rationale for investing in these programs. Critics argue that socioeconomic development and in particular female education is the main driver of changes in reproductive behavior and that family planning programs have only a minor impact on trends in contraceptive use and demand.</p><p>This paper aims to shed light on this continuing controversy.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main question that motivates is this study is the magnitude of the impact of family planning programs on contraceptive prevalence</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Location: sub-Saharan Africa</p><p>Study design: This quantitative study examines long range trends in prevalence in sub-Saharan countries.</p><p>Data sources: 1) DHS surveys from 1990 to 2016, 2) The United Nations model estimates of family planning indicators from 1970 to 2015, 3) Wittgenstein Center for Demography and Global Human Capital Wittgenstein for estimates of mean years of education from 1970 to 2015, and  4) World Bank Development Indicators for estimates of GDP per capita and percent urban.</p><p>Time frame, 1970-2015</p><p>Sample size: 24 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a population size above 5 million in 2015. Eleven observations per country at five year intervals from 1970 to 2015.</p><p>Analysis approach: The impact of the family planning program is estimated by comparing levels of prevalence after controlling for level of development indicators (education of women of reproductive age, GDP per capita and percent urban). Methods include graphical comparisons and fixed effects regressions.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The main finding is that family planning programs have a substantial impact on prevalence and demand satisfied after controlling for education level and other socio-economic factors To illustrate, consider a plot of trends in modern contraceptive prevalence (mCPR) by mean years of schooling of women aged 20-39. This figure contains 24 lines, one for each country with data points from 1970 to 2015. The figure suggest a loose clustering of countries into the following five groups according to their status in 2015:</p><p>Group 1: Cameroon, Nigeria DR Congo. As noted, these countries have low mCPR and very little program activity, despite their substantial schooling level.</p><p>Group 2: Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia have moderately high education and mCPR, but their transitions are not as far along as group 3. Moderate to strong programs. </p><p>Group 3: Kenya and Zimbabwe have high mCPR and high schooling levels. These countries have long-standing programs, that are now strong (after some fluctuations in the past).</p><p>Group 4: Rwanda, Madagascar, Malawi and Ethiopia have high prevalence ranging from 35 to 55, despite only modest schooling levels (around 4 years). The mCPR is much higher than expected from schooling levels alone. This indicates a strong FP program effort.</p><p>Group 5: Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have very low levels of schooling, but their mCPR is around 15-20. This is higher than expected from the level of schooling and reflects moderate FP program activity in a setting with low demand.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The study provides estimates of the net impact of family planning programs on family planning indicators over time, after controlling for socio-economic development, including education. Program impact varies widely from strong in a number of countries in Eastern and Southern Africa to extremely weak in Nigeria and DRC. Upturns of prevalence coincide with the onsets of sustained government investment in and commitment to family planning programs.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Despite a drop in global rates of unintended pregnancy, the proportion of pregnancies that are unintended remains high, especially in the developing world. Unintended pregnancy can endanger the health of women and their families, and reflect, among other factors, barriers to contraceptive access and use. A number of studies has been linked the unintended pregnancy with poor prenatal care, high risk pregnancy behaviors, increased rates of preterm birth and low birth weight. The relation between unintended pregnancy and poor nutritional outcomes of women has been extensively studied, but less is known about the effect of an unintended pregnancy on postpartum depression.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The present study makes an effort to examine the effect of unintended pregnancy on maternal postpartum depression in four low and middle income countries. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The present study used data from the first waves of the Young Lives Study (YLS), which was conducted in India, Ethiopia, Peru and Vietnam during 2002. The analytical sample size to examine the effect pregnancy intention on postpartum depression was based on 1859, 1861, 2019 and 1871 women aged 15-49 years from India, Ethiopia, Peru and Vietnam respectively. The outcome variable of interest was postpartum depression. The information on postpartum depressive symptoms was collected soon after the birth of the child. The postpartum depressive symptoms were measured using WHO recommended tools of self-reported 20 items (SRQ20) that consists 20 questions and answer of each question were reported in yes/no/don’t know with a reference period of last 30 days. The key independent variable of interest was pregnancy intention (intended, unintended. The survey asked women “At the time you became pregnant with index child, did you want to become pregnant”. If women reported “yes’ then it was coded as intended pregnancy and if the response was “no” i.e, mistimed/unwanted, then it was coded as unintended pregnancy. Bivariate analysis was done to compare the postpartum depression by pregnancy intention.

A highest percent of unintended pregnancy was reported in Peru (46%) followed by Ethiopia (38%), Vietnam (17%) and India (8%). The prevalence of postpartum depression was highest in Ethiopia (32%) followed by Peru (30%), India (30%) and Vietnam (21%). Results of bivariate analysis shows that a prevalence of postpartum depression was higher having unintended pregnancy than intended pregnancy. The prevalence of postpartum depression among women of unintended pregnancy was about 44%, in Ethiopia, 38% in India, 35% in Peru and 23% in Vietnam. On the other hand, a lower percent of women having unintended pregnancy were reported postpartum depression in Ethiopia (26%), India (29%), Peru (26%) and Vietnam (21%). The result of multivariate logistic regression analysis also shows that women having unintended pregnancy were significantly more likely to experience postpartum depression in Ethiopia (odds ratio: 2.18, 95% CI. 1.77, 2.67) and Peru (odds ratio: 1.37, 95% CI. 1.13, 1.67) than women of intended pregnancy. Results of pooled data analysis also shows that women having an unintended pregnancy was significantly more likely to be experience postpartum depression (odds ratio: 1.37, 95% CI. 1.13, 1.67) than women of intended pregnancy. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The present study analyses the effect of pregnancy intention on postpartum depression among women in selected low and middle income countries. Our study is based on a relatively large study population from countries that are underrepresented in mental health research, and information on effect of unintended pregnancy on postpartum depression is lacking. There is urgent need to be repositioning family planning program in reproductive and child health care program in developing countries.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Periodic estimation of the incidence of unintended pregnancy is needed so that policy makers, researchers,and other stakeholders can track progress towards helping women and couples achieve their reproductivegoals. It also helps demonstrate the need for contraceptive services and the impact of programmes and policies onunintended pregnancies and their outcomes. These estimates can additionally be used to examine variationsin how women resolve unintended pregnancies across settings and over time. Most unintended pregnanciesoccur in developing regions where, combined with limited access to safe abortion care, they are an importantcontributor to unsafe abortions worldwide. Moreover, unintended pregnancies are widely acknowledged as botha cause and a consequence of socioeconomic inequality. Estimates of pregnancy incidence by intention status and outcome indicate how effectively women and couples are able to fulfil their childbearing aspirations, and can be used to monitor the impact of family-planning programmes.</p><p></p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Past estimates of global unintended pregnancy incidence relied primarily on computation of subregional averages using available country data and the assumption that these averages apply to countries without data. Building on a method recently developed to estimate global levels and trends in induced abortion for 1990–2014, and using estimates of abortion incidence for that period, as well as the body of available data on the proportion of births that are unintended, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical time series model to estimate subregional, regional, and global levels and trends in the incidence of unintended pregnancy over the period 1990–2014. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We developed a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the unintended pregnancy rate is afunction of the distribution of women across subgroups defined by marital status and contraceptive need and use,and of the risk of unintended pregnancy in each subgroup. Data included numbers of births and of women estimatedby the UN Population Division, recently published abortion incidence estimates, and findings from surveys of womenon the percentage of births or pregnancies that were unintended. Some 298 datapoints on the intention status ofbirths or pregnancies were obtained for 105 countries.This is the first time that unintended pregnancy has been estimated using a statistical model, that differences in data quality have been accounted for, and that uncertainty intervals have been estimated. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Worldwide, an estimated 44% (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 42–48) of pregnancies were unintended in2010–14. The unintended pregnancy rate declined by 30% (90% UI 21–39) in developed regions, from 64 (59–81) per1000 women aged 15–44 years in 1990–94 to 45 (42–56) in 2010–14. In developing regions, the unintended pregnancyrate fell 16% (90% UI 5–24), from 77 (74–88) per 1000 women aged 15–44 years to 65 (62–76). Whereasthe decline in the unintended pregnancy rate in developed regions coincided with a declining abortion rate, thedecline in developing regions coincided with a declining unintended birth rate. In 2010–14, 59% (90% UI 54–65) ofunintended pregnancies ended in abortion in developed regions, as did 55% (52–60) of unintended pregnancies indeveloping regions.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Between 1990–94 and 2010–14, the global unintended pregnancy rate declined, and the magnitude of the decline and the extent to which this corresponded with a decrease in unintended births or abortions varied across geographical areas. The unintended pregnancy rate remains substantially higher in developing regions than in developed regions. In developing regions, the unintended birth rate fell while the abortion rate held steady, whereas in developed regions the abortion rate, but not the unintended birth rate, declined. Developing regions saw a decline in the intended birth rate, which reflects the increasingly widespread desire for small families, as well as a decline in the unintended birth rate, which indicates that a growing proportion of women and couples have been able to realise their fertility goals. These trends are probably due at least in part to family-planning programmes, which have led to an increase in the prevalence of contraception.</p><p>The findings underscore that women and couples are having smaller families and fewer unintended pregnancies in many parts of the world. The findings also emphasise the continuing need for investments to meet women’s and couples’ contraceptive needs. Unintended pregnancy rates remain much higher in developing regions compared with developed regions, and many of the resulting abortions are unsafe. Additional research on the causes and consequences of unintended pregnancy are needed to compel appropriate investments in programmes and design policies that meet the needs of women and couples everywhere. </p>",

      "title": "Re-evaluating the Mistimed and Unwanted Births and their Association with Childhood Stunting: New Evidence from India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Childhood malnutrition is one of the major public health issues in developing countries especially in India, and it has several adverse outcomes. According to an estimation, India has about 48 million pregnancies, and nearly half of them are unintended. A large size of studies established mixed results regarding the association between the unintended births and childhood growth. In India, a few studies found that there is a significant effect of unintendedness of births on their subsequent stunted childhood growth and poor health outcomes. These studies state that the conscious and unconscious discrimination towards the unintended children leads to the disadvantaged childhood growth. But they don’t explain the economic viability of the parents to cherish their larger number of under-five children in the resource-poor families; wherein this factor stands out to be of importance. Further, these studies assumed unintended births (mistimed and unwanted) as the indicator of poor family planning. However, the measurement and concept of unintended births depend upon different contextual factors. On the other hand, due to short birth spacing, and repeated births, the children who were not reported as unintended could have stunted growth and poor health outcomes. Therefore, this study revisits the relationships using evidence from India.  </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Using the evidence from the National Family Health Survey (2015-2016) of India, this study addresses two research questions. First, what is the relationship between preceding birth spacing and childhood stunting in India? How far the mistimed births mediate the effects of preceding birth spacing on the child stunting? Second, how is the family size (number of living children) related to the childhood stunting in India? Does unwantedness of child mediate the effects of family size on the child stunting?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The definition of mistimed births was captured through the direct question asked to the women whether their last child was ‘wanted then’, ‘wanted later’ and ‘wanted no more’. The children who were reported ‘wanted later’ are considered as mistimed births. The unwanted births were estimated in two ways: first, those who were reported ‘wanted no more’ are categorised as unwanted (first definition); second, the mothers whose actual family size (number of living children) is higher than the desired (ideal) family size reported by the respondents (second definition).  </p><p>The bivariate relationships of childhood stunting with preceding birth spacing and the mistimed as well as between family size and unwanted births children were presented. Three sets of adjusted multilevel models were applied to capture the mediation of mistimed and unwanted (first and second definition) births in the relationship of child stunting with the preceding birth spacing and family size respectively. Given the wide geographical variation in India, the state, district, primary sampling unit (PSU) and household were considered as the levels of estimates. A separate multilevel analysis was carried out for an interaction variable between the desired family size and unwantedness of births (second definition) for better understanding. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The results from the multivariate model show that the odds of being stunted are higher among the children with 36-47 months (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.13, Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.09-1.18), 24-35 months (OR: 1.31, CI: 1.26-1.36), and </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "The summary findings show that the risk of childhood stunting has a significant positive relationship with the decreasing preceding birth spacing and increasing family size in India. The mistimed and unwanted (as measured from both definitions) children are neither significantly different in childhood stunting from those who were wanted then nor significantly mediate the role of preceding birth spacing and family size respectively in reducing the childhood stunting. Moreover, the desired family size has a significant moderator role in the association between childhood stunting and unwanted births.<p>The reporting of the mistimed and unwanted births have individualistic, cultural and contextual dimensions. At the individual level, motivation in engaging in the sexual activity is different from having the intention of childbearing, and unpreparedness of being pregnant could be intended only after pregnancy. On another way, the intendedness is the continuum between the motivation of the desire for a baby, and the preparedness of childbearing, education and life goals. The cultural perspective of childbearing in general and sex composition of the sibling, in particular, have a bearing on the intendedness of births. The pregnancy intentions are not only the women’s decision but also her associated individuals such as their partners, relatives, peer groups, health workers with a multiple interwoven sociocultural and economic influences. Thus, the reported mistimed and unwanted births are <strong>not certainly lead to poor childhood growth, rather</strong> a healthy birth spacing and small family size through family planning would have better outcomes. </p>",

      "title": "The association between the desire to avoid pregnancy and Ghanaian women’s choice of contraceptive method",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Use of contraception in Ghana increased dramatically, from 13.0 percent in 1988 to 23.5 percent in 2008 [GSS 2009], and total fertility subsequently declined. However, since then, use has plateaued and, between the 2008 and 2014 Demographic and Health Surveys, declined slightly to 22.8 percent [GSS 2015]. The current level of unmet need for contraception in Ghana is high, at 30% for married women [GSS 2015] and 42% for unmarried women [Machiyama &amp; Cleland 2014], and low use of contraception is one important contributor to the stubbornly high level of maternal mortality in the country. Ensuring women are receiving contraceptive methods of their preference is one way to increase use [Pariani et al., 1991]. However, investigations into African women’s contraceptive method preference is a topic which has been largely ignored. When the topic has been studied, it has mainly been investigated using demographic and health surveys (DHS), to retrospectively measure which individual-level demographic and community-level factors are associated with women using one method of contraception over another. This use has then been interpreted as method preference. However, the strength of women’s desire to avoid becoming pregnant is an important factor in determining which method of contraception they want.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In this study, we explored Ghanaian women’s desire to avoid pregnancy, as measured by self-report on the Desire to Avoid Pregnancy Scale (DAP) [Rocca 2016], and investigated factors associated with this. We believe that the desire to avoid pregnancy may be related to factors such as marital status (with women who are unmarried having a higher desire to avoid pregnancy), parity (with women of higher parity having a higher desire to avoid pregnancy), and age (with both the youngest and the oldest women having higher desire to avoid pregnancy).  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Women presenting to 5 family planning clinics in Ghana’s two largest cities were interviewed before their contraceptive counseling session. Women who were starting a new method of contraception, or were switching to a different method, who were 18 years or older, and who could understand English, Twi, or Ga met the inclusion criteria. Participants were asked which method of contraception they most preferred, and also the 14-item Desire to Avoid Pregnancy Scale. The mean DAP score was used as the dependent variable in a linear regression. Women were also asked about other factors that have been found to be associated with method choice in the past, including age, marital status, highest level of education completed, and parity. Age was originally collected as a continuous variable, but as both lower and higher age were hypothesized to be associated with the DAP, this was categorized into five separate variables, aged 18-20, 21-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35 and older. Women’s most preferred method of contraception was initially collected categorically. For analysis, a LARC variable was created for those women stating a preference for either an implant or an IUD. Those factors which were associated bivaritely were entered into a multivariate model.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A total of 543 women participated in our survey. They ranged in age from 18-53 years (mean: 28.3, s.d. 6.3). Just over half of the participants were married (55.6%, n=296), and almost all (96.4%, n=513) had had at least one pregnancy. The sample was generally educated: 15.6% (n=83) reported having no education, 12% (n=64) had only primary school education, 39.1% (n=208) had junior secondary school education, 22.2% (n=118) had senior secondary school education, and 10.9% (n=58) had more than secondary school. Almost half (n=256 (47.1%)) most preferred a short term hormonal method (either an injection or the pill), and 282 (51.9%) most preferred a long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method (either an implant or an IUD). The mean DAP score for all participants was 3.88 (s.d. .56), and this did not differ by demographic information collected (age, marital status, highest level of completed education), although women who had had more pregnancies were more likely to have a higher DAP score. Women who wanted a LARC device had a significantly higher DAP score than those wanting other methods. When demographic information was controlled for, women who wanted a LARC device had a DAP mean .137 higher than those who did not (p=.006) and for each additional pregnancy, women’s DAP score increased by .044 (p=.005).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Women who have a higher desire to avoid pregnancy in these clinics are more likely to prefer a LARC method. Understanding women’s desire to avoid pregnancy as one factor associated with method preference can improve the quality of contraceptive provision. We know that women have different levels of tolerance for avoiding pregnancy. Women with a stronger desire to avoid pregnancy may be better candidates for LARC methods which have very high efficacy rates. Ensuring women are provided with contraceptive methods that meet their preferences, including their preferences to avoid pregnancy, is important to improve satisfaction, and hopefully to increase the number of women who adhere to their method.</p>",

      "title": "What indicates reproductive empowerment: joint decision-making, or deciding alone? New insights from a mixed-methods study in Nepal.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Dyadic power differentials that shape reproductive decision-making is of perennial interest to social science researchers. While consensus decision-making is a critical component of empowerment, evidence linking decision-making to reproductive behaviors like contraceptive use is inconsistent[1]. Current measures of decision-making that focus on joint decision-making, versus a singular individual alone, are also ambiguously interpreted, yet these are lines of questioning commonly used on standard, nationally representative surveys, often as a proxy for empowerment.</p><p>Our study takes place in Nepal, which has experienced dramatic demographic change over the past two decades, with fertility falling from almost five per woman in the 1990s to just above replacement level. This has been accompanied by an almost doubling in use of modern contraception over the same period[2]. These changes suggest that the norms around family formation, sexual behavior, and reproductive decision-making are likely to be in a process of change, making it a particularly relevant context in which to explore these questions. This is especially true given the persistence of gender inequitable norms and cultural practices such as child marriage.</p> <p>[1] See e.g. Upadhyay et al. 2014; Pratley et al 2017.</p><p>[2] Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The main question addressed through this analysis is: to what extent do standard measures of decision-making adequately represent “empowered” decision-making in the reproductive realm? We hypothesize that standardly used measures, such as those in the DHS and PMA2020, insufficiently provide information that would allow researchers to categorize women adequately as being “empowered.” We hypothesize that by adding only a few additional questions, we can improve upon our understanding of what joint versus deciding alone means for empowerment.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2017, we conducted a mixed-method study in two peri-urban regions of Nepal (Kaski and Morang) to develop and test new measures of reproductive decision-making agency (RDMA). The RDMA measures contained four core questions, six contextual questions, and were applied to five reproductive domains (e.g. when to have children). To start, we qualitatively explored the meaning of RDMA with men and women through focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) that used cognitive interviewing techniques. Next, we imbedded our RDMA measures into a quantitative survey, which contained additional questions about demographic and relationship characteristics. During quantitative data analysis, we developed a composite RDMA variable based on three domains, which categorized the sample as having high, medium and low RDMA levels.</p><p>Quantitative participants were sampled using a three-stage design using a random-based household approach. In total, we conducted eight FGDs, 24 IDIs, and administered the quantitative survey to 1000 women and 200 men.</p><p>For this analysis, we compare the quantitative RDMA data against standard questions where respondents answered joint, husband/wife, or themselves alone as the main decision-maker, on all five domains. We contextualize these findings—specifically, the areas of incongruence—through additional regression analyses and against the qualitative findings.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The RDMA measures were internally consistent within domains, across domains, against other demographic variables and as compared to standardly asked questions (e.g. those using DHS/PMA2020-style format). Our results indicate that RDMA is high in this sample, and highly depends on the reproductive domain in question. We found significant areas of agreement (p-values not shown) between the RDMA and DHS/PMA2020-style measures. For example, we categorized 72.1% (n=315) of women reporting mainly joint decision-making on when to have children as having high RDMA. Across domains, the majority of women reporting joint decision-making were categorized as having high RDMA. However, there were areas of incongruence, e.g. we categorized 38.5% (n=164) of women as having high RDMA who, in the DH/PMA2020-style question about when to have children, reported the husband alone makes the decision. Men’s data followed similar trends.</p><p>Further investigation of the data reveals new insights into the nature of these incongruent men and women by exploring other demographic and relationship data for this group, as well as stratifying based on whether there was disagreement. Qualitative data strongly reveal normative and authoritative male decision-making across all RH domains, even when both men and women frame the decision-making process as consensual.  Any disagreement pivots agency away from women, especially when it comes to having the first child, use of modern FP, and having sexual intercourse. Although joint decision-making is idealized, the implementation of that ideal is infrequent, and the implications of it differentially matter when the opinion about the decision is shared, versus</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This analysis reveals new insights into the perineal question about whether joint decision-making, or decision-making alone, indicates higher empowerment for women. Our data show that the decision-making process, especially joint decision-making, is more complicated and nuanced than traditional measures can quantify, and depends on which reproductive health decision is being made. While woman making decisions alone certainly indicate higher levels of empowerment, joint-decision making is more ambiguous. Although additional research needs to be done to further understand those women reporting joint decision-making, our research suggests that by adding a few additional questions to a set of decision-making measures, we can collect more nuanced data and still retain the parsimony required for efficient yet robust investigation using population-based surveys.</p>",

Women’s decision-making power is one of the reproductive health rights as women’s with lower decision-making power were more likely to have a low birth weight and high rates of unintended pregnancy and pregnancy related morbidity and mortality. And also reproductive ill health being much greater for women which represents one-third of the total burden of the diseases among women of 15-44 years, with unsafe sex a major risk factor. Married women in rural areas especially face many difficulties to decide to utilize their reproductive health and rights even services were accessible due to many reasons. To achieve universal coverage of reproductive health women should make independent decision themselves regarding their own reproductive health and rights (RHR). Many studies identified factors affecting women reproductive health service utilization but still studies concerning the level of women’s decision making and power factors affecting their decision especially in rural areas were lacking. This study is also significant as it provides cogent policy recommendations for the design and implementation of economic and non-economic interventions into women’s empowerment.</p>",

Public health interventions targeting women's RHR should take into account strengthening rural micro-credit enterprises, qualities of spousal relations were recommended and priority should be given to women with no formal education of husband or herself and those marriage duration of less than 5 years. Further qualitative studies on longitudinal base to explore the sociocultural factors like taboos, values, believes on sexuality etc. were also recommended for women’s higher decision making power on RHR in their households.</p>",

      "title": "Empowering adolescent girls and young women through mentorship and sisterhood: results and lessons learned from the Rapariga Biz Program in Mozambique ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Mozambique’s population is strikingly young, with half the population younger than 18 years. It is also marked by sharp gender disparities, limiting the control women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives and hampering their ability to develop to their full potential. A full range of complex drivers are at the roots of this situation.</p><p>The adolescent birth rate stands at 194 births per 1,000 adolescent girls aged 15-19 (IMASIDA, 2016), 46% of adolescent girls aged 15-19 are either pregnant or already had a child (IMASIDA, 2016) and 48% of young women were married as children (DHS, 2011). While education is key to empower the female population, young women’s illiteracy rates nearly doubles that of young men and data indicates that very few girls aged 15-19 completed primary education. There is also a feminization of the HIV epidemic, particularly affecting this age group.</p><p>The Government-led a 4-year Rapariga Biz program addresses the unfulfilled sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of adolescent girls and young women in the two most populous provinces of the country: Nampula and Zambezia.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Rapariga Biz is the first joint UN program targeting adolescent girls in Mozambique, and includes technical assistance from UNFPA (leader agency), UNICEF, UNESCO and UN Women. Under the leadership of Government, it is implemented by youth and CSOs, community and religious networks, public service providers and media. The program includes:</p>\t<li>Mentorship of adolescent girls and young women in safe spaces in communities (main focus of this presentation)</li>\t<li>Provision of adolescent and youth-friendly services in health facilities and schools</li>\t<li>Comprehensive Sexuality Education</li>\t<li>Economic empowerment of adolescent girls and young women</li>\t<li>Community mobilization and behavior change communication</li>",
      "methodology": "<p>Between June 2016 and December 2017, Rapariga Biz has trained almost 2,300 female mentors and mentored 98,083 adolescent girls and young women between 10-24 years in safe spaces in the 14 targeted districts. The mentors are trained in mentorship, SRHR, human rights, citizenship and life skills, among other relevant aspects. They are 3-4 years older than the girls and come from the same communities. The safe spaces are identified by the girls and provide them with a safe, free and trusted space to express themselves, share experiences, establish new healthy behaviors and informed choices, discuss and learn about their SRHR, human rights, participation and life skills. In a group of 30, the girls and young women meet once a week for 4 months.</p><p>The presence of a mentor allows for the adolescent girls and young women to be mentored and guided at an interpersonal level. They also act as references for issues such as sexual and reproductive health, education, and justice services. For example, mentors support and encourage out-of-school girls to return to school.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Rapariga Biz is only two years into its implementation and has not yet been evaluated. However, program monitoring data indicates that positive progress is being achieved on girls and young women’s empowerment and SRHR. After 2 years of implementation, only 1.1% (1,000) of girls between 10-19 years undergoing mentorship entered an early marriage and only 0.5% of the girls in the safe spaces had an undesired pregnancy. This suggests that Rapariga Biz is significantly demonstrating a difference compared to the provincial and national average - and is effective in inducing behavior change.</p><p>Additionally, another key area of progress is the use of the family planning services: 78% (49,568) of girls and young women among the target group visiting youth-friendly services or a health facility adopted at least one family planning method other than condoms. This is 26% higher than the provincial average during the same period.</p><p>More intangible progress in terms of adoption of specific life skills and different gender roles among the target group has also been reported.</p><p>In light of the above, it needs to be considered that some girls may have dropped out of the Program once pregnant or before marrying. In addition, there may be a bias in that the girls joining the Program may already be those more empowered and thus, less likely to marry or have children at an early age.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The multiple roles of the mentors evidently has a positive influence; they are role models living in the same community, champions of different empowering gender roles, provide a support system outside of the safe spaces and assist the target group in translating information and knowledge into informed choices or changing in SRHR-related behaviors. The girls’ network also proves to be fundamental in tackling and overcoming some of the socially rooted gender inequalities they are confronted with.</p><p>The recommendation is to replicate the approach in similar programs.  </p><p>The work of the mentors also involves multiple challenges. Some report being confronted with difficult social situations such as gender-based violence against young girls. This may lead to mentors feeling frustrated and powerless. The lesson here is to provide psychological and therapeutic support for the mentors and closer monitoring.</p><p>In the face of these challenges, some mentors are still demonstrating an emerging leadership potential. It appears that having a visible role in the community, specific responsibilities given to them and serving the well-being of other girls and young women empowers the mentors significantly. The lesson here is to further invest in and build on this leadership potential of mentors.</p><p>Given the persistent gender inequalities that cut across multiple aspects of girls and young women's lives, the still low national contraceptive uptake, and the rapid population growth Mozambique is currently experiencing, this program holds a unique opportunity for designing effective interventions that will address these inter-related challenges.</p>",

      "title": "Family Planning Use and Correlates among Female Sex Workers in a Community Empowerment HIV Prevention Intervention in Tanzania: A Case for Tailored Programming",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are at heightened risk for unintended pregnancy in addition to their heightened risks for HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections (STI). Increasingly, research is being conducted on FSWs’ reproductive health (RH) and family planning (FP) needs and use of services, but little is known about the predictors and correlates for (non)use of those services. FSWs’ family planning needs are similar to other women of reproductive age, but they also present unique challenges, such as heightened HIV/STI risks and multiple partnership types with whom they may have differing fertility desires. Given gendered power dynamics, they cannot necessarily rely on clients to use condoms consistently. Additionally, FSWs face constrained access to healthcare services, including RH/ FP services. Community empowerment models are effective at reducing HIV incidence and improving condom use among FSWs and could theoretically improve FP use also. Thus, while HIV prevention interventions are not specifically designed to improve family planning use, tailored and sensitive reproductive health services embedded within a broader community empowerment approach may be more effective at meeting FSWs’ RH needs than services that are designed to meet the needs of the general population of women of reproductive age.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The aim of this analysis is to describe the correlates of use of modern family planning methods among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected female sex workers within the context of a community empowerment intervention in Tanzania. This analysis hypothesized that exposure to the empowerment intervention is positively associated with modern family planning method use compared to women unexposed to the intervention.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This is a secondary analysis of a community-randomized trial conducted in Iringa, Tanzania, 2015-2017. The trial (Project Shikamana) evaluated the effectiveness of a community empowerment-based combination HIV prevention model among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected FSW in two communities (see Kerrigan, JAIDS 2017). FSWs were defined as adults who reported exchange of sex for money within the past month and were recruited from venues where they worked. The analysis includes participants (n=384) with 18-month follow-up (FU) data available for key outcomes (modern FP use). Modern FP methods is defined as current use of either injectables, implants, pills, intrauterine devices, male or female condoms. Program exposure variables included attendance at a Shikamana study center, obtaining condoms from Shikamana, and attending a FP training session at the center. Predictors of FP use included demographics (age, community, education, marital status, ethnicity, biological HIV status); work-related risk factors (number clients per week, consistent condom use, venue type); and reproductive histories (lifetime pregnancies, previous FP use). Bivariate (chi-squared tests) and multivariate analysis (logistic regression, controlling for clustering by venue) were used to test associations between program exposure and current FP use, controlling for covariates that were significant at the p=0.10 level in univariate analysis.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Only 223/384 participants (58%) reported current use of modern FP methods at FU, though n=323/384 (84%) reported lifetime use at baseline. Common methods at FU were injectables (n=84/384, 21%), male condoms (n=65, 17%), and implants (n=54, 14%). Less common were female condoms (n=18, 5%), pills (n=16, 2%), IUDs (n=7, 2%), and female sterilization (n=12, 2%). Dual method use (condoms plus another method) was <p>In univariate analysis, modern method use was not associated with age (median 27), education (71% ­&lt;primary school), marital status (57% unmarried), ethnicity (58% local), HIV status (48% infected), number of clients per week (45% had &gt;2) and consistent condom use (52% consistent). Participants in the intervention community had significantly greater odds of current use of modern methods compared to women in the comparison community (crude OR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.07-2.15, p=0.019]). Previous use of modern FP methods reported at baseline was also significantly associated with current use (crude OR 4.84, 95%CI:2.76-8.48, p=0.000).</p><p>In multivariate analysis controlling for community and previous FP use, modern method use was significantly associated with any attendance at the Shikamana program center (adjusted OR 2.45, 95%CI:1.44-4.18, p=0.001); and attending a FP-related meeting at the center (aOR 3.80, 95%CI: 1.65-8.77, p=0.002).</p></p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Female sex workers’ family planning use was significantly greater in the intervention community at follow up compared to the comparison community. Additionally, exposure to the intervention was significantly associated with modern FP method use, even when controlling for previous FP use. This was true of any exposure, and not only attending a FP-related session. This suggests that community-empowerment based interventions for FSWs can positively impact FP use, even when FP is not the main target of the intervention. Interestingly, factors generally associated with FP use (age, educational level, marital status, consistent condom use, and HIV status) were not associated with current FP use in this population. This highlights the different socio-structural dynamics FSWs may face in their work that require sensitive and tailored programming to meet their reproductive health goals and outcomes. Although FP use among FSWs tends to be higher than the general population of adult women, there is greater risk of unwanted pregnancy, HIV, and STI. Continued unmet need in this population is more likely to be resolved by tailored, sensitive programming that does not require partner involvement, as a majority did not have intimate partners/husbands. For this sample of FSWs, consistent condom use remained low, and dual method use extremely low; better promotion of dual method use is necessary to meet FSWs’ multiple risks. Multipurpose technologies in the research pipeline that prevent pregnancy, HIV and other STI are especially important for FSWs, as is PrEP for uninfected FSWs who want to safely conceive.</p>",

Condition suffisante pour consacrer cette thématique autour du recours à l’avortement. Partant de cet état, l’on se propose de rechercher les déterminants du recours à l’avortement par les femmes de 15 à 49 ans à partir des données de l’EDSC-II par les méthodes statistiques explicatives.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Le contexte politique en matière de santé de la reproduction au Cameroun témoigne de deux articulations majeures. La première est celle de l’objectif fixé en 2001 dans le Document de la Stratégie Sectorielle de la Santé (2001-2015) qui est d’augmenter la prévalence contraceptive des méthodes modernes de 19,3 à 30% au moins en milieu urbain et de 5,9 à 15% en milieu rural d’ici 2015. Cependant, la dernière Enquête Démographique et de Santé (2011) estime ces prévalences à seulement 20,8% et 8% respectivement. Ceci qui remet en question l’efficacité des instruments adoptés. La deuxième orientation concerne le repositionnement du planning familial en 2015 comme instrument de la réduction de la mortalité maternelle dont les niveaux préoccupants sont estimés à 782 décès pour 100.000 naissances vivantes. Le programme «Family planning 2020» est adopté avec comme objectif d’augmenter la prévalence contraceptive moderne de 16,1% en 2011 à 30% d’ici 2020.</p><p>Ce travail se focalise sur l’<strong>autonomisation des femmes mariées dans le couple</strong> comme facteur propice à l’appréciation des résultats de santé productive du ménage, l'utilisation de la contraception en particulier.</p>",

      "methodology": "<p>Cette recherche utilise les données de la dernière Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples (EDS-MICS) réalisée au Cameroun en 2011. Un échantillon de 2973 couples représentatifs a été constitué. Toutefois, comme l’étude se limite aux couples dans lesquels les femmes n’étaient pas enceintes, 461 couples sont exclus. L’échantillon total est donc composé de 2512 couples.</p><p>Le pouvoir de négociation de la femme est mesuré par un <strong><em>Indice Composite du Pouvoir de Négociation</em> (ICPN)</strong> construit par une Analyse des Correspondances Multiple (ACM) sur quatre dimensions: le contrôle sur les ressources financières, la position économique dans le ménage, les caractéristiques intrinsèques relatives au mari et la prise de décision dans le ménage. Quant à l’usage de la contraception, elle prend la valeur 1 si la femme utilise au moins une méthode et 0 si non. Ainsi, l'usage d'un modèle <strong>probit</strong> semble approprié. Cependant, comme le pouvoir de négociation est potentiellement endogène, la méthode <em>Two Stage Probit Least Square</em> (2SPLS) va également être employée. Le <strong><em>sexe du chef de ménage</em></strong> est alors utilisé comme variable instrumentale du pouvoir de négociation.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Les résultats des statistiques descriptives montrent que c’est dans la dimension de la position économique à l’intérieur du ménage que la femme a le pouvoir de négociation le plus élevé suivi de la dimension du contrôle sur les ressources financières, de la dimension des caractéristiques intrinsèques et en dernier lieu de la dimension de la prise de décision.</p><p>Les résultats du probit et du 2SPLS suggèrent que le pouvoir de négociation de la femme et l’usage de la contraception sont positivement liés puisqu’une unité supplémentaire de l’ICPN augmente la probabilité de recourir à la contraception. Cependant, l’effet obtenu dans le cadre de l’estimation du 2SPLS est à peu près vingt fois supérieure à celui obtenu dans le cadre de l’estimation du modèle probit. En plus, le Fisher-test de validité de l’instrument indique le sexe su chef de ménage est une VI du pouvoir de négociation convenable.</p><p>Par ailleurs, il ressort également que tout comme l’instruction du mari, l’éducation de la femme (secondaire et supérieure) est positivement liée à l’usage de la contraception et que cet effet positif augmente à mesure que le niveau est élevé. La religion et le milieu de résidence (rural) par contre n’ont aucune influence sur la contraception. La richesse du ménage est également un facteur déterminant : plus le niveau de richesse augmente, plus la femme a tendance à recourir à la contraception.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Ce papier contribue aux connaissances d’un point de vue méthodologique et politique. Concernant l’approche méthodologique, ce papier incorpore dans son analyse l’endogénéité du pouvoir de négociation de la femme par la méthode du 2SPLS. Or, aucune étude dans la littérature sur le sujet à notre connaissance n’a eu recours à ce modèle. Les résultats de ce modèle nous enseignent que plus de pouvoir de négociation aux mains des femmes est favorable à l’utilisation de la contraception et que négliger son endogéneité sous-estime considérablement son effet sur la santé reproductive.</p><p>Relativement à la politique de santé en vigueur, elle a pour objectif de réduire les taux élevés de mortalité maternelle par une augmentation considérable des femmes sous contraception d’ici 2020. Les résultats suggèrent que l’une des pistes clefs à l’appréciation de la prévalence contraceptive est l’autonomie de la femme dans le ménage dans la prise de décision.</p><p>Par conséquent, les politiques publiques ne doivent plus seulement se focaliser sur le système de santé en lui-même, mais également, elles doivent se pencher sur les politiques sociales de revalorisation du statut de la femme dans le ménage avec une certaine acuité. De plus, ces politiques doivent accorder une attention à la facilitation de l’accès des femmes aux ressources éducatives, puisque les résultats évoquent qu’une femme éduquée est apte à décider de la taille idéale de sa famille.</p>",

      "title": "Scaling up the REAL Fathers: Evaluating the integration of family planning into an effective family violence prevention intervention in Uganda",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Efforts to prevent intimate partner violence (IPV) and increase family planning (FP) use are often addressed separately, despite evidence of overlapping risk factors and behaviors (Gilles 2015). Originally piloted as a violence prevention program between 2013 and 2015, the Responsible, Engaged and Loving (REAL) Fathers Initiative employed a community-based, father-centered mentoring approach to reduce IPV and violence against children (VAC). Over seven months, mentors had 12 points of contacts with young fathers, through individual and home visits.  Community posters with emotion-based messages were also displayed to catalyze reflection on gender equitable norms and positive parenting. REAL was shown to be effective in reducing IPV and physical punishment of children and improving positive parenting behaviors (Ashburn et al. 2016). Following these promising results, a FP component was added to the package in the expansion phase in the Northern and Karamoja regions of Uganda. The FP-added sessions included content on healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy, communication about the decision to use FP, and the locations of local health services that provide FP. This presentation will share the effectiveness results of the REAL scale-up phase in both regions, including findings related to IPV, VAC and FP.  </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In order to expand coverage, REAL was integrated into Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) and Youth Initiative for Employment program and Sustainable Livelihood and Development (YIELD) programs, in Karamoja and Northern Ugandan regions, respectively. The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the REAL model to improve FP and prevent IPV and VAC at larger coverage. Research questions included:</p><p></p><ul>\t<li>Can integrating a FP component into an IPV and VAC prevention intervention increase FP use?</li>\t<li>Will the program replicate the violence prevention results seen in the pilot when integrated into other programs?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>REAL was evaluated using a quasi-experimental design comparing pre and post survey outcomes among community-assigned intervention and control young fathers. A total of 600 young fathers were enrolled in the study in each region (300 intervention; 300 control in each region), totaling 1,200 enrolled young fathers. Eligibility criteria for interview participants included being between the ages of 16 to 25 years, married or cohabiting and have at least a toddler child, aged 1 – 3 years. A quantitative survey was administered to young fathers at baseline and again at endline, approximately one year later. The survey assessed primary outcomes of change in harsh physical punishment of child, IPV, and current use of modern FP, and secondary outcomes related to parenting communication and practices, couple communication, attitudes related to use of a modern method FP, and attitudes about the use of harsh physical punishment and IPV. Qualitative in-depth interviews were also conducted with a small sample of 10 young fathers and 10 young wives at baseline and endline in each of the two regions. Quantitative analysis was conducted with bivariate descriptive comparisons, followed by multivariate panel logistic regression showing adjusted odds ratios. Content analyses were conducted on qualitative data.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The presentation will focus primarily on the FP-related results, although violence prevention results will also be highlighted. Endline results in both regions show that similar to the pilot, intervention young fathers were significantly less likely to use any form of IPV and harsh punishment against children, relative to control. In regards to FP, the adjusted panel logistic regression results show that in Northern Uganda, intervention young fathers were significantly more likely to use any FP method (aOR 1.39; CI 1.07, .82; p0.05), relative to control. In Karamoja, intervention young fathers were significantly more likely to use any method of FP (aOR 2.16; CI 1.69, 2.77; p</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The findings suggest a successful scale-up of REAL Fathers in reducing IPV and VAC. However, results show mixed effects on modern FP use. For both regions, increases in modern FP use among both intervention and control suggest that increased FP use may not be entirely caused by the REAL intervention. In Karamoja, use of modern FP increased pre to post, but with low proportions. Formative research suggests that the agro pastoralist Karimojong have a long tradition of using prolonged abstinence as a form of child spacing.  Other studies in Karamoja have suggested that while demand and intent for FP methods can be increased through community interventions, stronger linkages should be made at the service delivery level to achieve significant FP uptake (IRH 2018). The improvements in couple communication outcomes are promising, suggesting that the REAL Fathers intervention had an effect on couple communication about FP methods and seeking information about FP to health workers. One limitation of this study is that only men were surveyed, and as a result, this study relies on men’s reports of FP. Future research could explore women’s reports of FP use if the REAL model were to be adapted and tested elsewhere. Overall, REAL’s integrated IPV, VAC and FP scale-up approach suggests that the integration of one FP module may improve couple communication about FP, but not necessarily modern FP uptake. Similar integrated approaches should be paired with strong service delivery linkages and platforms to achieve an improvement in FP outcomes.</p>",

      "title": "The State’s Choice, A Man’s Choice, or Her Choice?: Planning Quechua-Indigenous Families under a Legacy of Enforced Sterilisations in Peru",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Indigenous-Quechua of Andean-Peru have experienced a particularly fraught relationship with state-provided family-planning services, with an estimated 300,000+ people being coercively, and at times violently, sterilised during the period 1990-2000 as part of a national “development” campaign (Ewig,2011). Following a ‘neo-Malthusian’ discourse, the government of ex-president Fujimori encouraged health-workers to reduce the fertility of this ethnic-group, who were seen as a ‘less-desirable’ sub-section of the population, using irreversible sterilisations. Family-planning services continue to be offered free-of-charge to low-income individuals throughout the country, yet the historical legacy of abusive ‘biopower’ arguably remains (Foucault,1990), influencing people’s trust and use of the services. A recent (2015) national-campaign ‘<em>Plan your future’</em> specifically targeted the rural-poor for intervention again, and health-workers continue to receive targets of how many couples to yearly furnish with contraceptives, encouraging Quechua women to limit childbearing. However, women are also caught in a context of patriarchal ‘<em>machismo</em>’, and until 1995 women had to receive their husband’s written-permission to receive contraception (Boesten,2010). Today men often prohibit their wives use of family-planning-methods (Yon-Leau,2005). This ‘reproductive-governance’ (Morgan,2012) of indigenous-women through family-planning services affects not only women’s ability to successfully plan their family, but also influences subjectivities and the way people view families and themselves.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The research questions to be addressed in this paper are:</p><p></p>\t<li>Are there any issues with inequitable access to family planning services as in the past?</li>\t<li>What are the barriers that indigenous contraceptive-users face when accessing family-planning services?</li>\t<li>How do state provided family-planning services and the wider clinical context address gender inequality in the region and in health service use?</li><p></p><p>This paper aims to address how the health service consultations, policies, and promotional materials affect Indigenous women’s abilities to successfully chose, use, and negotiate the family-planning method(s) of their choice, to reasonably achieve the family of their choice.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study is based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork (11 months) in a rural province of the Andean department of Ayacucho, Southern Peru. The researcher lived in two rural communities to observe and participate in daily life, as part of the research requirements to complete a doctoral programme in medical anthropology.</p><p>The methodology uses participant observation in 3 national health centres in the same regional network; one small hospital, one rural health centre, and one satellite health post, and in the communities (with a focus on two). All of the clinic sites offer family planning consultations and services free-of-charge to low-income patients who have [also free] state-provided health insurance.</p><p>Within the clinics, observation was undertaken in family-planning consultations, waiting areas, and maternal-care wards. In the communities, observation was carried out at community events (e.g. International women’s day anti-violence event and independence day event(s)) and in people’s homes and everyday activities.</p><p>50 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were undertaken with women-users of the family planning services, and 5 interviews with health workers within the clinics. Further multiple unstructured interviews and informal conversations with other key stakeholders such as the leader of the indigenous women’s group and the local planning officers were also completed.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>1) The majority of health-workers in the region studied do not experience the problems in communication as previously identified as a major issue in family-planning by other researchers (Rousseau,2009). For example, almost all workers speak Quechua in addition to Spanish and therefore in theory are able to communicate during consultations in a patient’s preferred language. However, coercive practices continue in some contexts. For example, women report being detained until the acceptance of a contraceptive-method after giving birth, even though maternal-lactation could have acted as a contraceptive for the initial months, suggesting that workers are attempting to meet prescription-targets as opposed to simply encouraging child-spacing.</p><p>2) Legacies of the enforced sterilisations remain in some communities, although there is a great deal of silence surrounding this issue still. Due to this, younger women (30 and under) often are unaware, or only vaguely aware, of what happened to women in the region, and so this is less likely to affect uptake willingness and/or trust.</p><p>3) Family-planning services are directed almost exclusively at women, supporting Gutmann’s conclusion that men have been ‘planned out of family-planning’ in Latin America (2011). Whilst information-leaflets and posters in the clinics suggest that men should participate in the selection of contraceptives, they are rarely in attendance at the consultations. Women report specifically opting for certain contraceptive methods, such as the 3-month-injection, as they do not leave any ‘evidence’ and can be used without one’s husband knowing. This suggests that for some, not much has changed since the 1990’s (Boesten,2010;Yon-Leau,1995).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>1) Although worker’s qualifications may have improved, the job insecurity jobs due to short-term contracts and institutional-corruption result in pressure to achieve targets, which may encourage undesirable practices. In order to ensure that women are receiving the best care, arguably the workers need more job-security with less target-based evaluations so they are not tempted to undertake coercive-practices.</p><p>2) A lack of community acknowledgement of the past sterilisations may be a double-edged sword; on one hand, younger-women may not fear seeking family-planning services in the clinics. On the other, a lack of consensus negates support to the victims. Community workshops, following the success of past Manuela-Ramos contraception-talks for example, could be introduced to sensitively discuss and seek reconciliation for the past injustices at the community level.</p><p>3)Whilst the notion of ‘good motherhood’ for women includes planning a family with foresight, in a recent clinic campaign (2017) “<em>You are the best father</em>”, aimed at including men more in the life of the clinic and their children, family-planning advice is notable for it’s absence in the Ministry of-Health’s view on what makes a good ‘father’, suggesting that the gender inequalities of family-planning services continue at an institutional level. For women to be able to select the best contraceptive method for their circumstances, communication between partners is needed. However, the health services appear to discourage the participation of men. Therefore, more inclusive campaigns that specifically address male participation in family-planning are arguably needed so that both sexes are included in the decision making process.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Tanzania has a population of 56,877,529 (UN estimate July 2017) of which more than 60% is under the age of 25 yrs. Within Tanzanian women of reproductive age, 19.1% are between 15-24 years, while the age specific fertility rate for individuals 15-19 and 20-24 are 132 and 236 per 1000 live births respectively. 44% of young Tanzanian women become pregnant by the age of 19, and young women account for 20% of Tanzania’s maternal mortality rate, (556 per 100,000 live births). Given rapid population growth and poor outcomes related to teenage pregnancy, youth family planning is an imperative. Yet, despite national efforts, the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) among 15-19-year-olds is extremely low (8.6%), while 20-24 age group stands at 28.9%. Comparatively, the national CPR is 32 % (TDHS 2015). Condom use is similarly low, with 38% of women aged 15-19 having used a condom during their last sexual encounter (THMIS, 2012). 23% for married women ages 15-19 and 42.4% for their unmarried sexually active peers have an unmet contraceptive need. Unprotected sex among youth poses serious health implications and increases the risk of STIs, unwanted pregnancies, and maternal mortally. iPlan health insurance addresses youth’s sexual and reproductive health needs. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>UNFPA and DKT International Tanzania (DKTT) are collaborating to increase Tanzanian youth SRH by expanding DKTT’s iPlan program. iPlan is an innovative micro-insurance scheme where, for a nominal annual fee of TZS 20,000 ($10), an individual receives comprehensive SRH services for one year including four SRH/FP counseling sessions, any modern contraceptive method, condoms, and HIV/AIDS counseling and testing. iPlan targets youth 25 years and younger in urban centres serviced by DKTT’s Trust Health and Wellness Clinics (Mbeya, Mwanza, Dodoma, and Dar es Salaam). Services are delivered by DKTT’s providers. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To encourage young people to access family planning, DKTT scaled up the iPlan insurance in its three clinical locations: Mwanza, Dodoma, and Mbeya. UNFPA’s collaboration with DKTT supported the subsidization for the iPlan package to TZSH 10,000 ($5). In addition, UNFPA supported “Resource Centres” at DKTT Trust Health and Wellness Clinics and refurbished Peer Counselling Rooms in partner universities. Such spaces provided students with information and service for continuing client on short-term methods, while long-term and new clients are referred to the clinics. This strengthened partnership with local universities and foster access to students on campus. Utilized innovative and integrated “below the line” strategies that met youth where they congregated to discuss family planning. In addition, clients are registered mainly through events, social media and peer counseling rooms for referred new and long-term FP method clients. The clinics are designed like beauty parlours and this creates more attraction and provides the stigma-free environment. Services are provided quarterly to ensure a continuum of care</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>DKTT’s collaboration with UNFPA in May 2016, and implementing a targeted marketing strategy focused on directly interacting with students in youth-friendly settings, iPlan sales progressively increased between 2016– 2018. Since 2016, the iPlan sales have progressively increased and in total, 5,924 students are using the services. Simultaneously, efforts have attracted more than 12,419 young people with information on FP services, through events and media platforms. The success of iPlan further underscores the need for policy change from the current free FP service provision in the public sector as recommended in the TMA feasibility study. The average age of iPlan clients was 23.6 years old. A clear indication that students in their second and third year of the university were primary participants. 80% of iPlan clients were female, although quantifying the exact number of university students in these cities is difficult, it is estimated that Trust Clinics have sold iPlans to 4-5% of the total female university student population, and about 2.5% of the total male university student population in Tanzania. DKTT aimed to reach 2,250 youth with iPlan for the period of July 2017 to June 2018, to date, 2,293 youths have been reached. In the first quarter of 2018 alone over 1,100 iPlans were sold throughout the country. This reflects increasing demand for FP among young people who are willing to pay for services.</p><p></p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<ul>\t<li>Young people are willing to pay for SRH services if provided in a friendly affordable environment.</li>\t<li>However, young people often have less disposable income, meaning subsidization of services is an incentive for participation in programming</li>\t<li>Increased success in iPlan sales can be attributed to changes in approach, focus, and management of the iPlan program</li>\t<li>The quality of service can influence the acceptance of the total market approach</li>\t<li>Youth programming should be ‘tailor-made’ for young people and should seek to speak to youth where they are</li>\t<li>The recruitment of students and youth is easier if the individual recruiting them is of the same community and age bracket.</li>\t<li>Having institutional clinical locations provides a consistent place where young people can go to receive SRH/FP information and services in a youth-friendly environment without fear of stigma.

      "title": "Has access to family planning services improved following the implementation of national health insurance in Indonesia?",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Historically, many Indonesian women have opted to access family planning (FP) services through private sector midwives and pay out-of-pocket rather than use free or subsidized services at public primary care centers (<em>puskesmas</em>).</p><p>In 2014, Indonesia launched its national health insurance program, <em>Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional</em> or JKN, which has greatly expanded access to health care services throughout the country. Because it is not listed among the services <em>excluded</em> by the program, FP service delivery, by default, is included in JKN’s benefits package. However, BPJS-K—the payer agency for JKN—does not contract with private midwives, creating a divide between the type of FP services JKN provides and patient preference.</p><p>Inadequate coordination between BPJS-K and BKKN, the National Population and Family Planning Body, and local governments (which procure commodities) may further undermine appropriate delivery of FP services, particularly for the poor and geographically-disadvantaged communities.</p><p>Data from the Indonesia Demographic Health Survey (IDHS) indicate that progress in average modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) has plateaued generally, and even fallen slightly among married women (from 58% in 2012, before JKN, to 57% in 2017).            </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>There is a lack of literature on access to FP services since JKN was implemented in 2014, particularly on use of FP services by the insured and by disadvantaged populations. Understanding Indonesia’s experience is relevant for other countries aiming to expand access to FP services in the context of major health financing reform. Given this, our main research questions are:</p><ul>\t<li>How has family planning access changed over time (i.e., before and since JKN)?</li>\t<li>Is insurance coverage associated with higher modern contraceptive use?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>We used nationally representative household data from Indonesia’s National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas) from 2011 to 2016. On average across these years, the Susenas sample size was about 1.1 million individuals from approximately 286,368 households. Since the Susenas questionnaire only asks ever-married women questions on family planning, our analysis focused on married women. We conducted descriptive and statistical analyses using Susenas data to estimate the national contraceptive prevalence rate and method mix over time, among married women, and for:</p>\t<li>Insured versus uninsured</li>\t<li>Socioeconomic status (SES), i.e., the poor, near-poor, middle, and rich SES groups</li>\t<li>Island grouping, i.e, Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and Eastern Indonesia island groups</li><p>Analyzing data from the 2015 Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) survey in Indonesia provided additional context on where modern methods are accessed by the uninsured and insured (public facility, private facilities, or other location).</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong>Trends in mCPR</strong></p><ul>\t<li>Susenas data shows that average mCPR among married women decreased from 49.4% in 2011, before JKN, to 45% in 2016.</li>\t<li>Significant differences in average mCPR persist by island grouping since JKN. In 2016, mCPR was lowest in Eastern Indonesia (33.4%) and highest in Kalimantan (52%).</li></ul><ul>\t<li>Average mCPR was significantly higher among the uninsured (50%) compared to the insured (48.4%) in 2011 and this trend persists in 2016 (46% compared to 44%, respectively). However, the decreasing trend in mCPR was most pronounced for insured rich women; mCPR among the insured rich decreased by 17% from 2011–2016, whereas mCPR among insured poor decreased by 6%.</li></ul><p><strong>Trends in modern method mix</strong></p><ul>\t<li>In 2016, insured women used long-acting and permanent methods at higher rates (15.5% and 4.6%, respectively) compared to uninsured women (12.4% and 3.1%, respectively). Use of short-acting methods has declined among insured users since 2013, whereas it has not declined by the uninsured.</li>\t<li>Use of long-acting and permanent methods was significantly higher for the rich compared to the non-rich, however, use of long-acting methods is increasing from 2011–2016 for all populations. Use of short-acting methods is higher among non-rich groups compared to the rich, though it is decreasing from 2011–2016.</li></ul><p><strong>Modern method source</strong></p><ul>\t<li>In 2015, the insured access modern methods at public facilities at greater rates (18%) compared to the uninsured (13%). The uninsured access services at greater rates (63%) at private facilities compared to insured users (55%).</li></ul>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<ul>\t<li>Our results highlight similar decreasing mCPR as in the IDHS, indicating that FP progress has plateaued in Indonesia.</li>\t<li>Since JKN, mCPR is higher among uninsured compared to insured. Many FP users, faced with far distances to <em>puskesmas</em> and long wait times, instead access FP services in clinics through private midwives. Since BPJS-K does not contract with private midwives, this may partially explain why mCPR is lower for insured compared to uninsured women, however, more research is needed to understand which insured SES groups rely on FP access through private providers.</li>\t<li>Analyzing average mCPR by SES, we found that the mCPR decrease was larger for insured rich women compared to insured poor women. These results indicate that having JKN insurance may be more important for FP access among the insured poor compared to the insured rich.</li>\t<li>Geographical disparities remain, with mCPR lowest in the most rural island grouping, Eastern Indonesia. These geographical inequities highlight the possibility of other health systems barriers, such as lack of adequately-trained health personnel and health facilities providing a broad method mix.</li>\t<li>Short-acting methods have been most common in Indonesia over time, however, our results highlight a shift towards long-acting and permanent methods among the insured since JKN. Given that price may be a factor in women’s decision to use short-acting methods, this shift in method mix indicates that JKN may be alleviating some of the financial burden women may face when accessing long-acting and permanent methods.</li></ul>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>High levels of fertility and unwanted pregnancy persist throughout Ghana, despite five decades of policies and programs that aim to provide family planning (FP) services to its people. In the 1990s, the Navrongo Health Research Centre launched a program that dramatically reduced fertility through integrated community-based primary health care that emphasized FP in the context of life-saving maternal and child health services.  When the Navrongo approach was successfully replicated in implementation trials, its strategies were scaled up through a program known as the Community-based Health Planning and Services initiative (CHPS).   As a program that now reaches over two thirds of all communities, CHPS represents Ghana’s core program for achieving universal health coverage (UHC). </p><p>This paper reports on the fertility impact of CHPS in the context of the Ghana Essential Health Interventions Program (GEHIP).   GEHIP was a multi-district program in Upper East Region that demonstrated ways to accelerate CHPS coverage and achieve UHC by improving leadership for CHPS implementation. National projections suggest that Ghana could achieve UHC within five years if GEHIP is replicated.   Given GEHIP success in improving CHPS geographic coverage, there is a need to assess the relationship between GEHIP implementation, CHPS scale-up, and fertility levels and trends. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The GEHIP plausibility trial tested the fertility and mortality impact of strategies for accelerating CHPS coverage.  Conducted in the Upper East Region over the 2010 to 2016 period, GEHIP was associated with a five-fold increase in the population density of community-based primary health care coverage through CHPS.  Baseline and endline surveys were conducted in 66 clusters within districts exposed and unexposed to this rapid CHPS scale-up.  Population based data from these surveys permit the difference-in-differences assessment of the hypothesis that rapid achievement of UHC will achieve significant improvements in reproductive health and reduction in fertility.    </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>GEHIP was located in four districts of Ghana’s Upper East Region with seven neighboring comparison districts.  A program of interventions was launched in treatment districts to expand CHPS services to include emergency referral care, improve the quality and range of primary care services, and develop leadership for sustaining community and political engagement in the CHPS implementation process.   Monitoring operations assessed the location, timing, and content of community-based primary health care. To assess implementation impact, randomized household surveys were fielded in 66 census enumeration area clusters in intervention and comparison districts. 5,511 women of reproductive age were interviewed in the baseline survey and 5,914 women in the endline.</p><p>Multi-level spline hazard regression analysis is applied to merged baseline and endline birth history data, with provision for linking exposure to CHPS services at exact ages of mothers as GEHIP implementation and maternal parity progressed.   Results adjust for the potentially confounding effects of social and demographic characteristics of households, permitting estimation of the net effect of GEHIP, conditional on segments of maternal age that may represent contrasting responses to UHC access.   Accompanying difference in differences calculations permit estimation of the impact of UHC phase-in on unmet need, use of contraception, and fertility.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary analyses indicate that exposure to GEHIP is not associated with fertility decline, despite the increase in CHPS coverage brought about by GEHIP and increase in the prevalence of modern contraceptive use.  Multivariate hazard models estimating net effects of CHPS versus GEHIP interventions that supplemented CHPS confirm that GEHIP had no impact on total fertility although it was associated with lower fertility among women under 25. </p><p>Achievement of UHC in GEHIP areas is associated with statistically significant increases in contraceptive use, from 20.7 percent prevalence in the baseline to 26.9 percent in the endline.  In comparison areas, contraceptive use did not change over time.  Furthermore, achieving UHC under GEHIP was not associated with change in unmet need.  GEHIP had a pronounced impact on neonatal mortality, and maternal mortality ratios show that facility based care strategies of the program saved maternal lives.  While this survival impact represents a major step forward in demonstrating ways to improve the survival impact of community-based primary health care, and GEHIP impact on family planning is substantial, UHC under GEHIP has failed, so far, to result in fertility change. </p><p>Results attest to the need for UHC to be augmented with policies that promote social access to family planning.   Women who seek to space or limit childbearing face social constraints that UHC can fail to adequately address.   Geographic access to family planning is important, but insufficient.   UHC requires extra-clinical community outreach activities that support the needs of men and women for information and services that offset social barriers.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>It is widely assumed, but seldom tested, that family planning access will be addressed if UHC is instituted.  Moreover, comprehensive integration of health and family planning services is advocated, without question. If health access is universal, family planning access will be improved.    GEHIP challenges this assumption with results showing that convenient geographic access has had an only marginal fertility effect, with impact that is limited to women under age 25.  This limited impact is associated with a counter-intuitive impact on contraceptive use and preferences that is associated with no change in unmet need.  Demonstrating this result with statistically rigorous modeling, accompanied with basic portrayal of net fertility effects, will alert the policy community and donors to Ghana’s program of the need to extend investment in community-based program training and worker deployment beyond the implementation of clinic-based UHC.  Strategies for addressing the social access needs of women are essential components of the effective development of geographic access to primary care.  Social mobilization, community-outreach, connection of family planning discussions with male social networks were elements of the Navrongo family planning success story that have atrophied as CHPS has sealed-up.  Results of this research provide knowledge that successful achievement of UHC with CHPS as a primary strategy, requires careful ancillary strategies for ensuring social access to family planning.     </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Low- and lower-middle-income countries are seeking sustainable health financing to scale-up family planning (FP) programs in 69 priority countries in order to reach the goals outlined in Family Planning 2020 (<em>FP2020</em>) commitments. These discussions surround approaches to ensure that voluntary, rights-based FP is sufficiently included in insurance benefits packages and other funding mechanisms that are part of the roadmap to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Currently, no agreed-upon set of cost-effective, evidence-based, essential packages of FP services and supplies exist. Against this backdrop, the USAID-funded Health Policy Plus (HP+) project conducted a comprehensive literature review to understand the evidence available on basic and comprehensive FP benefits packages.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In this study, we sought to answer the following research questions:</p><ul>\t<li>What evidence is available in the peer-reviewed and gray literature regarding basic and comprehensive FP benefits packages?</li>\t<li>What kind of consensus can be reached among expert FP and health financing stakeholders with regards to the components of basic and comprehensive FP service packages?</li></ul><p>This analysis is suitable to inform discussions with health purchasers in a priority FP2020 country that is also engaged in health sector reforms geared toward achieving UHC. In 2017-18, we focused on Ethiopia.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We searched for peer-reviewed journal articles and grey literature published between 1990 and 2016 that defined basic and/or comprehensive FP service packages. In total, 160 papers met the inclusion criteria. These papers provided evidence for the inclusion of a service into a FP package or advocated for a certain composition of contraceptive methods (broad method mix, short-acting methods, long-acting reversible methods, or permanent methods) to be included in a FP package. We developed a scale to measure the strength of evidence for each FP package component based on the evidence available in the literature. From each paper, we extracted evidence on the specific FP services included in a minimum FP package for countries to consider including in their relevant national health insurance schemes. We documented recommended service delivery modes for these packages as discussed in the literature.</p><p>Following completion of the literature review, we used a modified Delphi methodology to inform the definition of the essential components of two FP package variants—basic and comprehensive—for purchase by UHC-oriented schemes. The Delphi method’s structured technique was used to capture recommendations by a panel of FP experts. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Evidence from the literature review reveals a focus on FP within the broader scope of sexual and reproductive health. Scarce literature presents evidence for specific components of a FP package. We found no literature on an “ideal mix” of FP services. We identified strong evidence in the literature for the inclusion of a broad contraceptive method mix (51 resources) and counseling services (70 resources) in an essential package of FP services. We found moderate evidence for the integration of FP service delivery into maternal and child health and primary healthcare services (56 resources).</p><p>Expert opinion from the Delphi sessions identified specific types of services to be included in discussions regarding basic and comprehensive FP packages in Ethiopia. The basic package recommendation included pre-acceptance counseling on a full range of methods, follow-up counseling, short-acting methods (injectables, male condoms, emergency contraception, and oral contraceptives), long-acting reversible methods (IUDs and implants), and permanent methods (female sterilization). The recommended comprehensive package of services included the methods identified in the basic package in addition to an expansion of short-acting services (vaginal rings and female condoms) and male sterilization services. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive literature review that gathers evidence on the components of a FP service package. Our results highlighted a gap in both peer-reviewed and gray literature on the essential components of a FP package that would be suitable for further discussions in Ethiopia and similar priority FP2020 countries. Much of the literature discussed FP within the broader context of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) rather than as a discrete package of services, which creates a challenge in separating FP from broader SRH services. Our mixed method approach, utilizing both a literature review and the Delphi process, allowed for surveillance of literary evidence accompanied by recommendations from FP experts. Based on our methods, we identified basic and comprehensive packages of FP services for inclusion in UHC-oriented schemes in Ethiopia. These findings can be adjusted in accordance with a country’s needs and priorities for global applicability. </p>",

      "title": "Can a mobile app for community health workers improve postpartum family planning knowledge and uptake?: Evidence for the CAS application in two states of India",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Use of non-permanent family planning methods is low in India (48% of women are using a modern method, but only 12% are using a method other than sterilization). In states like Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, where the total fertility rate is higher than India as a whole, use of modern methods other than sterilization is particularly low (Bihar: 3%; Madhya Pradesh: 7%). Past research has found that despite a high proportion of women being contacted by health providers during pregnancy and postpartum in India, few received messages about family planning, even though messaging is associated with increased uptake. It is possible that better tools for health workers to provide information could improve postpartum uptake. A mobile-phone application called Common Application Software (CAS) for frontline workers intended to digitize beneficiary enrollment, enable beneficiary tracking, and support delivery of services, is being integrated into the Integrated Child Development Services program in India. CAS designs a simple animated video explaining the benefits of family planning and includes a checklist of questions about use of spacing methods which are expected to be used during home visits to counsel all mothers with children 0-24 months on family planning methods.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The aim of this analysis is to measure the impact of CAS on knowledge and uptake of family planning methods by women in the postpartum period in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. We will also explore if exposure to the ICDS program (measured by health worker visits) pre-CAS is associated with knowledge and use of family planning. Furthermore, we will measure the impact of CAS on counselling about family planning, and related knowledge, among pregnant women. We hypothesize that CAS will increase knowledge of all women, and uptake of methods among women in the postpartum period.</p>",
      "methodology": "This study uses a repeated cross-sectional matched cohort design. We use a 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score matching method to identify 426 pairs of intervention and control villages using a set of pre-intervention village-specific characteristics from the 2011 Census. In the baseline, the study recruited 6827 women (2,480 pregnant 4,347 post-partum women) from these matched pairs of villages. The effects will be examined through a post-intervention comparison of outcomes between the intervention and control groups, controlling for potential confounders and pre-existing differences between the groups, and adjusting for the matching design. We also plan to conduct sub-group analyses to identify heterogeneity of impacts from the perspective of an equity- and gender-focused evaluation. We will also conduct a pathway analysis to look at the impact of CAS on family planning knowledge, and then on family planning uptake. In the preliminary analysis of the baseline data, we explore the association between exposure to the ICDS program (number of visits by a health worker) and current family planning knowledge and use, controlling for socio-demographics variables.",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results from the baseline survey (pre-roll out of CAS) found that between 4-7% of women reported having received advice about family planning in the postpartum period or during pregnancy from a health worker. Fifty-seven percent of women knew at least half of the correct answers to a series of questions about family planning knowledge. Twenty-four percent of women with a baby 0-6 months, 39% of women with a baby 6-12 months, and 39% of women with a baby 12-24 months were currently using a method of family planning. Of women who reported using any method, 21% were sterilized, 20% using condoms, 11% lactational amenorrhea, 33% a traditional method, 9% pills, and 5% IUDs. Family planning use, and specifically use of modern methods, was higher among women in Madhya Pradesh than Bihar. In the baseline data, having a higher level of accurate knowledge about family planning methods, having more children, being Hindu, more educated, and in a higher wealth quintile were significantly associated with increased odds of currently using family planning. Exposure to health workers was associated family planning knowledge for visits during pregnancy, not in the postpartum period.  Exposure to health workers was not associated with current family planning use among any group of women. By the time of the conference we will have end line data and be able to report on the impact of CAS on family planning knowledge and uptake.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Mobile applications for community health workers have been gaining increased attention, yet few studies have rigorously tested their impact. Currently, visits with a health worker do not seem to be associated with family planning knowledge or use in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh; however, accurate family planning knowledge is associated with higher rates of family planning use. Thus, findings ways to support community health workers in increasing women’s knowledge of family planning methods has potential for increasing uptake among postpartum women. This evaluation will help build the evidence base for (or against!) mobile methods for providing family planning information to women in the postpartum and pregnancy periods in a high need population in India. Additionally, it will provide insight into how increased knowledge may or may not lead to increased uptake of methods. Finding innovative ways to help community health workers provide information to women in the pregnancy and postpartum period about family planning has the potential to reach larger populations of women in a hard to reach time period.</p>",

      "title": "Immunization days are family health days: developing an integrated approach to providing essential health services for mothers and children in Senegal",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Nearly one in four married women in Senegal has unmet need for family planning (FP), particularly postpartum women (60% unmet need). Integration of FP and immunization services shows potential as a high-impact practice for decreasing unmet need by reaching the intended population while they are already accessing health services. In Senegal, integrated services provide an opportunity to reach most mothers; approximately 97% of children receive at least one immunization, and over 2/3 are fully vaccinated. However, attempts at integrating FP with other services have not been effective. Clients do not come to immunization services prepared to take up FP, and immunization and FP providers do not systematically talk to clients about the benefits nor refer clients to the other service. Due to perceived trade-offs between effective immunization and FP services, particularly in light of health worker shortages, Ministry of Health and Social Action (MOHSA) stakeholders may be reluctant to mandate integrated services nationally; consequently, there are no clear guidelines on integration. With Hewlett Foundation funding, ideas42 and IntraHealth International partnered with MOHSA to apply a behavioral design approach to integrating services that would be both effective and acceptable to clients, health workers, and stakeholders at district, regional, and national levels.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The project tested the effectiveness of a behavioral design process to optimize integration of immunization and FP services. The behavioral design process is a multi-phase, participatory co-creation process through which program designers work with end-users (in this case, postpartum clients and immunization and FP providers) to identify barriers to uptake in order to inform program design. This iterative process also includes multiple rounds of prototyping designs with stakeholders and user testing prototypes with end-users, thus providing a framework for systematically and intentionally incorporating feedback into the final design in order to ensure that the solution is both effective and sustainable.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We began by having extensive conversations with postpartum clients and health workers to identify behavioral barriers to FP uptake during immunization days (on the client side) and FP service provision during immunization days (on the provider side). We then worked with MOHSA officials from the directorates of immunization and FP to co-design a contextually-appropriate intervention with both demand and supply-side components to overcome these bottlenecks. We aimed to ensure that diverse stakeholder perspectives were incorporated into the design package—a system of integration they will ultimately be responsible for sustaining. We user tested these ideas with clients and health workers in the Kaolack region—observing them using our design package and gathering feedback. We then iterated on our ideas based on this feedback, keeping the parts of the design that worked and refining the parts that were less than optimal. We conducted a one-month pre-implementation test in October 2017 in 4 health posts in Kaolack to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention within the Senegalese health system context. Throughout this process, we spoke with more than 300 clients and over 60 health workers in Thies, Kaolack, Louga, and Ziguinchor regions, incorporating their feedback directly into each design iteration.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>With MOHSA, we co-designed a referral system to provide a clear mechanism for integrating the two services and which would reframe immunization services as family health services, with the aim of increasing not only FP uptake but also immunization completion rates and correct and consistent use of either exclusive or complementary breastfeeding. In this system, referral cards are given to each client with a planning prompt to select a day to speak with a provider about FP and a checklist for immunization, breastfeeding, and birth spacing. Health workers are encouraged to explain to clients that these are three important things they can do to care for their child in the first year of life and to help clients check off each one to complete the set. Research shows that grouping tasks together as a set motivates completion. To encourage clients to make a decision about FP use before immunization day, clients receive regular mobile phone stories in the form of a relatable serial drama that addresses specific client concerns about FP, gives clients mental shortcuts about when FP use is appropriate, and provides clear and actionable next steps. Health workers also receive weekly messages that provide reminders of how to address client concerns about all family health topics. Our design was shown to be feasible and acceptable to both clients and health workers during pre-implementation testing, and indicated potential for impact, with 60% of clients who received referral cards opting for a same-day conversation about FP with a health worker.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Even the most effective best practices can only be effective when consistently implemented, and buy-in from all stakeholders—from government officials to health workers to clients—is critical to ensure sustainability. In order to design an approach to integration that captures all of these perspectives, we used a specific methodology to systematically account for input along the way. Throughout this participatory process, we learned that to ensure buy-in from both the immunization and FP communities, services should be truly integrated—not just offered in the same place during the same hours. By reshaping the mental model for both clients and health workers of what immunization days are about—as a day to address child and family health holistically—both services can be strengthened. We also found that both health workers and clients face behavioral barriers to offering or taking up FP during integrated services. To be effective, interventions should include both demand and supply-side components in order to encourage clients to make an active choice about FP use that fits with their intentions of spacing births as well as to encourage health workers to provide high quality integrated services when clients are accessing health facilities. A participatory approach can strengthen buy-in from both key stakeholders and end-users and ultimately lead to a design that is acceptable to end users, effective in addressing behavioral barriers to uptake of services, and sustainable.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Timely and appropriate antenatal care plays an important role in improving maternal and child health and preventing maternal deaths. The maternal health status of Indian women was noted to be lower as compared to other developed countries. During the last one decade, the use of maternal health services has increased dramatically in India, with approximately 85% of Indian women making an antenatal care (ANC) visit during their pregnancy but the proportion declined sharply when ANC sought timely, from skilled providers, adequate (at least four visits) and appropriate (advice on complications and care).</p><p></p><p>Provision of family planning information such as methods available, possible side-effects and resumption of contraception after childbirth is an essential aspect any time a pregnant woman accesses ANC. Yet, ANC increase in use of health services has not translated into significant increases in the adoption of contraception. The appropriate ANC represents an enormous opportunity to promote the adoption of modern contraception in the country. Many studies have assessed the effectiveness of ANC on maternal and infant mortality and on their morbidity as well. But a very limited number of studies examined the role of ANC as a facilitator of family planning use.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Antenatal care seeking behaviour can increase modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR). The appropriate ANC during pregnancy could act as a successful medium for promoting woman to use modern contraceptives.</p><p></p><p>The current study aims to examine the associations between quality of ANC and mCPR in India. It seeks to answer the question of whether the mCPR after a childbirth is significantly associated with appropriate ANC. The relationships examined for the intensity of ANC services separately (independent coverage) as well as combined (conditional coverage).</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Location: India</p><p>Design: The NFHS-4 sample is a stratified two-stage sample. The 2011 census served as the sampling frame for the selection of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). PSUs were villages in rural areas and Census Enumeration Blocks (CEBs) in urban areas, selected using probability proportional to segment size sampling procedure at the first stage after the stratification. In the second stage, in every selected rural and urban PSU, 22 households were randomly selected with systematic sampling.</p><p>Data source: The present paper uses a nationally representative sample of households from NFHS-4 data.</p><p>Time frame :2015-16</p><p>Sample size: 97935 currently married women age 15-49 years with most recent live birth in two years preceding the survey date.</p><p>Analysis approach:  Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version: PASW Statistics 18). Statistical tests assumed significance at P</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Present study found that appropriate antenatal care during pregnancy is a strong predictor of modern contraceptive adoption in India, even after adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors that are known to influence contraceptive adoption. Findings indicate that most mothers (84%) had received ANC but such proportion of mothers declined (80%) when seeking ANC from skilled health providers, 58% received care that was timely (in first trimester), 50% care that was sufficient (4+ ANC visits), 31% care that was adequate (weight measurement, blood pressure check, blood test, urine test and abdomen examination at least once, two TT injections and IFA tablets consumption at least for 90 days) and only 16% received care with the appropriate (advice received on pregnancy complications, institutional delivery and family planning at least once during pregnancy) ANC. However, the conditional analysis showed that only 5% mothers (95% CI: 5.1 to 5.6) with access to services delivered by skilled health providers received appropriate ANC.</p><p></p><p>A strong association was observed between quality of ANC and mCPR. The mCPR was higher (41%) among women (95% CI: 38.5 to 42.6) who had appropriate ANC compared to women who had ANC at least once during their pregnancy (29%) (95% CI: 28.2 to 29.3). Findings from logistic regression analysis reveal that women who had appropriate ANC (skilled, timely, sufficient, adequate and appropriate) were four times more likely to use modern contraception (95% CI: 3.3-3.9) compared to those who had no ANC while controlling the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Findings suggests that policymakers and programme managers to make a strategy that increases health providers’ capacity and willingness to provide appropriate antenatal care to pregnant women during ANC visits, has the potential to substantially increase modern contraceptive use and reduce unmet need among women in India.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this study includes the large nationally representative data with wide geographical, regional and state-wise variations. The analysis of study respondents is useful, as this is a particularly important time for improving health outcomes through birth spacing. However, the limitations of this study are that the cause and effect relationships cannot be established because of the cross-sectional design and lack of information on family planning counselling given to pregnant women during each ANC visit.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Somalia remains one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world. Civilians in Somalia, enduring abuses by warring parties and dire conditions, continue to bear the brunt of the country’s long-running conflict. As a result, more than 651,000 people have been displaced since November 2016, with 18,000 residing in Mogadishu. The country is also currently in the midst of severe drought, and 6.2 million people – half the country’s population – are now facing acute food insecurity and impending famine.</p><p>This has left the country at the low extreme of global rankings on reproductive health and child indicators. One in every 12 women dies due to pregnancy related causes, and use of family planning remains dangerously low: as of 2006, only 14.6% of Somali women use a family planning method. Many women in the extended postpartum period wish to space out or limit their pregnancies but are not using a modern family planning method. Integrating family planning into routine immunization visits is an efficient solution that can result in fewer missed opportunities to provide critical services for both mother and child.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To address these needs, in January 2018, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) introduced an integrated family planning and immunization service delivery pilot across five health facilities serving internally displaced and vulnerable host populations in urban Mogadishu. In an effort to improve the quality of these integrated services and more efficiently track women and children who are due for or have defaulted services, the IRC is piloting and testing the feasibility and acceptability of using mReach, an IRC designed mobile health application and program approach.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>mReach is a mobile phone-based data platform that replaces and integrates information from existing paper-based health registers. Using Google Plus Code technology, the application provides a new and simplified way to geocode locations that do not have proper street addresses. This approach aims to support health workers to provide quality immunization and FP services by registering mother and child pairs in an initial mapping exercise using the application. Data from this exercise is used to collect a baseline estimate of postpartum family planning uptake among women in the extended postpartum period and also to auto-generate lists of children who are due for or have defaulted from immunizations services so that Community Health Workers (CHWs) can conduct immediate follow-up with clients at the community level. As CHWs engage with communities to provide immunization and FP services to patients in hard-to-reach and densely populated districts, they will be able to pinpoint and record locations to refer to when providing future follow-up services. Additionally, having a comprehensive record of areas served will allow the IRC to visualize services, using color-coded maps, to ensure equity in coverage throughout the areas supported by IRC CHWs.

      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Implementation of this pilot approach and corresponding data collection and analysis is ongoing. In fall 2018, the IRC will conduct an analysis to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using the mReach approach to: 1) introduce an integrated family planning and immunization service delivery model in an urban protracted crisis setting; 2) map family planning and immunization service coverage and equity; and 3) improve CHW’s ability to locate immunization clients lost to follow-up and their mothers and refer them back to the facility for continuation of care.</p><p>Key outcomes that will be assessed include the number and percentage of women who bring in children for immunization services and adopt a modern method of family planning; the number of new family planning acceptors; the percentage of defaulter children identified and subsequently vaccinated; the percentage of children under one years old who are fully immunized; and the percentage of mothers in the catchment population who adopted family planning as a result of integrated services.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>In urban and densely populated crisis settings like Mogadishu, it can be difficult for CHWs to track down clients lost to follow-up and encourage facility based care for services such as family planning and immunization. Seasonal movements into and out of residential areas renders tracing of clients, including those who have defaulted, difficult. Mogadishu lacks proper urban planning, further complicating efforts geared towards mapping the locations of clients. Ongoing conflict in Mogadishu limits access to some locations, complicating CHWs' efforts to conduct defaulter tracing and household visits.</p><p>This pilot provides the IRC with the opportunity to test an approach aimed at improving the way integrated family planning and immunization services are delivered in an urban crisis setting, by helping to improve CHWs’ ability to locate clients, including those lost to follow up, and refer them back to the facility for continuation of care. Pilot findings would also be highly valuable at the global level as more and more health delivery partners are searching for promising, innovative solutions to improve integrated services and identify, locate, engage and keep underserved populations within the health system.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has worked in Ethiopia since 2000 and currently supports health programming in 21 refugee camps across four regions, and local community projects across 6 regions including Beningshangul Gumuz (BGRS) region in the northwestern part of the country. Like most parts of Ethiopia, BGRS is largely rural and remote but unlike other regions, it rarely has benefitted from large multi-year maternal and child health programs run by the government and large international NGOs. Meanwhile, BGRS maternal and child indicators remain quite low – only 9.1% of women deliver in a facility, 24.5% of married women have an unmet need for family planning and coverage for pentavalent 3 vaccination is 41.7%. This low coverage of health services highlights the need for an intervention that facilitates the integration of key maternal and child health services and better engages caregivers in programming, while also addressing critical health system gaps. </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Since January 2014, the IRC has been implementing a maternal newborn and child health project in Bambasi and Assosa woredas. The project supports a multi-pronged approach to improve utilization of integrated family planning and immunization services in a timely manner, leveraging the large network of Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and Health Development Army (HDA) volunteers that work directly in the community across 114 health posts. The project also includes the design and roll-out of a cross-cutting caregiver engagement and community co-management strategy and the introduction of a complementary tool: a color-coded health calendar (CCHC).</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The <em>Enat Mastawesha</em> (the color-coded calendar) was distributed to all households with pregnant women or infants to improve understanding of the timing and purpose of critical maternal and child health services including postpartum family planning and immunization. HEWs registered pregnant women and HEWs/HDAs distributed calendars during visits, describing color-coded images and placing color-coded stickers on appointment dates to help remind families when to visit the facility. Each color represents a health service and helps demonstrate the advantages of integrated services in the postpartum period. The IRC trained HEWs directly, and facilitated HEW-led HDA trainings on improving interpersonal communication skills for effective, tailored counseling sessions. The intention was to increase the quality of home visits by making them more interactive and motivational, and support families to better health seeking behavior.</p><p>This intervention also aimed to foster ownership and ongoing feedback between communities and health posts providing immunization and reproductive health services. Each month, kebele leaders were informed of challenges. Monitoring observations were discussed at monthly meetings and serious or unresolved issues were presented at quarterly woreda meetings attended by woreda health officers and kebele leaders for further discussion and resolution.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The IRC also organized trainings for HEWs on integrated immunization and family planning services, trainings for HEWs to insert implants for the first time in the two woredas, supported the provision of FP commodities based on needs, logistics assistance, basic cold chain maintenance, and support for integrated outreaches and co-located services at the health post level.</p><p>The impact of this intervention was assessed in a formative evaluation in 2016. The proportion of postpartum women adopting a modern FP method increased in both woredas from January-December 2016, closing at 93% (of 1,752 deliveries) in Assosa and 62% (of 918 deliveries) in Bambasi with the majority of clients using implants. Pentavalent-3 coverage increased from 67% in December 2013 to 84% by December 2016 in Assosa, and from 78% in December 2013 to 93% by December 2016 in Bambasi. Measles coverage increased from 77% to 81% in Assosa and from 59% to 86% in Bambasi during the same period.</p><p>Following the formative evaluation, uptake of integrated services continued to grow.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This intervention has contributed to the improvement of integrated family planning and immunization service delivery performance in two districts of BGRS. The findings stress the value of tools that improve interpersonal communication and encourage health dialogue between mothers and fathers. They also highlight the importance of health service and system integration, follow-up mechanisms and building the capacity of lower-health level cadres to deliver basic maternal and child health services, including the provision of long-acting family planning methods.</p><p>This work may be adapted for use in other contexts including in emergency and refugee camp settings. The International Rescue Committee is currently piloting an adapted version of this approach in South Sudanese refugee camps in order to increase the uptake of postpartum family planning services.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people in Nigeria has for decades been ignored and are not addressed with the priority it requires. Almost 50 million people aged 10-24 in Nigeria face many challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health information and services; the prevalence of contraceptive use is low and unplanned pregnancies tend to result in abortions which are unsafe due to severe abortion laws. In spite of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS estimating that 60% of new HIV infections occur amongst young people and a high sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence rate of 40%, advocacy on youth sexual and reproductive health and rights issues in Nigeria is generally weak and youth participation is low. Most young people lack the skills and knowledge to engage with lawmakers on issues that affect their sexual health and rights at the national and state level. Laws and policies geared towards improving sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in Nigeria are created and adopted with very little youth participation in the development, implementation and monitoring of these laws and policies.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>In order to address the Sexual and Reproductive Health needs of adolescents and young people in Nigeria, we developed a factsheet and an instructional video- a step by step guide to conducting a successful SRH advocacy intervention in Nigeria. The tools speak to advocacy at all levels putting into consideration the religious and cultural peculiarities in parts of the country.  EVA will be sharing examples of our efforts with specific challenges and lessons learnt developing and  roll-out of the Advocating for Change for Adolescents Country Specific Toolkit, in youth-led advocacy and actual use of the toolkit to conduct advocacy to decision makers.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>EVA is implementing the Advocating for Change for Adolescents project in Nigeria and has chosen six states in Nigeria with a geographical balance to implement the project. In the states, Education as a Vaccine chose young people in the state capital who implemented project activities in communities and villages. The tools were used to carry out advocacy at the state and the national level. The target decision makers were the Ministry of Health at the national and state level, religious leaders, community leaders and other stakeholders. A total of two hundred young people were reached with the tools and they conducted face to face advocacy meetings with target decision makers.</p>",

      "title": "Advocating for Government Institutionalization of Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) in Conservative Contexts - A Case Study of Aahung's Advocacy Work in Pakistan",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The recent rape and murder of Zainab Ansari, a seven year old girl from the small town of Kasur, Pakistan has led to vigorous public debate on the rarely discussed issue of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) education and awareness, in a traditionally conservative Pakistani society. However, despite the recent public interest surrounding the issue and the consequent calls for integrating Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) within mainstream curriculum, it is important to note that there are a few organizations across the country that have been advocating for CSE integration  for several decades. Many of these projects, even after working for decades, face a challenging question: How to design a sustainable and contextually relevant CSE integration strategy into education systems while overcoming the significant socio-cultural barriers to such content? In its efforts to answer this question, Aahung, a Karachi based NGO working on SRHR education and awareness, has been using strategic advocacy approaches for collaborating with the Provincial Education Systems for incorporating CSE within the Sindh provincial curriculum.</p><p>This paper aims to present the advocacy approaches used by Aahung as a best practice model by undertaking an extensive discussion of the various strengths and challenges of these approaches.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>As the education system in Pakistan is decentralized at provincial levels, Aahung‘s advocacy interventions focus on collaborating with Provincial Education Departments. In the case of the Sindh province, Aahung worked in collaboration with the Sindh School Education and Literacy department (SELD) in order to strategically integrate its CSE curriculum into the secondary school curriculum. This collaboration resulted in the development of an integrated CSE framework which identifies potential subjects and chapters where CSE content can be incorporated. This framework ultimately resulted in the successful integration of Aahung’s CSE content into the Sindh secondary school curriculum.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To begin the process, Aahung developed a review committee in 2010 comprised of members from SELD, teachers, parents and progressive religious scholars to get the content locally approved and endorsed. In 2011, an advocacy power mapping exercise was initiated with all the provincial education departments of Pakistan. This entailed: i) understanding the operations of the education departments and decision making mechanisms, ii) identifying key stakeholders within the system, iii) building and strengthening relationships with key decision makers and stakeholders. Based on this, Aahung scaled up its advocacy efforts in the province of Sindh by conducting sensitization sessions with key decision makers on the importance of CSE integration. These sessions led to the endorsement of Aahung’s advocacy strategy and an MOU was signed between Aahung and SELD to lead the process of CSE integration. The signing of the MOU was accompanied by the establishment of a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to oversee the process of integration. The committee comprised of the heads of all sub-departments of Education and relevant subject specialists. TAC meetings were carried out with the members to review the existing provincial curriculum and develop a framework which highlights the potential subjects where Aahung’s content can be incorporated. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Following are the key findings and results from the various facets of this advocacy process:</p><ul>\t<li>A major consideration for any advocacy exercise is a nuanced understanding of the local political dynamics and its effects on the project at hand. During the power mapping exercise it was found that while the key decision makers relating to education in Sindh belong to the ruling government, the political landscape also suggests that decisions regarding sensitive issues such as CSE integration within the education curriculum also require broad-based support from other major political parties</li>\t<li>Aahung’s strategies of forming a TAC, working closely with subject specialists, and sensitizing all the personnel from various sub departments of SELD broke down resistance and increased accountability and ownership.</li>\t<li>Aahung utilized the TAC to receive expert guidance in identifying the potential subjects (Social Studies, Urdu and Sindhi) and relevant chapters from the secondary curriculum where Aahung’s CSE content could be successfully integrated. This subsequently led to the drafting of a CSE integrated framework which has informed the development of SRHR and gender sensitive content for the aforementioned subjects.</li></ul><p>The strategy of integrating CSE content across various subjects will now serve as a base to evaluate the efficacy of the framework and ultimately advocate in teaching CSE as a stand-alone subject. Aahung’s experience has shown that teaching CSE as a separate subject is a more effective methodology.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>The following implications and lessons learned are crucial for organizations working on CSE in challenging contexts:</p><ul>\t<li>The advocacy power mapping exercise helps in identifying the key players within the system and establishing and strengthening relationships with them. This, in turn, plays a crucial role in understanding and overcoming local challenges and resistance.</li>\t<li>Intra-department connectivity and networking is vital in identifying stakeholders of similar interest which could help in scaling up the intervention.</li>\t<li>Clear outlining of the roles and responsibilities of each partner and frequent meetings with key government stakeholders plays a crucial role in ensuring accountability and ownership on part of all the stakeholders.</li>\t<li>It is important to be flexible while developing public private-partnerships for such sensitive issues. This creates an environment where constructive negotiations become possible. Having said that, throughout this process Aahung has never compromised on its vision. It has always advocated integration of CSE with a ‘rights-based approach’, while being open and flexible to the concerns of other stakeholders.</li>\t<li>Appropriate integration of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) mechanisms within the intervention design is extremely important for the assessment of the overall effectiveness of the project. Advocacy is usually a slow process but in Aahung’s case it was accelerated. This highlighted that M&amp;E mechanisms need to be in place from the inception of the process in the off chance that a case like Zainab’s in Pakistan pushes the government into action.</li></ul>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>While there is growing consensus about the importance of youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services, there is still limited understanding and application of evidence-based practices to strengthen service delivery. A concrete mechanism for ensuring application of evidence-based practices to improve adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health (AYSRH) is to include those practices in national Family Planning Costed Implementation Plans (CIPs). To date, there has not been a focus among countries on ensuring CIPs adequately address AYSRH needs. However, with the expressed commitment of many countries to address young people’s SRH needs, this is an opportune time to ensure CIPs include evidence-based practices that make quality AYSRH information and services widely available to youth.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Pathfinder’s Evidence to Action (E2A) Project developed an innovative methodology for analyzing how countries’ CIPs can be improved to better address AYSRH. E2A organized conferences with donors and partners—one in May 2017 for Ouagadougou Partnership countries and another in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in August 2017. At those meetings, the methodology was pilot-tested with country teams that included ministry of health representatives, civil society organizations, and youth-leaders. Country teams learned how to use the methodology to strengthen national CIPs to better meet AYSRH needs. Youth leaders were technically prepared for their deliberations with the country teams during pre-meeting workshops.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The innovative methodology allows governments, civil society, youth and technical partners to analyze how young people’s needs are accounted for in CIPs. The methodology guides users through a step-by-step process that engages them in examining where their CIPs could better incorporate evidence-based practices to address AYSRH. Through the analysis, users arrive at visuals that represent the proportion of activities in CIPs dedicated to AYSRH, the proportion of CIP budgets dedicated to AYSRH activities, and what types of activities in the areas of demand generation, service delivery, enabling environment, and multisectoral coordination are dedicated to AYSRH. Users are guided to both identify gaps and opportunities for incorporation of evidence-based practices to ensure CIPs to better meet the needs of young people. The methodology currently uses an analytical matrix to determine how each CIP accounts for the needs of adolescents and youth.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>All nine Ouagadougou Partnership countries and DRC examined their CIPs and identified areas where evidence-based practices could be included to better address AYSRH. Use of the methodology by a team in DRC resulted in the first concrete platform for implication of young people in national decisions about family planning policymaking and programming. Use of the methodology by a team from Burkina Faso, allowed the Burkinabe participants to finalize the country’s new CIP, which now includes a considerably improved focus on youth. E2A used the methodology to examine Ouagadougou Partnership’s renewed FP2020 commitments, which shows that 11 of the 51 commitments directly address AYSRH. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>National CIPs have become critical tools for countries to transform their FP2020 and Ouagadougou Partnership commitments into concrete programs and policies. Achieving family planning goals will only be possible by addressing the needs of adolescents and youth. It is therefore important for CIPs to have a strong focus on AYSRH. Countries must follow through with their commitments by ensuring incorporation of evidence-based AYSRH practices in national policies and programs that encourage young people’s use of contraception. Technical and financial partners must work with governments to scale up these evidence-based practices to reach young people—especially in hard-to-reach and rural areas—with contraceptive information and services. Young people themselves must be involved in these efforts. E2A’s CIP analysis methodology encourages meaningful youth participation and leadership in planning for, budgeting, implementing, and evaluating SRH programs.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>A good proportion of our children enter and go through the transition to adulthood without being well informed and prepared to deal with the changes happening to their bodies; They  may look physically mature, but may not be emotionally mature . This tends to subject them to coercion, abuse and exploitation by those who take advantage of their naivety or vulnerability at this point in time. Many times they engage in risky  sexual  behavior in their own right. Uganda has one of the highest youth populations in the world, with almost a half (47.7%) of its 34.6 million people aged under 15 (UBOS, 2016). The Reproductive health of young people, especially of those who are sexually active is of greatest concern. Young people typically become sexually active, marry, and bear children early in life before they have gained capacity to nurture these families (economically, psychosocially etc.) By 15 years of age, 22.6 % of females have had sexual intercourse while the  proportion rises to 67% by 18 years (UDHS, 2011). 25% of girls below 19 years are either pregnant or already mothers (UDHS, 2016) Young women in Uganda are particularly vulnerable to consequences of early pregnancy, unsafe abortion </p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "Working with the Interreligious Council (IRC) to increase their voices among the different layers of faiths in Uganda. The IRC advocated to specifically focus on engaging their own flocks to discuss issues concerning sexuality education, their role in promoting behavioral change in respect to acceptable religious beliefs and values.Worked with Religious leaders to amplify their voices calling  for the implementation/operationalization of the sexuality education framework including continuously demanding that the ministry of education and sports through the National Curriculum Centre develops age appropriate, culturally and religious acceptable manuals/IEC and are disseminated in all schools to teach sexuality education.",
      "methodology": "<p>Regular consultation with the leadership of the Inter religious council  to review every document seeking approval from the Ministry of Education and Sports. This came as a result of  the realisation that all policies undergo scrutiny and acceptance by the IRC before any minister or even the presdient allows for their approval.</p><p>We also learnt to work with the project arm of the IRC. These people advised us how to handle the Faith leaders as well as their areas of ignorance. The advantage was that we had a public health specialist heading this wing.</p><p>Flexibility in change of language also aided our cause as we were easily flexible to agree to use softer words that mean the same things. These led to the IRC giving its approval for the Sexuality Education framework and also subsequently committing to supporting its dissemination (Especially the Anglican Church). </p><p>The other methodology was to offer reasonable facilitation to aid the movement of the the leadership of the IRC to attend meeting and also to accept to integrate our work within their  own.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The key results of the engagment with the Intereligious council of Uganda ensured that the document gained more acceptance amongst the strongest opposition groups. Uganda has lately become a conservative country where policy formulation is not exclusively based on only facts but also on sentiments and religious values of the office bearers. To get small wins at a time, we as advocates for policy change in Uganda have decided to turn our would-be oppoents into some sort of allies. During the process of advocating for the passing of the the Sexuality Education Framework to allow for the delivery of SE in schools, we constantly made efforts to engage several groups of people including those considered as opposition. The result has been that a policy has now been approved. It is worth noting that this policy may not be the best but atleast it's a basis upon which delivery of Sexuality Eduactioncan will start in Ugandan Schools. We are now strategising with the IRC Uganda to ensure that we carefully popularise this policy framework after the the launch. We will encourage the same collaboration also in the develoment of the curriculum for Sexuality Education at the different levels.The lesson here is that wide consultaions and humility towards powerful groups can supersede arguments based merely on scientifuc facts and can result into quick wins for policy advocates.</p><p></p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>The implications and lessons learnt from engagegement has been ensuring that  the Ministry of Education and Sports in Uganda to approved the Sexuality Education framework. It also resulted into a document that has been described as  culturall,socially and age appropriate.The resultant framework is also one which will not attract so much opposition from religious, political and cultural leaders since these groups have all been adequately consulted. This framework will also provide the blue print for the develoment of a curriculum and teaching of Sexuality Education in Ugandan schools and ensure that there is standardisation in what is taught to the Ugandan children.</p><p>The tedious consultation efforts exhibited by the different groups should also serve as a lesson for all thsoe involved in advocacy for the different policies that are still missing in Uganda. There is also a need to consult people that are affected dierctly by a policy such as young  people.</p><p>There is need to combine science, humility and contextual issues when engaging with different groups during policy advocacy. In a radicalised community such as Uganda, only one approach will never yield results and can only drag processes.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Use of modern contraceptives is still low in Tanzania, though it has increased from 20% in 2004-05 to 27% in 2016. The use of modern contraceptives methods differed significantly by residency, by zone, region, education and wealth. Women from rural areas, non-educated, poor and living in Western or Lake Zones have lower CPR compared to others.</p><p>Awareness on one or more modern contraceptive method is high among adolescents at 96%, but only 8.6% of 15-19 years married adolescents use modern contraceptives. Unmet need for family planning among young people who are currently married is also high at 23% among adolescents (15-19 years) and young women aged (20-24 years).</p><p>Access to adolescent friendly sexual and reproductive health services including family planning is a challenge. Studies show that only 30 percent of service delivery points in the country meet the national standards for provision of adolescent friendly sexual and reproductive health services. Access to SRH services among adolescent and young women is constrained by limited knowledge regarding their sexual and reproductive health, poor attitude of parents and guardians towards adolescent sexual and reproductive health issues, poor attitudes of reproductive health service providers, and inadequate resources for equitable delivery of adolescent friendly SRH services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>UNFPA implemented a three years project, the Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) that focused at improving the access of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) among the adolescent girls who are out of school. The project used the three holistic approaches: i) Increase the uptake of SRH and FP services by adolescent girls with a package of interventions integrated into income generation and literacy improvement; ii) Provision of income generation skills, and linking beneficiaries with micro-credit programs and iii) Improve opportunities in literacy and numeracy, to enhance adolescent girls and young women well-being. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The project operated in four wards in Kahama and Msalala district in Shinyanga region North western Tanzania. The project primary beneficiaries were the out of school adolescent girls (dropouts from primary and secondary schools, and teen mothers) between the ages of 10-19.</p><p>Quantitative and qualitative methodologies with the use of a survey questionnaire, Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), Participatory Learning and Action (PLA), and document analysis of secondary data were employed by this End line Evaluation. The quantitative approach adopted a non-randomized community intervention trial in which data from the baseline surveys in both the Intervention (Kahama district) and non-intervention/control (Kishapu district) areas were compared both at baseline and incremental achievement at end line.</p><p>The sample sizes were 322 (121 adolescents from the control arm and 201 from the intervention arm). Data analysis was done using SPSS and excel. Differences between proportions were assessed using the Chi Square test, while differences between means were assessed using the two-sample t-test, significance being at p= or </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "\t<li>On Adolescents’ Access to and Utilization of Reproductive Health Services</li><p>The intervention was associated with postponement of first sex (never had sex), no sexual partner in the past 6 months, and use of contraception. Girls in the intervention area also reported increased ideal age for marriage to 20-24 years and 25 years plus, preferred age at first birth 21 years versus 19 in the comparison area, increased birth interval to 2 year and were less likely to be pregnant. They also reported to have talked to someone about puberty (DD=23.4) and the persons they talked to included Health workers, sisters and other sources. They also reported that it was easy to obtain SRH information 72% versus 59% mainly from internet based discussion forums.</p>\t<li>On Adolescents’ Involvement in Income Generating Activities</li><p>Adolescent girls in the Intervention area, reported a significant increase in the rate of knowing how to read and write, acquiring vocational training,  having worked for pay in the last 6 months, and having been involved in agriculture as opposed to their counterparts in the control area of Kishapu. A significant proportion of adolescents reported to be economically independent.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Adolescent and young women are experiencing challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health services due to health system related as well as social and economic factors.</p><p>The project has demonstrated that access to sexual and reproductive health for adolescent and young women can be increased though approaches that include building capacity of health services providers; mobilization of peer educators that are linked  with adolescent friendly health facilities and able to provide family planning services.</p><p>It is important to enable adolescent and young mothers who have dropped out of formal education with means to support themselves and their children through provision of vocational and income generation skills and linking them with micro-credit programs. Also, the project has shown that provision of alternative education to adolescent mothers by enrolling them to tailor made courses improves their literacy and numeracy skills that enhance their well-being and increase their opportunity to lead productive lives.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has affected 13.1 million people. Within this context Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) and family planning services, delivery and prevention of HIV/AIDS become a critical health issue because of the vulnerability of the affected population. With 4.1 million of internally displaced people, the DRC is the most affected country in Africa; 132 armed groups are active.The study aims to document the extent to which adolescents and young girls living in the humanitarian context have access to SRH and family planning services assessing the level of information they receive, identifying barriers countered in the search for information, identifying risky practices at risk; and appreciating youth friendly services. The above figures correspond to 524,000 pregnant women in need of assistance, among which 78600 are exposed to risk of maternal mortality due to complications during child birth. In addition, 55,000 women and girls exposed to sexual violence and other forms of violence need assistance and protection; while 209,600 adolescents could contract sexually transmitted diseases (STI) including HIV/AID. According to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS, 2010-2011), 11% of women had sex before their 15th birthday; while adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 contributed 10% to overall fertility.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The study aimed to document the extent to which adolescents and young girls living in the internal displaced persons camps in humanitarian context have access to SRH services assess their level of information, identify barriers countered in the search for information, identify risky practices; appreciate the availability of youth friendly services including the use of contraception among women and adolescent girls. The study documented the extent to which adolescent girls living in humanitarian contexts (internally displaced) are vulnerable when they have no access to tailored SRH integrated and family planning services. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Quantitative and qualitative data were collected reaching 980 adolescent young girls aged 10 to 24 years living in camps and host families in Goma and Rutshuru regions in eastern DRC</p><p>This study is based on quantitative and qualitative data collected through two materials focusing on the frequently asked questions (FAQ) by adolescents and young people during the sensitization campaigns in their environment: an individual questionnaire and a hybrid grid. </p><p>The questionnaire was administered to internally displaced adolescents and young girls living in IDP camps and host families in Goma and Rutshuru regions in eastern DRC</p><p>We conducted a survey targeting 980 adolescent young girls aged 10 to 24 years. Facilitators were recruited and trained in administering the questionnaire.</p><p>A hybrid grid was designed and used as a guide to interview health facility officials on their perceptions about the functionality of health centers regarding the supply and demand for integrated SRH services.</p><p>A database mask was designed under OnaCollect. The data were encoded by smart-phone, compiled online by OnaCollect and exported from Excel to SPSS for processing. The results were presented in tables of frequencies without referring to the in-depth statistical tests.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>20,5% girls are <em>\"very knowledgeable”, </em>25.6% were not consistent in condom use, 64.8% never shared with new sexual partners about HIV, and 34.8% did not know where to get appropriate information. Barriers include shame (27.4%), language (25.8%).</p><p>Low level of information among adolescent girls, only 30.5% of adolescent girls are <em>“globally informed”</em> about family planning and HIV/AIDS, while 20% were <em>\"misinformed\".</em> Regarding STIs, only 17.8% are <em>\"very knowledgeable\"</em> and less than half (47.6%) of them receive information from health providers, 20% from a local organization. Other needs expressed by adolescents include how to access treatment (25.2%), what are AIDS and STIs symptoms (12.1%), and how to deal with insurance and legal issues (6.8%).</p><p>64.8% of adolescent girls declared they never shared with new sexual partners about HIV / STIs and related risks; 25.6% stop using condom with new sexual partners after only one week, although 9/10, (93.0%) among them declared they feared becoming pregnant and or contracting HIV.</p><p>Concerning the general population, DHS indicates that 18% of adolescents aged (15-19) and 19% of girls and 17% of boys (20-24years) had sexual relations before the age of 15 years. Sexual relations are usually unprotected as very few adolescents use condoms. In fact, according to the same DHS only 12,5% of adolescents girls and 21,5% of adolescent boys used condoms during high risk sexual encounters. The prevalence of STIs is 11.7% in girls and 9.2 in boys, The reasons for unprotected sex include poverty, peer pressure, media, “fashion”, misinformation, curiosity among others</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The level of information is relatively low among adolescents and young girls living in Goma and the neighboring area HIV/STI and sexual and reproductive health. It is urgent to implement interventions that focus on the types of barriers faced by girls in the quest for information at all levels such as socio-psychological (shame), linguistic (lack of clarity, low use of everyday language to explain scientific concepts, and pedagogical (lack of adequate communication support). In addition, appropriate information on the treatment of HIV/AIDS and STIs should be reinforced. Programs to be implemented in the region should take into account the perceptions of adolescents and youth about what they see as priorities. Hence, the numerous identified risky practices of adolescent and girls in relation to HIV/AIDS and STIs increase their vulnerability in the complex humanitarian context of conflict. This risk is aggravated by the persistence of violence that significantly reduces the ability of  girls to have control on their sexuality with regard to condom use or unwanted pregnancies. There is a strong need to push on the integration process of FP/SHR services within health facilities accessible for young girls. In Goma region, the study shows that it is imperative and urgent that UNFPA implements specific programs in provinces affected by internal displacement targeting the acquisition of practical knowledge, peer education, SRH services for adolescents, counseling and testing. When adolescents dispose with appropriate information and other related materials they need to protect themselves, they are able to take care of their sexual and reproductive.</p>",

One of such challenges is unintended pregnancy, which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has identified as a crucial reproductive health issue in crisis situations. Contraceptives has numerous health benefits for young refugee women because it is a first line of defense in protecting against maternal ill health in conflict-affected settings, where resources are often scarce and adequate access to health care may not be available. Nigerian young people living at the internally displaced persons camps across Nigeria like their peers elsewhere require information, education and communication on contraceptives, sexuality, body changes, gender and psychosocial development. They are usually left in the dark thereby developing wrong attitudes, misconceptions and having very poor knowedge about contraceptives. Providing CSE is not only a public health priority but a human right issue . Young people freedom and right to self-determination, access to information and health services is enshrined in various international agreements and conventions signed by the Nigerian government. Youths whether in humanitarian settings or not should have sex education.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Youth Action Movement(YAM); The youth volunteering arm of The Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (PPFN) got grant from the International Planned Parenthood Federation Africa region (IPPFAR) to improve the knowledge, attitude and perceptions about contraceptives for young people aged 10-24 living at 3 IDP camps in Borno State, Nigeria, through Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) by the use of solar powered portable audio devices with memory cards containing pre-recorded audio messages on a range of topics from contraceptives education to HIV/AIDS education to Gender Equality over a period of 9 months.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Methodology Program/Best Practice: YAM utilized a pre and posttest design. The program empowered young people aged 10-24 years living at these humanitarian settings with CSE through the use of pre-recorded audio messages in their local language; Hausa (as communication in English is a challenge for them) . 60 portable audio devices was distributed to the head teachers at 7 schools across 3 IDP camps in Borno State Nigeria, they were distributed along with memory cards that contained 45 Pre-recorded CSE lectures, dramas and songs in Hausa Language. Throughout the duration this program lasted, the students listened to different CSE lectures playing from the portable audio devices during the weekly session. Our youth volunteers who acted as moderators along with the teachers were on hand every Monday to help operate the Audio devices, they also answered questions from the students on the topic they have been educated on. 2130 young people were beneficiaries of this program and 1980 of them were interviewed at the baseline while 1859 participated in the endline survey. Data from the survey was age and sex disaggregated, McNemar’s test was used to determine equality between pre- and post-intervention levels of knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions related to contraception.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>A response rate of 92.9% and 87.3% was achieved during the baseline and endline surveys respectively. 62% of the respondents during the baseline and 57% of the respondents at the the end line survey were females. At the baseline survey before the CSE intervention was carried out, just 32% of male respondents and 26% of female respondents had knowledge of modern contraceptive methods, yet 49% of all respondents admitted they were sexually active and 91% of all sexually active female respondents admitted to having unprotected sex during their last sex at the camp. 77.9% of all respondents had misperceptions about its safety, believing that contraceptives are dangerous and that chemicals in contraceptives can damage their reproductive system. Such beliefs have resulted in the low use of contraceptives and many unintended pregnancies (47.2 % of all respondents aged 15-24 have had unintended pregnancies in the past years) which have caused some of the girls to drop out of school. These baseline data helped us in creating evidenced based CSE intervention. At the end of the 9 month intervention the endline data acted as an evidence that the intervention was successful as 86% of endline respondents had knowledge of 4 different modern contraceptive apart from condoms, 57% of male respondents used condom at their last sex while 23% of female respondents were currently on birth control pills which were made available to them by PPFN the mother organization. 11.3% of all respondents still had misconceptions about contraceptives at the endline survey.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The findings confirmed the low level of contraceptive knowledge and attitudes and perceptions related to contraception among displaced young people in humanitarian settings This program also revealed the low use of contraceptives at last sex by many young refugees despite a high prevalence of sexual practices in the camp. The low use of contraceptives among these refugee youths provides an explanation for the high prevalence of unintended pregnancies, as was earlier reported by the UNHCR16. This was evidenced again by the high rate of teenage/unwanted pregnancies at the camps among girls aged 15-24 years. Innovation and entertainment were key parts of this program as we made used of audio devices that helped us combat the problem of low manpower to teach over 2000 young people about CSE and fun activities like songs and dramas to drive home our teachings.This program was implemented by youths volunteers of PPFN which made the young people at the camps comfortable talking about their sexual habit during the baseline and endliine survey, for future replication of this program at other humanitarian settings ; future implementers should allow young people knowledgeable in the field of SRHR take ownership of the implementation of interventions just as PPFN did. Again this program goes on to underscore the fact that CSE is a cost effective measure of addressing adolescent RH problems especially unwanted pregnancies. Nigeria haven taken a step in developing guidelines and should move to the next laudable phase of implementation.</p>",

      "title": "We Hear You - A Sign Language Glossary on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights for people with hearing disability",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>In Sri Lanka about 1.6 million, 8% of the population, were regarded as disabled in 2012. The main causes for disability in Sri Lanka are poor hygiene, lack of medical care, the prevalence of 30 years of war, the aftereffects of the 2004 tsunami, and an increase in accidents. Imporatntly, about 96% of the total disabled population with functional difficulties didn't engage in educational activities. Only about 54,311 disabled students attend school. Out of the total disable population, an estimate of 389,677 people are considered to be with hearing disabilities. People with disabilities in Sri Lanka typically face significant stigma and discrimination. Particulalrly people with hearing disabilities have been marginalized and have less access to information and services on their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). They are challenged with finding ways of effectively communicating to realize their sexual and reproductive rights as they have to rely on sign language to communicate. However the Sri Lankan sign language lack proper signs for SRHR terms hence has created greater challenges for people with hearing disability access accurate information, access quality family planning and reproductive health services and exercise their equal rights.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The objectives of the \"We Hear You\" project were to bridge the communication gap faced by them by developing a sign language glossary and identifying ways of using the glossary to improve the access to accurate SRH information and SRH services of people with hearing disabilities, particulary young women and girls as they face further discrimination due to patriarchal structural barriers prevailing in Sri Lankan society.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>A national consultation was conducted to identify the specific barriers faced by people with hearing disabilities (PLHD). A group of 70 young PLHD attended; 47 males and 23 females. All these young people were members of the Sri Lanka Central Federation for Deaf who were partners of this project. A professionally trained interpreter was used for effective communication purposes. Then a survey and focused group discussions were conducted with the Sri Lanka Central Federation for the Deaf and National Deaf School to identify broader communication challenges faced by the community and their proposed solutions. A proposal was developed and presented to the 'National Council for Persons with Disabilities' for approval. A discussion was held with Ministry of Social services and they came on board as official government partner endorsin the project implementation. 10 sign language interpreters were trained on family planning and SRHR. A multi-stakeholder expert panel was appointed including trained sign language interpreters and young people with hearing disabilities, to develop signs on SRHR and finalize the glossary as a publication. Endorsements and approvals were received for the glossary from government stakeholders and was launched on the International Day of Disabled Persons under the patronage of the Hon. Minister.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>At the initial consultation with 70 young PLHD, 18.0% knew more than three contraceptives, while 42% knew two contraceptives. But only 12% knew how to use at least one contraceptive properly. 30 (63.8%) males and 18 (78.2%) females knew the difference between HIV and AIDS. 25 (53.1%) males knew that through using a condom, they can be protected from HIV where as only 8 (34.7%) females knew that. About one fifth of this group knew places to buy contraceptives, while condom being the most accessible of all the contraceptives. Identified barriers for receiving accurate information were weak communication, lack of available information and stigma in health service centers. The main output of the project was publishing a Sign Language Glossary on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights containing 234 new signs. The multi stakeholder expert panel which included youth, youth with disability, sign language interpreters, government officials, representatives from UN agencies were able to expand their networks through the project. Using the glossary, 20 sign language interpreters were trained in a Training of Trainers programme on SRHR to enhance skills and develop attitudes. Around 140 stakeholders from Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Youth Affairs, Ministry of Child Development and Women Affairs, Department of National Languages, National Institute of Education, Principals and teachers from deaf schools and Members of Police forces were sensitized using the glossary. Deaf schools, several government health clinics are using the glossary when teaching and service delivery. </p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Presently, the glossary has been used by three government institutions and one deaf school providing services and information on SRHR for people with hearing disability. Officers in charge of these institutes need further capacity building to properly use the glossary and also to change their attitudes and perceptions on people with disabilities. There's a demand to publish more copies of the glossary and to develop a video module on the signs given in the glossary to make it further accessible. An ongoing monitoring system is required to measure the effective use of the glossary and provide recommendations to improve and update it over time. British Council Sri Lanka joined Youth Advocacy Network Sri Lanka to implement a pilot project in Deaf School in Ratmalana to use the sign language glossary to start a SRHR curriculum for adolescent girls attending the school. On the other hand, ripple effects of the project has contributed to significant policy changes. Ministry has now submitted a draft bill and the Cabinet has approved to recognize sign language as an official language in Sri Lanka. Official recognition of sign language will allow a deaf person's access to education and have government services delivered to them without discrimination. This will legally enable the deaf children of Sri Lanka to have the right to an equal education and with the use of the glossary on SRHR, young people with hearing disabilities will be able to access accurate information and have agency to make informed decisions.</p>",

      "title": "Integrated family planning and immunization outreach clinics in Malawi: Data Quality Assessments as a means to improve program service delivery",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Offering family planning (FP) information and services to women in the extended postpartum period during routine immunization contacts is identified as a promising high impact practice in FP by a technical advisory group of international experts. With funding from Pfizer, Save the Children piloted integrated delivery of FP by Community Health Workers, called Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), into routine immunization outreach clinics in hard to reach remote areas in three districts of Malawi.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring the quality of reported data in public health systems is dependent on data management and reporting systems. Strengthening a health system requires key functional components at all levels of a system—from service delivery point to data aggregation, reporting and analysis. The project developed an integrated FP and Immunization package and has trained HSAs to offer injectables, pills, and condoms during routine clinics and refer for long acting reversible contraception and permanent methods. In addition to training in service delivery and patient flow, HSAs are trained in documentation of data in registers. Data quality assessments (DQA) were conducted beginning four months after implementation to determine the status of data quality at any given time and the opportunity to develop and implement strategies to address existing gaps.  </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p> DQAs, conducted in project facilities, include review of data using a standard tool, followed by immediate feedback meetings to discuss strengths and weaknesses in collecting, managing, analyzing, reporting and storing data. Improvement mechanisms were integrated through multiple feedback loops over the course of the DQA visits. Action plans were developed followed by quarterly district review meetings, indicating the importance of complete data and of quality service provision. Review meetings discussed success strategies at the community level. Each subsequent DQA began with a review of prior action items, thus ensuring continuity in problem solving and a reduction of errors over time. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Quantitative method were used to conduct four rounds of DQA to review Pfizer-funded family planning/immunization M&amp;E system between January 2016 and February 2017 across the 24 project routine outreach clinics in the three project districts. DQA teams consisted of SC and staff from the district health office. Outreach clinics were purposively selected and a data verification exercise was conducted that traced selected indicators through the reporting system.  An adapted version of MEASURE Evaluation’s Expanded DQA Tool, Version 2012 was used for quantitative data collection and analysis of project register data reported the quarter previous to the DQA visit. Indicators were checked for the following data quality dimensions: completeness, timeliness, integrity, validity, and precision. In addition to comparison and verification of data in the register versus that in the reporting forms, meetings were held with service providers and feedback was provided at the end of the exercise to identify strategies to improve data collection process and develop action plans. Quarterly district review meetings were held where DQA results were discussed. DQA sessions were cumulative, so gaps identified during the first visit were expected to be reported on during subsequent visits.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>100% of the outreach clinics received a DQA visit, 25% (6/24) received four visits, 58.3% (14/24) received three visits, and 16.7% (4/24) received two visits. Data completeness improved in the clinics with the highest number of discrepancies, a 30% margin of error was recorded during the first DQA compared to less than 5% at the fourth visit. The data verification process identified gaps in completeness and consistency.  Incomplete data, over and underreporting, and improper filing and storage of reports and registers were most common. Comparing results across the DQA visits show improvement in parameters checked. During the first DQA 70% had incomplete reports and 75% over reported numbers. Results from the second and third DQAs show that among those same outreach clinics 35% had incomplete reports in second DQA and 25% in third. While 50% over reported figures in second DQA that figure dropped to 35% in the third DQA. Proper storage of registers and reports was a universal problem, 80% of the facilities were identified as having no filing system during the first DQA compared to 20% during the second visit and during the third DQA all had a filling system in place. Chavala Health Facility performed poorly during the initial DQA and when their findings were presented during the district review meeting they received negative feedback. After the review meeting the team made efforts to address the gaps identified. Within a period of three months increases were registered in FP users as well as in immunization coverage rates.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The use of DQAs, action plans, and review meetings were a successful means of improving project data reported and service provision in this project pilot in Malawi. Onsite feedback, provided immediately after the DQA, allows for an immediate response to any data management challenges the team might face. Action plans are then developed and agreed upon with all team members together. District review meetings were a particularly successful venue for sharing learning across facilities and outreach clinics while also motivating providers to improve. These meetings increased support to improve data management and enhanced learning and experience sharing among providers. Attendance at district review meetings included representatives from the district health office, heath facility, and HSAs, which ensured buy in and support at all levels of the health system.</p><p></p><p>Follow up DQA visits should focus on reviewing progress on action points agreed upon in previous DQAs. Review of previous visit findings and action points can also be used to determine if there are any emerging issues. The use of a standardized tool is important to guide the process. Involvement of MOH staff in the process increased the value of the DQA as providers saw this exercise as part of a government effort, creating a sense of commitment. While some providers felt the frequency of the DQA was too much, the intention is for the assessments to be conducted frequently to increase the ability of program staff to use data for decision-making.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>For over four decades, UNFPA has been supporting countries to collect and use their data to make informed decisions on where best to invest their efforts to drive development, yet challenges remain for family planning programmes, particularly in addressing inequities. Data for contraceptive dynamics analysis are usually collected via household surveys; however, sample limitations generally allow for data disaggregation only at regional level. A challenge for programming is estimation of key family planning indicators at a lower administrative level, which is critical for decision-making. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This research project developed a small area estimation (SAE) method to strengthen the national capacity for production and dissemination of quality disaggregated data on family planning-related indicators (SDG 3.7.1) to better identify the districts where the need for family planning support is greatest, and to develop targeted strategies for family planning programmes.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Logistic regression models were developed to use 2011 Population Census and 2011 Demographic and Health Survey data and to estimate key family planning indicators at district level, and to identify priority districts based on the results. To take into account the influence by the characteristics of various geographic areas, 13 sub-regional models were applied. Comparing to the national level model, sub-regional models show an improved accuracy level, suggesting an overall 70% accuracy for contraceptive use prediction, and 75% accuracy for unmet need prediction. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Three indicators, contraceptive prevalence rate (all and modern methods), unmet need for contraception rate, and proportion of demand for contraception satisfied, are estimated at district level in Nepal and presented in relative and absolute terms. GIS mapping is used to illustrate geographic disparities at district level. Twenty priority districts based on percentage of women married or in union using the three indicators, and twenty priority districts based on absolute number of women married or in union with unmet need for contraception are identified.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The value of disaggregated data at lower administrative levels is demonstrated, and how they can be used for evidence-based advocacy for family planning policy and programme development. Involving Government ministries and municipalities in Nepal ensures strong ownership of data and results. This example could be replicated in other countries to ensure family planning interventions are better targeted thus reducing inequities and making best use of limited resources.</p>",

Yet, just 34.5% of unmarried adolescents and 13.3% of married adolescents use contraception, with 23% of girls reporting an unmet need for family planning.1 In Tanzania, family planning is considered appropriate only for married women with children.</p><p>Girls need it to be easier to lead healthy lives and plan the families and futures that they want, but the messages they receive about contraception are not relevant and don’t resonate. Most adolescents do not consider contraceptives to be ‘for them’ because they don’t consider themselves at risk of pregnancy, aren’t married (74% of girls have never been married1), and aren’t planning a family. Contraception must be repositioned, and the new narrative around contraception must align with girls’ priorities.</p><p> “Adolescents” are not a homogenous group. Between ages 15-19, girls undergo significant change, making it critical to understand how adolescents in this age group are different from one another based on critical developmental and life-stage factors. Segmenting adolescents in this age group is critical to ensure that the messages they receive are relevant and appropriate for their age and developmental stage.</p><p>1 DHS 2015</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Qualitative insight gathering and a quantitative segmentation study was conducted to better understand adolescent girls’ lives, their contexts and how contraception fits or could potentially fit into their lives. Identifying specific segments of girls would allow PSI to craft narratives and learning and service delivery experiences that cater to their individual priorities. The quantitative segmentation included a typing tool to help identify segment belonging to deliver targeted messages in one-on-one counseling and referrals. The segmentation also helped determine activity mix based on the size of each segment per region and determining media strategy based on media usage per segment.</p>",

Collaborative synthesis of the qualitative insights and incremental learning from prototyping helped determine two segments with distinct characteristics and personal priorities. A quantitative cross-sectional survey was implemented through in person interviews lasting approximately 60 minutes conducted by female interviewers. A self-weighted sample of 1132 adolescent females aged 15-19 resulted by using probability proportional to size multi-stage cluster sampling, distributed over ten districts in five regions, both urban and rural settings.  Analysis was divided into descriptive/profiling and predictive modeling. Profiling identified observable characteristics (e.g. tribe, religion, age, marital status) that are significant predictors of key health outcomes and/or membership of a segment. Predictive modeling analysis using latent variable modeling and machine learning algorithms was used to recognize patterns to predict segments. Data was used to develop a “typing tool” to use observable characteristics to classify girls and predict behaviors correlated with contraceptive use.  </p><p>PSI then used the results of the segmentation analyses and insights to craft bespoke messaging and experiences for the two priority segments.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Qualitative insights resulted in two segments, and quantitative segmentation done in partnership with Catalyst Behavioral Sciences, identified four segments. Age is a distinguishing characteristic between segments in both approaches, with risk for pregnancy (i.e. sexually active) as an additional prominent characteristic in the segmentation study approach. Two priority segments were identified due to their immediate risk of unplanned pregnancy.</p><p>The first segment, ‘Farida,’ is a younger adolescent (mean age 16.9) who has little knowledge about puberty, sex or contraception. For example, she may not know that first menses indicates she can get pregnant. Farida is likely to be sexually active, but her immediate concerns revolve around navigating the social, emotional and physical changes she experiences. The second segment ‘Bahati,’ is older (mean age 18.2) and more knowledgeable, but receives scary and inconsistent information about contraception and reproductive health. She knows what contraception is but doesn't consider contraception to be for her. She can’t plan ahead for her future or her family, and she doesn't see how contraception can help her.</p><p>We crafted targeted messages and experiences for each segment. Farida’s is a clinic-based learning and service-delivery experience using menarche and puberty as an entry-point to discussing contraception with girls and offering discreet, judgement free services on-site. Farida’s parents are also engaged to build support for her participation. Bahati’s is a community-based experience using Kuwa Mjanja branded pop-up events to inspire girls to dream, help them discover what’s possible, and take action through accessing girl-friendly health providers and contraceptive services on-site.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The segmentation analyses impacted the message and program design in many ways. Understanding degrees of agency and responsibility helped to determine that reaching Farida will also require reaching parents, while when reaching Bahati, parents are less important. Likewise, Farida needs reassurance and relationship-building with providers, while Bahati needs practical information and a clear connection between contraception and her goals.</p><p>PSI is developing digital job aids to help community educators better target messages and referrals to clients. The segmentation typing tool is built into the digital job aid as a fun personality quiz. This allows us to identify the client’s segment and automatically directs her to messaging specific for either Farida or Bahati. The tool takes her through guided messaging including videos, quizzes, games and referral to segment-specific activities.</p><p>Currently, age serves as a proxy for segment as the results of the analyses are applied programmatically, but the introduction of the typing tool will allow for the program to be able to determine segment type of anyone who interacts with a community educator. Likewise, 3 client exit surveys per year, including both typing and satisfaction questions, will determine how effective targeting is and gather client feedback, including satisfaction and resonance of the message. This will enable the program to continue to keep messages relevant to the clients, recognizing that adolescence is a period of rapid change, and a girl may move into a new segment very quickly due to changing circumstances in her life. </p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>In last 10 years, Rwanda has made significant improvement regarding maternal and child health and this include a significant increase of mCPR from 10% in 2005 to 48% in 2015.</p><p>Due to the lack of specific tool to set the target, Rwanda had set an ambitious target to achieve a mCPR of 72% by June 2018.  This was based on a the assumption of a linear continuation of the trend observed from 2005 to 2010 as reported by the 2010 DHS.</p><p>However, the pace of change has not held steady over recent years. While the mCPR increased by 4 times from 2005 to 2010, we observed only an increase of less than 10% from 2010 to 2015. This is consistent with the S-curve pattern seen in other countries that once a certain level of contraceptive prevalence is reached, additional increases are more difficult to achieve.</p><p>As Rwanda is developing its FP/ASRH strategic plans, there is a strong need to set a reasonable targets and prioritize key interventions for the next 7 years. This article aims to describe the process of using FP goals model to set the targets for next years and prioritize interventions to be implemented.</p>",
      "advocacyInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Over the past year Rwanda has engaged in a data-driven participatory process to develop a new Family Planning and Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (FP-ASRH) strategic plan.  The process included stakeholder interviews/assessments, secondary analysis of family planning survey data and prioritization of interventions via FP Goals.</p><p>FP Goals is a relatively new strategic prioritization tool.  It allows policy makers to set realistic goals and prioritize among broad sets of family planning interventions for an effective FP strategy. As FP2020 moves towards its final years improved strategic planning processes are increasingly important to assure that momentum continues.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Over the past year Rwanda has engaged in a data-driven participatory process to develop a new Family Planning and Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (FP-ASRH) strategic plan.  The process included stakeholder interviews/assessments, secondary analysis of family planning survey data and prioritization of interventions via FP Goals. The FP technical working group was first introduced to the FP goal tool in a plenary meeting.  Next a technical working group gathered baseline data on a broad range of survey based, HMIS and DHIS-2 data including numbers and varieties of service delivery points offering services, availability of commodities, coverage of communications channels (both general and adolescent focused), coverage of postpartum FP interventions, etc.  A second meeting was held to validate the baseline data and develop scenarios establishing relative effectiveness of interventions and realistic targets for the plan.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Via different scenarios the FP goals model helped understand the following questions: What growth is realistic in the next 5 years?  what would be our mCPR goal?  and what strategies and interventions can get us to our goal?.</p><p>If all potential strategies are scaled up, except CBD and New Method: we should expect an  overall 14.4% total increase which means an annual increase of 2.9% of CPR.  In general FP Goals found this relative ranking of the top six interventions (potential attributable increase across five years in parentheses):  Postpartum Family Planning (5.5%), Community Based Distribution (3.5%), Introduction of new method (3.5%), Interpersonal communication (3%), Comprehensive Community communication (3%), Improved FP availability (3%).  Interventions such as mass media, married youth, addressing stock outs, outreach, PAC and pharmacy expansion were all less than 2%.  The second meeting was particularly important as it pressure-tested the results.  For example, although expansion of community based approaches fared well in FP Goals, but its potential impact was actually disparaged in the meeting because past efforts to increase use in Rwanda via community health workers had led to source switching rather than mCPR growth.  Finally after a draft version of the FP-ASRH strategy had been prepared a second focused validation was conducted within the Maternal Child Health TWG.  The focused validation assured that the results of FP Goals remained consistent as the year long process of strategy development came reached finalization.</p>",
      "policyProgramImplicationsLessons": "<p>Policy projection tools such as FP Goals are useful.  However, their utility depends on their being integrated into a collaborative and iterative process where its results have a destination determined in advance of initiation.  In Rwanda FP Goals was identified as a tool useful for the FP/ASRH strategy development (i.e., it was not a tool looking for an application). The FP goals model showed us how the previous strategic plan had too ambitious targets and the projections were based on the business as usual of growth mCPR without taking into account that once a certain level of contraceptive prevalence is reached, additional increases are more difficult to achieve.</p><p>FP goals demonstrated that Rwanda will need to address not only the supply side issues of commodities, logistics and data quality improvement but also focus on developing strategies for reaching new users, such as postpartum women, unmarried women, sexually active adolescents and young adults as well as decreasing discontinuation in order to maintain the accelerated pace of contraceptive uptake.</p><p>For now PPFP is now considered as a high priority for the country to increase the mCPR and this a good opportunity as for now  99% of Rwandan women attend at least one ANC and 91% deliver in health  facility.</p><p>Insufficient disaggregated data currently available at district level was a challenge in using FP goals model especially in District prioritization</p>",

      "title": "Using modeled population data with family planning consumption to improve targeting and distribution of family planning commodities: the case of Nigeria  ",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Current planning for distribution of family planning commodities is based on past orders (consumption data) to inform where commodity is needed. This method is reactive and assumes that order information is a true reflection of the demand for family planning. Until recently, order information was the only timely information readily available for making distribution decisions at the facility level. There is now the opportunity to complement order data with disaggregated population and demographic data to improve targeting and assess the distribution of family planning commodities. By using detailed modeled population data from World Pop (www.worldpop.org.uk) and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program (www.dhsprogram.com) along with consumption data, it is possible to identify potential demand for family planning to a greater level of detail. Findings can then be used to identify areas where supply is well positioned and where it is misaligned. Such an analysis is both useful to family planning programs for targeting actions and for the supply chain to more effectively position commodities and reduce risk of stockouts.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Can we use highly granular modeled population and demographic characteristics (births, pregnancies) with consumption data to better position and distribute family planning commodities to where they are needed?   Would such a model increase the availability of family planning in high demand areas and reduce misalignment of supply?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This analysis approach has been piloted in seven states in Nigeria for the purpose of generating a replicable process in other countries. The available modeled population and demographic data from World Pop and the DHS will be used in combination with bimonthly consumption data from GHSC-PSM/Nigeria from May 2016 and December 2017. The initial analysis will be done at the local government area (LGA) level. The analysis will take a work bench approach where different statistical analysis approaches can be tested from linear regression to decision tree to identify the pattern relationships between the population/demographic data and consumption data of family planning commodities. Based on the finding of the analysis, a replicable process will be developed for analyzing the pattern relationship between demographic data and consumption patterns. The intention is to provide a model to assist in decision-making around supply and distribution of family planning commodities and ensure that distribution plans are appropriately targeted and aligned with the demand.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The results of the initial analysis show that there is a relationship in Nigeria between modern conceptive use with population and consumption for family planning commodities — condoms, implants, injectables, and oral conceptive pills. This matches the expectation that areas with high populations using modern conceptive would be consuming more than areas with low populations and low modern conceptive use. The strength of the relationship varied across commodities. The analysis also identified areas that did not match this general trend. The further investigation is focused on the areas that did not match the expected trend to identify the factors that are driving these findings. This to be done through use of additional demographic data such as births, pregnancies, wealth, unmet needs, and the other information. By understanding these patterns of consumption, the aim is to assist distribution planning of family planning commodities shown to be misaligned with demand.  </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Currently, the main approach for distribution of family planning commodities is based on past consumption, which is not only reactive but also possibly influenced by other factors than demand. The aim is to use additional data to better target the distribution of family planning commodities to help ensure they are available where they are most needed. Improved targeting of family planning commodities will also support the targeting of advocacy and family planning programs aimed at increasing the use of family planning. This approach will develop a way to provide actionable information that policymakers and implementers can use today. The approach strives to develop a replicable process that can then be applied to any country where modeled population and demographic data are available. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework, and SDG 5 specifically, growing attention is paid to gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment as both human rights goals in and of themselves as well as keys to achieving other development goals, like improvements in maternal health. Supporting this objective, several studies have reported an association between empowerment and improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes for girls, including the prevention of unintended pregnancy. Though empowerment is recognized as a process that evolves over the life course, there is very little understanding of its manifestations and linkages to sexual and reproductive health access in the early adolescents years, a critical period of development shaping reproductive health trajectories in the short and long terms. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between empowerment and self-efficacy in access to family planning (FP) among very young adolescent (VYA) girls and boys in Shanghai. We specifically aim to investigate how different dimensions of empowerment relevant to the lives of VYAs, such as freedom of movement, voice and decision-making in daily activities, relate to two aspects of perceived FP self-efficacy: knowledge about where to access FP services and embarrassment around FP service utilization. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The Global Early Adolescent Study in Shanghai is a longitudinal cohort study assessing normative, interpersonal and health outcomes across adolescence. Included participants were age 10-14, living with family, enrolled in three selected Jing’an district public schools, assented and obtained parental consent. Baseline data collection was completed December 2017. </p><p></p><p>Knowledge about where to access FP was assessed by two binary variables: knowledge about where to access 1) condoms and 2) contraception. Empowerment was assessed through three domains as scales scored continuously from 1-4: freedom of movement (n=1696, 6 items, polychoric ordinal cronbach’s alpha = 0.81), decision-making (n=1660, 4 items, alpha = 0.84) and voice (n=1725, 7 items, alpha = 0.88). Items from all 3 domains were used to construct an overall empowerment index. </p><p>Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions assessed associations between empowerment measures and each FP access outcome separately. Interaction terms between empowerment scores and sex were explored for each model and included in the final model if found to be significant. Models were stratified by sex and controlled for socio-demographic characteristics (age, wealth, socio-economic status) and factors thought to be associated with knowledge about access to FP (peer sexual history, pregnancy knowledge, relationship history)</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Mean scores for the empowerment domains were 2.34 for power, 3.08 for voice, 3.35 for decision and 2.86 for overall empowerment. Initial bivariate analyses found positive associations between freedom of movement and global empowerment scores, and knowledge about condom and contraceptive access. Multivariate regressions demonstrated positive associations between knowledge of where to access condoms and freedom of movement (AOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.24,1.74; p: </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Few studies have investigated the differential associations of empowerment and FP access among boys and girls in early adolescence. The results of this study demonstrate positive associations between domains of empowerment and knowledge of where to access condoms and contraception among VYAs in Shanghai, which were substantially stronger for girls than for boys after adjustment.  The strong associations found between empowerment domains and knowledge of FP access among girls supports interventions that aim to improve FP service utilization by promoting empowerment among girls. Finally, these findings highlight the need for further exploration of the link between empowerment and FP service utilization outcomes in the early adolescent period, as well as investigations into the development of this association over adolescent period as VYAs begin to engage in sexual activity and become exposed to pregnancy risk</p>",

      "title": "Contraceptive Autonomy: Conceptions and Measurement of a Novel Family Planning Indicator.",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Since at least 1798, when Thomas Malthus published <em>Essay on the Principle of Population</em>, scholars have debated whether and how human population size should be modified to maximize human welfare. In the post-colonial era, population planning became integrated with international development programs, and the advent of modern contraception provided new ways for policy-makers to exert influence on reproductive behaviors. </p><p>The mainstream family planning movement remained primarily focused on the topics of fertility and contraceptive coverage until 1994, when the International Conference on Population and Development was held in Cairo. It was at this conference that the reproductive health and rights approach to family planning supplanted population control, affirming the rights of all women, regardless of age or background, to access high-quality family planning.</p><p>Yet despite this conceptual sea change, rationales emphasizing fertility reduction are still common. Contemporary family planning programs are often motivated by a whole host of aims, with concern for women's rights and health are mixed in with the pursuit of external goals such as the demographic dividend or environmental protection.  The blurring of these motives can result in blurred priorities for programs and providers, who then have to balance meeting women's own needs with promoting fertility reduction.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This study seeks to understand women’s experiences with family planning service provision as they relate to autonomy in contraceptive decision-making in urban and rural Burkina Faso.  We hypothesize that there are several different types of barriers that Burkinabé women face to autonomous decision-making, and so seek to explore these barriers.  We further hypothesize that there are several dimensions of contraceptive autonomy (information, access, freedom), and that the salience of these dimensions varies for different women.  We explore women's interpretations of their experiences of non-autonomy with family planning providers.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We based our research in the Ouagadougou and Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems.  Ouagadougou is the capital of Burkina Faso, and our sampling frame at the northern periphery of the city included both longtime city dwellers and more recent migrants to the city.  Nouna, a small town near the Mali border, provided access to a diverse sample of rural women.</p><p>We conducted 48 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with women of reproductive age (15-49 years), as well as 3 key informant interviews with health systems personnel.  We used purposive sampling to promote diversity across a number of sociodemographic factors including marital status, age, education and religion.  Both FGDs and IDIs were semi-structured and conducted in French, Mooré or Dioula according to participant preference.  All interviews with audio-recorded with respondent consent, transcribed verbatim, and translated into French when necessary.</p><p>Transcripts were double-coded by two researchers using an inductive coding approach to thematic content analysis.  Iterative coding resulted in a codebook, from which salient themes and categories were explored to saturation. Axial coding was used to explore and delineate connections between identified categories relating to autonomy and quality in family planning.  Illustrative quotes were retained.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Our interviews elicited a wide variety of experiences with contraceptive non-autonomy among respondents. These stories came from all types of women and, surprisingly, did not seem to be associated with specific sociodemographic traits, including education (or lack thereof).</p><p>Many women shared stories about receiving a method against their will or being compelled to keep a method that they wanted to discontinue. Women described a continuum of non-autonomous contraceptive care, ranging from subtle pressure coming from providers (such as biased information and strongly directive counseling), to scare tactics and threats, to overt coercion (such as inserting LARC without women's knowledge).  Difficulty with discontinuation was most common among women using LARC, but there were also stories of women continuing to use shorter-acting methods against their will out of fear.</p><p>There was considerable diversity among respondents regarding the acceptability of these actions.  For some women, many types of non-autonomous care were normalized or even endorsed. The overwhelming respect that some women have for health providers seemed to outweigh the concern about conduct that infringed on patient autonomy.  And yet, many women expressed dismay and anger over what they considered to be unacceptable provider behaviors, especially for the more overt violations.</p><p>In addition to provider behaviors, we found some systems-level barriers to contraceptive autonomy, such as a dramatically limited method mix, especially in rural areas.  Interviews with district health supervisors revealed that some providers may feel motivated to reach contraceptive uptake targets set at the clinic and district levels. Many experiences with non-autonomy took place during the posrpartum period.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Although voluntarism is ever the watchword in global family planning programs, to our knowledge our study is among the first ever to explicitly explore themes of voluntarism and autonomy in sub-Saharan Africa.  By understanding what women's experiences with contraceptive service providers are actually like, we can better assess to what extent family planning programs are adhering to the principles of voluntarism.  By beginning to explore the barriers to contraceptive autonomy in Burkina Faso, we hope to help leaders there and elsewhere gain insight into this problem and hopefully, find solutions to it. </p><p>Burkina Faso is not known as a hotbed of reproductive coercion nor is it infamous for a heavy-handed population policy.  Instead, the family planning programs in Burkina Faso are guided by the mainstream of the global family planning community, led by well-respected donors and NGOs in collaboration with the Ministry of Health.  What our results show, then, is that contraceptive non-autonomy may not be the province of a few rogue nations or malicious providers.  Rather, our data show that this may be the systematic result of a family planning program that is more concerned with contraceptive uptake than it is with women's rights.  This small-scale qualitative study is an important first step, but considerably more research is needed to understand the breadth and depth of these challenges. Meanwhile, these results argue strongly for a greater emphasis on women-centered, rights-based care in family planning.</p>",

      "title": "Measuring Contraceptive Self-Efficacy in Sub-Saharan Africa: piloting the CSESSA Scale",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Contraceptive self-efficacy (CSE), defined as a woman's belief in her own ability to succeed in contraceptive initiation and continued use, is recognized as a precursor to effective contraceptive uptake.  Yet, no standard tool exists to measure CSE among women in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). In practice, broad self-efficacy questions are often included unsystematically in surveys as a proxy measure for CSE among women in LMIC. This inconsistency contributes to findings that lack validity and transferability across settings.</p><p>Currently, one CSE scale exists. This was developed by Levinson in 1998 to measure CSE among adolescents in high-income settings.  Items from Levinson’s scale do not appropriately transfer to women in LMIC. In an effort to develop a relevant measure of CSE among women in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the present research: 1) adapts selected concepts from Levinson’s scale for LMIC settings; 2) proposes new items; and 3) using a sample of Nigerian women, pilots a new scale for the context of SSA.  A reliable scale to measure Contraceptive Self-Efficacy in Sub-Saharan Africa (CSESSA) will advance the field’s understanding of contraceptive empowerment and related behaviors in this priority region, which holds the world’s greatest burden of unmet need for family planning.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The current research seeks to determine whether a scale to measure Contraceptive Self-Efficacy in Sub Saharan Africa (CSESSA) produces a reliable measure of CSE among a sample of women of reproductive age (WRA) in Nasarawa State, Nigeria. We hypothesize that our new scale, informed by qualitative findings and the literature, will sufficiently measure CSE in this sample. We further hypothesize that a woman’s score on the CSESSA scale will be associated with her contraceptive behavior.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Scale items were developed through an iterative process. We assessed the transferability of Levinson’s scale across LMIC settings, including SSA. Concepts underlying certain scale items were selected for inclusion in the CSESSA scale based on relevance to the target population. Findings from focus group discussions with WRA in Nasarawa informed item development. Bandura's theories on self-efficacy guided development of new items to identify difficulties women encounter when seeking contraceptive services in SSA. Iterations of scale items were reviewed and revised by in-country colleagues and a group of remote reproductive health experts. The new 21-item scale was pilot-tested among 8 postpartum women attending local health clinics, and revisions were made prior to data collection.</p><p>The preliminary CSESSA scale is being administered through May 2018 as part of a survey to WRA participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by Jhpiego in Nasarawa. The survey sample size of 1,076 women is deemed sufficient given the resulting subject-to-item ratio. Data are being analyzed in Stata14. Reliability and principal components analysis are being performed. Exploratory factor analysis is being conducted using promax rotation. A ROC curve is also produced to assess criterion validity of the scale against current modern contraceptive use.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Scale items relate to partner communication, family influence, provider communication, and choosing and managing a method.  Data collectors ask women to rate the certainty with which they can do each item. A visual analogue scale is used as an aide to describe the response options, which range from 0 (“cannot do at all”) to 10 (“highly certain can do.”)</p><p>To date, the scale has been administered to 187 WRA, nearing the sample size required by the ratio of subject-to-item guidelines of 10 subjects per item. By the conference, data collection and analysis will be complete for the total sample, allowing adequate sample size for split-half reliability analysis. Results of preliminary analyses using the subset of available data follow.</p><p>Reliability analysis of the 21 items produced a Cronbach’s Alpha of .9677 and average inter-item covariance of 6.3821, indicating a reliable measure. Principal components analysis with scree plot, performed to assess the number of factors needed for exploratory factor analysis, indicated a 3-factor model. In exploratory factor analysis, all 21 items produced rotated factor loadings above 0.45 with uniqueness variances below 0.47, indicating that all items should remain in the scale. At least 5 items were retained per factor.</p><p>The diagnostic utility of the CSESSA total score to predict current modern contraceptive use was assessed by the ROC area under the curve, which was 0.6933. This represents a fair measure with room for improvement. Bivariate analysis of CSESSA total score quintiles against current modern contraceptive use revealed a positive, significant relationship (p=0.020).</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The CSESSA scale provides a reliable measure for contraceptive self-efficacy among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. This fills a void, as a standard instrument to measure CSE among women in LMICs has been lacking. Preliminary analysis indicates that a woman’s score on the CSESSA may predict her propensity for modern contraceptive uptake. Analysis of the total sample will reveal whether this relationship is statistically significant, which would suggest that the CSESSA provides a valid measure. While comprehensive assessment of scale validity awaits the final sample, preliminary findings are promising.</p><p>The CSESSA Scale is concurrently being piloted in Kenya as part of the same cluster RCT. Results from the Kenya sample will also be used to validate this scale.</p><p>On a programmatic level, the CSESSA scale may be used to evaluate and improve interventions aimed at improving CSE and contraceptive uptake.  For example, used as a scale it can indicate if CSE needs to be addressed in conjunction with other health system issues that may be impacting contraceptive access.  Individual item analysis can also guide service providers and stakeholders in identifying specific actions associated with contraception adoption and use for which women have low self-efficacy.  This information would allow more precise prioritization of programmatic focus, potentially resulting in a more effective and efficient improvement process.   </p>",

      "title": "Reproductive choice for family planning and childbearing: Where does women’s empowerment fit in? Findings from a three-country qualitative study",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The establishment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demonstrated renewed commitment to improve women’s empowerment globally as a means of achieving health and development targets. In this endeavor, family planning (FP) use is believed to be associated with women’s empowerment and is a central mechanism through which women exert control over the number, spacing and timing of children. Over the last decade, considerable research has explored the relationships between empowerment and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes, however, variance in empowerment conceptualization, definitions, and measures inhibit study interpretability and comparison.</p><p>The proposed Women’s and Girls’ Sexual and Reproductive Health Empowerment (WGE-SRH) framework tackles several issues in the SRH empowerment literature. It recognizes the multilevel locus of reproductive decisions, shaped by community norms, family and partner influences, and internal motivations across these levels, thereby framing empowerment domains and outcomes in a more comprehensive light. This framework also expands on the World Bank’s empowerment process, defined as movement from existence of choice (autonomy) through exercise of choice (self-efficacy, negotiation, and decision-making) to achieved choice, specifically for SRH outcomes. Finally, application of this framework in cross-cultural contexts is critical to enhancing our limited understanding and measurement of the relationship between empowerment and SRH outcomes.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>This qualitative study aimed to explore WGE-SRH through the lens of the proposed framework in four culturally and geographically diverse communities. This paper examines the domains of women’s and girls’ existence and exercise of reproductive choice as they relate to family planning and pregnancy practices. The research questions include:  </p><ul>\t<li>What constrains or enhances the existence of women’s choice for pregnancy and contraception?</li>\t<li>How do women act on their preferences and what prevents them from doing so?</li>\t<li>How are pregnancy and contraceptive decisions negotiated within the couple, family and community and modified throughout the life course?</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The WGE-SRH qualitative study was conducted in four sites across three countries: Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda. Within each site, 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 30 in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted from July-August 2017 among women aged 15-49 and men aged 18 and older, selected from urban and rural communities. In each site, eight female and two male FGDs were conducted. IDI participants comprised 12 couples, who were interviewed separately (12 females and 12 males) and 6 unmarried women, who were equally divided between urban and rural settings.</p><p>Semi-structured IDI and FGD guides were developed to explore women’s sexual and reproductive autonomy, self-efficacy, negotiation, decision-making, and achievement. All interviews were conducted by trained interviewers in local language, audio-recorded, transcribed and translated verbatim by country partners and uploaded in Atlas.ti. An inductive thematic approach was implemented for analysis. Investigators from each site read transcripts and identified emerging themes, which supported the generation of an initial codebook, which was shared across sites and revised using an iterative process. Investigators in each site applied the core set of cross-country codes and developed site specific sub-codes. Matrices were used to assess patterns of family planning across sites and participant groups.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p><strong><em>Existence of reproductive choices</em></strong></p><p>Reproductive goals were internally and externally motivated through pressures and rewards from husbands, families and communities. Women were expected to bear children soon after marriage while premarital childbearing was highly sanctioned. In northern Nigeria, motivations to bear more children were particularly prevalent in polygamous families, where wives secured their influence and children’s inheritance through childbearing. Economics represented the largest constraint on pregnancy autonomy across sites. Large families no longer equated with social status, but instead were considered in the context of couple’s economic capacity, except in northern Nigeria. Respondents discussed transitioned social expectations of childbearing, emphasizing quality over quantity. Relational pressures, including fear of conflict, marital discord, dissolution and competition, shaped reproductive autonomy according to partner fertility desires. Women considered factors at multiple levels to assess contraceptive acceptability and restraints on FP choice. Providers significantly influenced contraceptive decisions, and coercive contraceptive experiences at both the provider and couple-level were frequent.</p><p><strong><em>Exercise of reproductive choices</em></strong></p><p>While women’s reproductive autonomy was constrained, they nonetheless found strategies to avert back-to-back pregnancies with or without their partners’ knowledge. Across sites, women relied on non-verbal communication to exercise their contraceptive preferences; covert use of contraception was pervasive. Direct communication was generally reserved for peers, and when conversations did occur with partners women emphasized economic constraints to justify their choices. Despite perceived consequences of using contraception at the individual (infertility, health concerns) and couple level (discord and separation), women and men both recognized women’s primacy over FP practices, whether concerted or not.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This is the first study of sexual and reproductive empowerment to incorporate the perspectives of never married women, individuals in polygamous relationships, couples’ perspectives, and male perspectives to explore the mechanisms through which SRH outcomes manifest in sub-Saharan Africa. These findings underscore the pivotal role that existence and exercise of reproductive preferences play in shaping women’s decisions, practices, and behaviors regarding contraceptive use and pregnancy.</p><p>Social expectations related to women’s SRH, valuing childbearing soon after marriage and discouraging women from initiating discussions about sex, pregnancy and contraception, impede women’s reproductive autonomy and their ability to act on it. The findings also expose strong internal motivations, constraining reproductive autonomy, such as misconceptions about family planning. Future empowerment research should explore the interplay of external and internal motivators to better understand the trade-offs shaping SRH decisions and outcomes. Women’s pervasive reliance on non-verbal tactics to engage partners about pregnancy and contraception highlights the need to re-conceptualize existing self-efficacy measures, which remain verbal communication centric.</p><p>Together these findings support the WGE-SRH framework that examines the interrelated concepts of autonomy, self-efficacy, negotiation and decision-making as it applies to reproductive behaviors and outcomes and the development of a quantitative measure that reflects these domains. Indeed, conceptually grounded quantitative measures, that better capture the nuances of women’s reproductive autonomy and ability to act on their preferences, including non-verbal strategies is needed to monitor WGE-SRH over time and across geographies and better understand the causes and consequences of WGE-SRH to inform programs and policies.</p>",

      "title": "An mHealth SMS dialogue intervention including optional male partner involvement increases postpartum contraceptive use in Kenya: A randomized controlled trial",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Addressing high unmet need for contraception among postpartum women in low- and middle-income countries is a research and programmatic priority in family planning (FP). In Kenya, unmet need for limiting and spacing pregnancies within the first 2 years postpartum was estimated at 57%, and unintended pregnancies increase risk for poor reproductive and child health outcomes. Data suggest that the majority of postpartum women in Kenya initiate short-acting methods and discontinuation is common. While men are known to play a major role in reproductive decision-making, few interventions have incorporated male partners into couples-oriented FP education and counseling. Innovations in mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as SMS, have the potential to reach women and couples with timely and specific support for FP use in the postpartum period.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>We evaluated the effect of Mobile WACh XY, a novel mHealth intervention utilizing SMS dialogue, on postpartum contraceptive use among individual women and couples in Kenya. The primary outcome of the trial was self-reported use of a highly effective contraceptive (HEC) method at 6 months postpartum. HEC was defined as hormonal, intrauterine, and permanent contraception: methods available in Kenya with a </p>",
      "methodology": "<p> Mobile WACh XY was an unblinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) implemented at two public hospitals in western Kenya from July 2016 to September 2017 (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02781714P). Pregnant women were recruited from antenatal clinics, and eligibility criteria included: age ?14 years, gestational age ?28 weeks, HIV negative status, daily access to a mobile phone, able to read/respond to SMS. We randomized women (1:1) to receive interactive 2-way SMS or control (no SMS). Prior to randomization, women had the option to refer male partners for enrollment. Among women randomized to SMS, personalized, FP-focused SMS messages were delivered weekly to women individually or to couples (if partner was enrolled) until 6 months postpartum. Messages were tailored to couple status and chosen FP method. Female and male participants in the SMS arm were able to engage in SMS dialogue with a clinician free of charge. Survey data were collected at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 6 months postpartum. HEC use at 6 months postpartum was compared between groups by the chi-square test, and Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used in adjusted analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare time to initiation of FP between arms.</p><p></p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Among 260 randomized women, 254 were included in the analysis. There were 3 withdrawals (SMS arm) and 3 participants lost to follow up (control arm 1, SMS arm 2). Median age was 23, and the groups were similar with the exception of education, parity, and desire for future children. Most women were partnered (198, 76%), and 153 referred male partners, of whom 103 men were enrolled. Women and men engaged in SMS dialogue with the study nurses: median number of SMS sent was 20(IQR 9-38) among women and 7(IQR 3-13) among men. Study nurses sent a total of 2718 messages. At 6 months postpartum, HEC use prevalence was 69.9% in the 2-way SMS arm and 57.4% in the control arm (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47, p=0.04). In analysis adjusted for baseline differences, the adjusted RR(aRR) for HEC use was 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52, p=0.02. Women in the SMS group were also more likely to use any contraceptive method at 6 months postpartum (75.6% vs. 64.3%, aRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.41, p=0.04). First initiation of any contraceptive method over time, adjusted for baseline differences, showed a trend to be higher among women in the intervention arm by 6 months (Hazard ratio 1.31, 95% CI 0.96-1.78, p=0.09). Method mix was similar between arms at 14 weeks, but by 6 months more women in the SMS group were using HEC. At 6 months, injectable contraception was the most popular method in both arms (32%), and contraceptive implant users made up 25% female participants. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>We found that a 2-way SMS intervention significantly increased highly effective contraceptive use among postpartum women and couples in Kenya—a population at high risk for unintended pregnancy. Our findings suggest that a semi-automated and yet tailored mHealth innovation can enhance facility-based family planning services, providing support for contraceptive initiation and continuation in the postpartum period. This intervention generated a high level of SMS interaction between the participants and clinical provider, and demonstrates that inclusion of men in an FP mHealth intervention is feasible. We did not observe an intervention effect on contraceptive use until the 6-month time point, which suggests that the intervention had a cumulative effect as women and couples interacted with the system and perceived themselves to be at risk for pregnancy. Further study is needed into the optimal duration of messaging, and how to balance highly personalized messaging tracks with the level of automation needed to cost-effectively implement the intervention at scale. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Family planning is an effective tool for preventing death among women who do not want to become pregnant and has also been shown to improve newborn health outcomes, advance women’s empowerment, and bring socioeconomic benefits through reductions in fertility and population growth. Yet among the populations that would benefit the most from family planning, uptake remains too low. The emergence of digital health tools have created new opportunities to strengthen health systems and promote behavior change. In this study, women with an unmet need for family planning in Western Kenya were randomized to receive an encouragement to try an investigational digital health intervention.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The objectives of the pilot study were to explore the feasibility of a full-scale trial—in particular the recruitment, encouragement, and follow-up data collection procedures—and to examine the preliminary effect of the intervention on the take-up of contraception.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>This pilot study tested the procedures for a randomized encouragement trial. We recruited 112 women with an unmet need for family planning from local markets in Western Kenya, conducted an eligibility screening, and randomized half of the women to receive an encouragement to try the investigational intervention. Four months after encouraging the treatment group, we conducted a follow-up survey with enrolled participants.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The encouragement sent via text message to the treatment group led to differential rates of intervention uptake between the treatment and control groups, but take-up among the treatment group was lower than anticipated (33.9% vs 1.8% in the control group). Study attrition was also substantial. We obtained follow-up data from 44.6% of enrolled participants. Among those in the treatment group who tried the intervention, however, instrumental variables estimate of the Local Average Treatment Effect was an increase in the probability of contraceptive take-up of 41.0 percentage points.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>This randomized encouragement design and study protocol is feasible but requires modifications to the encouragement and follow-up data collection procedures. The investigational intervention appears to have a positive impact on contraceptive take-up among women with an unmet need despite a number of contextual challenges.</p>",

      "title": "Online and offline E-commerce as a way to increase access to contraceptives and ensure confidentiality",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 214 million women of reproductive age in the world who want to avoid pregnancy are not using a modern contraceptive method. Among the reasons for this high global un-meet need for contraception are: limited access to contraception, users and providers bias, and gender barriers. It is therefore critical to improve access to contraceptives and develop innovative methods that overcome barriers such as the social stigma associated with the use of contraception in many countries.</p><p>A recommended approach is to work with the private sector to strengthen the provision of contraception and reach vulnerable groups. Within this strategy, there is room for digital scalable strategies and e-commerce models to increase confidential access to contraceptives for women and young people. A case for this approach is Kasha—an online/offline e-commerce platform built in Rwanda operating in Rwanda and Kenya-- where women can order contraceptives conveniently and confidentially using a simple mobile phone or laptop. The company is leveraging technology to give women confidential access to any kind of contraceptive method, along with accurate supportive information so that each customer can select the method that works best for her.  </p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>Kasha is an online/offline e-commerce company that seeks to democratize access to women’s health and personal care products --via its widely accessible and confidential platform--putting decision-making power in the hands of the beneficiary. The company’s solution was built with a specific focus on women, aiming to overcome issues of social stigma in accessing health products such as contraceptives. Kasha’s solution enables women in urban and rural areas in Rwanda to use any basic mobile phone and confidentially order women’s health and personal care products such as contraceptives, sanitary pads, soaps, lotions, make-up and get the products discretely delivered to their location of choice.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Kasha has been operating in Rwanda since August 2016 and began operating in Kenya in February 2018. In Rwanda, Kasha has successfully delivered over <strong>75,000 </strong>units around the country Kasha serves both urban and rural women through a variety of models including an agent network to reach women at the bottom of the pyramid. Women are able to order contraceptives using the company’s e-commerce platform (www.kasha.rw) or to use a simple mobile telephone if they don’t have access to internet. Therefore, it does not require a smartphone or internet access to browse through products, order, and pay. Kasha also provides confidential access to family planning information via its partnerships with clinics.</p><p>With over <strong>19,000</strong> unique customers, this company is able to collect and report on consumption and preference data across demographics, that is both quantitative and qualitative. This helps provide insight on women’s needs and preferences for contraceptives. On the platform, women can purchase any type of contraceptive method from emergency contraception, daily pills, and long acting reversible contraception (LARCs) such as implants and injections giving them an array of options. For LARCs, Kasha connects women to vetted and trusted health providers that offer friendly and confidential services.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<ul>\t<li>Women appreciate confidentiality in accessing contraceptives and particularly condoms and emergency contraceptives. Our highest selling contraceptive is condoms and 2nd highest is emergency contraceptives. </li>\t<li>Customers consistently give positive feedback on the confidential ordering process which allows them to ask questions and receive products they need without any face-to-face interaction.</li>\t<li>The use of technology makes access to contraceptives more convenient for women. As an example, refills for daily pills don’t require a visit to a clinic or a pharmacy for Kasha customers and they don’t have to worry about disrupting their method because they did not have time to physically go to a pharmacy.</li>\t<li>There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding the use of LARCs with many women fearing that they will not be able to get pregnant once they stop usage.</li>\t<li>Home tests (e.g. pregnancy, fertility, and HIV-self tests) are popular products (28% of pharmaceutical orders). For low-income women, these are products they learn about for the first time through Kasha. For example, many women in such communities believe that they can only confirm a pregnancy when they have the time to go to a health clinic. Finding out about other options is very helpful for them.</li>\t<li>It is important to seek ways to make contraceptives affordable and convenient for women to obtain. Kasha uses a hybrid model with direct delivery, pick-up points, and agents to offer the option to obtain products with or without shipping cost and in multiple places. </li></ul>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<ul>\t<li>Confidentiality is pivotal in improving access to contraceptives. This is important in a country like Rwanda where in 2016 there were 17,000 unwanted teen pregnancies.</li>\t<li>E-commerce is an innovative solution that can be used to minimize the traditional face-to-face interaction often required to access contraceptives. It is convenient and if leveraged well it can potentially decrease the disruption of certain methods.</li>\t<li>There is a need to continue to educate women and girls on different contraceptives methods available, discuss side-effects, and dispel myths surrounding the use of LARCs. Education needs to focus on these issues to improve uptake of modern contraceptives.</li>\t<li>It is important to develop solutions suitable for women. Kasha has added a variety of products on its platform (e.g. cosmetic and personal care products) to optimize confidentiality. This way a Kasha order is not automatically associated with contraceptives (e.g. it could be a lipstick, pads, or a lotion)</li>\t<li>Government should support private sector initiatives and direct-to-consumer models like Kasha, since they are another viable venue for women to access contraceptives and critical sources of insight on consumer behavior for contraceptives.</li>\t<li>Governments should develop clear regulations and guidelines that enable the distribution of contraceptives through e-commerce platforms (e.g. prescription needs) and other innovative models.</li>\t<li>E-commerce is a friendly channel for women and young people to discuss reproductive health needs. Kasha offers phone consultations and this service can be the first opportunity for a customer to discuss comfortably their reproductive health needs including contraception.</li></ul>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Tanzania has an unacceptably high maternal mortality ratio at 556/100,000 live births (1). Preventing unwanted pregnancies and improving birth spacing is needed in parallel to improving obstetric services. Access to family planning services is limited in rural Tanzania particularly in the Lake Zone where the rate of modern contraceptive use is only 15 percent and the unmet need for contraception is 33 percent (2). Access to reliable contraception will decrease the need for women to attempt illegal and unsafe abortions, a known cause for about 16 percent of maternal deaths in Tanzania (3). There is evidence that community-based distribution programs can improve access to family planning services for rural poor women in Tanzania (4). Community health workers (CHWs) were found to be an effective cadre for this role in low and middle income countries where human resources for health services are limited (5).  The World Health Organization has called for training CHWs to “task shift” family planning services from skilled providers to these community-based lay health workers (6). CHWs can provide an extension to the health care system by educating couples about family planning methods, providing oral contraceptives and condoms, and referring women for more advanced methods. </p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>Access to family planning services in rural Tanzania can be enhanced using community health workers equipped with mobile phones and an m-health application that follows the family planning guidelines of Tanzania (by D-Tree International). Partnering this family planning project with a community health worker program to increase access to antenatal and delivery services will help reduce maternal deaths and lead to a better quality of life for rural Tanzanian women.  </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Rorya District, Mara Tanzania is a rural district just south of the Kenyan border on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria. We introduced a family planning program by training community health workers (CHWs) from each of the 89 villages in Rorya to meet with the girls and women in their villages with family planning needs. Beginning in early 2018, these women were registered on the m-health application, asked about their current method of family planning, and then educated on their family planning options. The CHWs would provide condoms and oral contraception directly, and refer the women for more advanced methods such as injectables, intrauterine devices and implantables. In addition, we trained nurses to use the m-health system to monitor stock. Several providers were selected to have in-depth training on advanced methods such as IUCD and implantable insertions. Family planning days were held at the hospital to provide tubal ligations and vasectomies to interested couples. The m-health data was used to determine baseline method use, initiation of new methods, ongoing use of a family planning method and engagement of the CHWs in the project. The presentation will report on the first eight months of the project’s findings. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In the first two months of the project (February and March 2018) 55 of the 89 CHWs were active. They recruited 704 women. Preliminary data on baseline family planning use included 276 women using implants, 173 women using injections and 37 women using IUCDs. Other methods used were oral contraception (12), male condoms (4), lactational amenorrhea (4), female condoms (3), emergency contraception (1), vasectomy (1), and natural method (1). Over the first 2 months of the project there were 137 new initiations of a family planning method. At the time of the conference we intend to present data on the first 8 months of the project (February to September 2018) focussing on the baseline use of family planning, initiations on new methods maintenance of introduced methods, involvement of adolescents in family planning, and activities of the CHWs promoting family planning. We will also report on the program’s challenges to implementation including the need for ongoing training and supervision to keep the CHWs engaged in the project. </p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>     This study demonstrates that family planning access in rural Tanzania can be improved by using community health workers with m-health tools to educate women about methods, provide basic methods to women and refer for more advanced family planning methods. We will discuss the challenges of training these village workers to use the m-health application and the synergy with our maternal health project using CHWs to improve women’s access to health services for antenatal care and delivery. We will also review our ongoing engagement with policy makers. This study contributes to the knowledge base of using CHWs for task shifting in family planning, using m-health apps to educate women and collect data and combining family planning programs with maternity care programs. </p><p></p><p><b>References from Background</b></p><p>1.

      "significanceBackground": "<p>India was one of the first countries in the world to have a national family planning programme(1952). However, quality and choice remained a challenge. Instances of complication, failure and deaths due to sterilisation are reported from across the country.[i] In the federal set up of India, implementation of health programmes depended on State’s capacity.</p><p>In Odisha, a State with 42million population, over 90 % clients depended on the public health sector for Family Planning services. Information and services for FP was skewed and method mix revealed that nearly three-fourth of all acceptors where women opting sterilization; only 9 % non-users where reached out with information on contraceptives and three out of four were never told about side effects of method that they were using. Incentives for accepting FP and motivation fee compromised choices and decision making. [ii] Contraceptive supplies followed a push method, a system to track stocks and supplies was absent and contraceptive distribution to health institutions was not based on a scientific needs assessment.</p><p>Need based planning and budgeting was missing, top down budget driven target oriented services influenced the family planning programme.</p> <p>[i] India’s latest sterilisation camp massacre, Abhijit Das, BMJ 2014;349:g7282</p><p>[ii] National Family Health Survey -3, 2005-6, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare http://rchiips.org/NFHS/nfhs3.shtml</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>UNFPA collaborated with the State’s health department with an objective of promoting quality family planning services. Between 2010 and 2016, a two pronged approach was adopted, where on one hand the focus was on system strengthening and on the other, evidence generation for policy changes to promote client oriented services. The partnership between UNFPA and the State government worked through knowledge management, capacity building and advocacy.</p><p>In summary, UNFPA’s system strengthening effort was to facilitate bottom up planning, streamline contraceptive supply management, promote standards in FP services, improve access to contraceptives, client centered counselling and support periodic external monitoring.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>UNFPA supported family welfare cell extended techno-managerial support to improve FP programme. Following a yearlong process of consultations, conduct of facility needs assessment and population data analysis, the programme managers for the first time developed district-wise FP plans. The 30 district plans then became the basis for budget allocation, infrastructure development, capacity building, IEC, procurement and supplies. [i]</p><p>The next big challenge was to streamline the contraceptive supply chain management. A pilot initiative in two districts by UNFPA, led to an innovative online and mobile telephony based application that fetched real time information on contraceptive stocks and supplies from over 7000 health facilities across the State, including 6688 health sub-centers managed by female multi-purpose health workers. It took over four years to stabilize the use of application, besides connecting health workers in remote corners of the state, information on availability of contraceptives at health facilities that can be accessed by clients was the USP of the application.</p><p>Series of training and capacity building programmes for medical officers, nurses, counselors and front line functionaries, over a period of five years promoted client oriented services at health facilities including improved access to information and services for non-clinical contraceptives in the community.</p> <p>[i] http://health.odisha.gov.in/Family_planning/FP_Plan_%202015_16.pdf</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Evidence based advocacy and strategic investments in FP programme of the State has resulted in paradigm shift in services through improved systems and client oriented services.  </p><p>There is an evident shift from target oriented women sterilization to increasing acceptance for spacing methods. Among all users of modern methods, women accepting sterilization decreased from 74 to 62 percent, the oral pill users increased from 7 to 12 percent,  the unmet need particularly for spacing reduced (to 4.6 percent) [i] and the States TFR now 2. [ii] Access to information on FP improved by nearly threefold in a decade (from 22% to 62%), albeit one third clients still remain deprived of complete information on contraceptives. [iii]</p><p>Incentives and dis-incentives are giving way to informed choices. Findings from a UNFPA’s study on State sponsored schemes such as the green card (incentives for accepting sterilization after one or two children in the family) and others have resulted in the state withdrawing conditionality of small family for access to benefits. Camp based services are replaced by fixed day static services through strong government circulars. User friendly application for contraceptive logistics is a model for the country and is being replicated as FP-LMIS. </p><p>[i] National Family Health Survey -4, 2015-16 , Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, http://rchiips.org/NFHS/pdf/NFHS4/OR_FactSheet.pdf</p><p>[ii] Sample Registration System Statistical Report 2016, Office of the Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India</p><p>[iii] National Family Health Survey -4, 2015-16 , Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, http://rchiips.org/NFHS/pdf/NFHS4/OR_FactSheet.pdf</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Long term and sustainable results on system strengthening. Availability of resources alone does not translate into action that are client oriented but meaningful participation of all key stakeholders is essential in designing and implementing successful  programmes and ensure reach to the most marginalized.</p><p>Independent assessments and third party evaluation should back up routine monitoring mechanisms to pick up the need for systemic changes. Generating local evidence can influence policies to be rights based. Promoting quality services through the public health system requires systematic investments in capacity building of providers, coupled with supportive supervision and monitoring. Contraceptives in FP programme are as important as vaccines to child health programme and ensuring uninterrupted supplies through a robust LMIS should be a priority. To ensure successful pilot initiatives are scaled up, all stakeholders should be engaged from inception to implementation and evaluation.</p><p>   </p><p>Family planning programme should not be considered as a means for population control or as a measure to reduce maternal and infant deaths by the public health sector. Policy makers, programme managers and functionaries at all levels need to recognize the right of individuals and couples to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and the obligation of service providers to ensure rights holders have the information and means to do.</p><p></p><p>Bottom up approach for a need based planning and budget allocation, an efficient system for contraceptive supply management, emphasis on quality, client oriented services and periodic monitoring are key to successful implementation of FP programmes. </p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Mozambique has seen significant progress in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the past six years with a 2-fold increase in the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) from 11.3 in 2011 (DHS) to 25.3 percent in 2015 (IMASIDA), however unmet need remains high at 23.1% for all women and particularly among adolescents and youth with the highest unmet need in the 15-19 year-old age group at 26.2%. Additionally, the method mix remains skewed towards short-acting methods as exhibited in IMASIDA (2015).  To achieve progress and increase knowledge and access to the full method mix, effort is required on both the supply and demand sides.  A system wide approach across the continuum from community to facilities at different levels is needed, however too often, community and facility programs operate in isolation, preventing synergies and maximal progress.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>As part of a multi-country initiative, the Pathfinder <em>MAIS</em> project operates in 36 urban and peri-urban health facilities in Maputo City and Matola, Mozambique. Facilities are supported with training, mentorship, and supply of key equipment and renovations.  Facility-level interventions are complemented by robust community engagement activities. Feedback loops between the community and facility components support quality improvement in services provided including a community report card, support to co-management committees and quarterly data review meetings at the facility-level. </p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The <em>MAIS</em> project team of 203 community health workers (CHWs) used a systematic, house-to-house approach to reach underserved women of reproductive age with tailored individual counseling and referrals for family planning (FP) services, emphasis on dispelling myths and misconceptions about long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods. Women are counseled and referred to nearby facilities for services. From July 2015-December 2017, the project reached 392,220 women through the work of CHWs, of which 97% consented to contraceptive counseling, of these 75% were referred to health facilities and 169,581 (54% of those referred) completed their referrals. After visiting the health facility, women were again visited by the CHWs at regular intervals of one, four weeks, and 3 or 6 months and 1 year depending on the method used, to support continuation.  At the follow-up visits, women were offered to complete a Citizen Report Card (CRC) through the CHW’s <em>CommCare</em> digital health platform. During project implementation 42% (71,271) of the women who completed the referral agreed to answer the CRC questions. The brief questionnaire asks about the client’s experience and perceptions of care at the health facility. CRC data is then reviewed quarterly by the community co-management committee (CMC) of each facility.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>By linking community and facility components of the project, <em>MAIS</em> has been able to maximize results and overcome both demand and supply-side barriers to LARC access according to the project data records. LARC has increased almost 6-fold (from 5922 women choosing interval IUD and Implants in 2015 to 33097 in 2017); LARC method mix changed from 6% in the first year of implementation to 24% in 2017 while short acting methods decreased from 94% to 75%; PPFP covered 0.1 % of the deliveries in 2015 and reached 33% in 2017; with 56% of PPFP uptake due to IUDs. Per recent discussions with several MAIS project-supported in-charges in facilities including maternity ward in-charges, initial resistance to LARC methods such as client/community concerns and misconceptions, provider disinformation and resistance to providing as it “demands” more work than a pill or injection. Related behavioral and technical bias influenced the clients’ method choice and the services quality. This represented a significant barrier to successful LARC and postpartum LARC integration towards the beginning of the project. The in-charges credited the community-level “sensitization” with facilitating discussions about long-acting methods. Challenges uncovered from CMC review of CRC data have included: completed referral not receiving a method of her choice due to referred lack of gloves, sterilized surgical equipment later confirmed as untrue; completed referral having to pay for services knowing that gratuity was part of the counseling when pursuing public sector health facilities; provider demand to see clients blood from menstruation to provide FP method.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Strengthening of feedback loops has been critical for clarifying and addressing both community and facility barriers to contraceptive services. Client feedback to the facilities has been also been critical to identify gaps and increase accountability. All the cases were taken to discussion with the HF providers and regular performance review meetings, strategic “deep dive” sessions, and experience sharing exercises became a routine part of Pathfinder International’s approach to project implementation based on the updated CRC data analysis. In addition to CRC data, the program tracks differences in trends between method selected during CHW counseling and method received at the facility.  In some cases, this uncovered provider bias against LARC for youth with clients referred for LARC who later received short term methods at the facility.  The project team and mentors were then able to work more closely with those providers and facilities to improve service quality. Supporting strong connections between community and facility activities requires concerted efforts to establish or strengthen feedback mechanisms and forums. However, the insights generated can provide rich information to inform program design and make course corrections as well as ensuring accountability to the people served.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The fertility rate among women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is very high, at 6.6 births per woman. This can partially be explained by the low use of modern contraceptive methods (8%). While 27.7% of women of reproductive age have unmet need for modern contraceptive methods, DRC faces a significant challenge in ensuring access to family planning services[1].</p><p></p><p>The DRC National Strategic Plan 2014-2020 outlines a multisectoral vision that aims to increase the modern contraceptive prevalence to 19% and ensure that at least 2.1 million women can access and use modern contraceptive methods by 2020. To rapidly increase access to and information about family planning services, the Ministry of Health introduced a community-based distribution approach engaging at least three community-based distributors (CBDs) of family planning methods per health area. Even in health areas with at least three CBDs, with an average of only one CBD per 700 women of reproductive age, coverage is low. The limited numbers of CBDs per population, coupled with their low motivation, contribute to poor family planning service coverage in villages and households.</p> <p>[1] DRC Ministry of Planning, DRC Demographic and Health Survey, 2013-2014</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The DRC Ministry of Health has successfully used vaccination campaigns for polio and measles to reach target populations, leading to increased immunization coverage and a reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases[2]. The USAID-funded Integrated Health Project Plus (IHPplus) adapted this field-tested approach of using vaccination campaigns to family planning. Three-day mini-campaigns were designed to mobilize communities and provide door-to-door services for family planning services, while supporting and motivating the CBDs.</p> <p>[2] DRC Ministry of Health, Expanded Program on Immunization Annual Reports, 2015 and 2016</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>Using data from the national health information system (HIS), 28 health areas were selected from six health zones in three provinces (Sud Kivu, Kasaï Oriental, and Lomami). Despite the presence of trained and equipped CBDs, use of family planning services in these areas was low (less than 200 new family planning users in the past three months).</p><p></p><p>From January to March 2018, IHPplus and the National Reproductive Health Program (PNSR) worked with health zones to implement mini-campaigns. One week prior, “town criers” with megaphones notified the community about the upcoming household visits of CBDs and shared key messages and information on the advantages of family planning. CBDs then went door-to-door for three days to every household, counseling and providing short-term contraceptive methods and referring individuals choosing long-term methods (implants, intra uterine devices [IUDs]) and the hormonal injectable Depo-Provera® to fixed sites where nurses provided these methods.</p><p></p><p>Campaign data were collected and reported into the national HIS. These data were used to determine the number of new family planning users, calculate the couple years of protection (CYP), and determine the method mix. Data from the campaign were compared with data from the same time period in 2017.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Preliminary results indicate that the number of new family planning users in targeted health areas almost doubled, from 4,505 users in the first quarter of 2017 to 7,129 users following the three-day campaign in 2018. The twelve health areas that reported the lowest number of new users of family planning services (less than 100) in the first quarter of the previous year saw the number of new users double, triple, and even multiply tenfold during the campaign, whereas health areas with more than 100 family planning users at the start of the comparison period and health areas that had already organized a family planning campaign did not record significant variation.</p><p>The CYP among new users increased from 1,905 in the first quarter of 2017 to 2,589 during the three days of the campaign. The contraceptive method mix for the targeted health areas shows that implants are the most commonly used method of contraception (40%), followed by injectables (22%) and condoms (18%). Data collected during the campaign revealed higher utilization of implants (37%), condoms (29%), and injectables (15%). Data indicated a higher use of condoms during the campaign than shown by the method mix.</p><p>Comparison of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and intramuscular DMPA methods showed that during the pre-campaign period, 80% of injectable use was intramuscular DMPA, while during the campaign the subcutaneous DPMA accounted for 85% of all injectable methods. Possible contributing factors include the increased availability of subcutaneous DMPA through CBDs.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>These results illustrate that the family planning mini-campaigns can be an effective strategy for improving access to and use of family planning services. Communication during the campaigns, combined with home visits, can spark discussions between couples and the community about family planning. Supervision by doctors and nurses may reassure the community and strengthen the connection between CBDs and the community. Immediate feedback from supervisors improved the work of CBDs, and was a key factor contributing to the strong results. The role of CBDs in the campaigns is to improve the monitoring and continuity of service; however, further studies are needed to evaluate the continuity of service for clients choosing short-term contraceptive methods.</p><p></p><p>Preliminary results from IHPplus show that this strategy was most effective for reaching underserved health areas – even with a small number of CBDs – where the unmet need for family planning was high. Large-scale implementation could accelerate progress towards achieving the DRC Ministry of Health’s goal of 2.1 million family planning users by 2020 and reducing unmet family planning needs among women of childbearing age.  The strategy may also be useful in similar contexts with high unmet need and limited access.</p><p></p>",

      "title": "The impact of the targeted district approach in reducing unmet need for family planning: the case of the RESPOND Tanzania Project",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The RESPOND Tanzania Project (RTP), funded by USAID, supports the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children (MOHCDGEC) to increase access to high-quality family planning (FP) services, especially long-acting reversible contraceptives and permanent methods (LARCs/PMs). Tanzania has made enormous gains in FP use over the past 25 years. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) for any FP method quadrupled between 1991 and 2016, from less than 8% to 38%. The biggest increases in the voluntary use of LARCs/PMs were witnessed in the past decade, with the percentage of currently married women using a LARC or PM increasing from 3% in 2004–2005 to 11% in 2015–2016. Despite these gains in FP use, unmet need for FP has remained high in the country, ranging between 22% and 25%, especially in rural and hard-to-reach areas of Tanzania. In collaboration with the Government of Tanzania through MOHCDGEC, RTP implemented FP activities across all regions of Tanzania, focusing on 110 higher priority districts. The five-year project targeted women of reproductive age through a targeted district approach to address unmet need for FP, especially in hard-to-reach areas.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>To implement this approach, districts were categorized into three levels. Level 1 districts had the lowest FP uptake and received an intensive package of interventions. Supported activities included capacity building for local health system strengthening, in-service trainings, community mobilization, and direct support through outreach and special FP service days. Level 2 districts received a less-intensive package, with greater emphasis on partner collaboration to strengthen and deliver FP services. Interventions in Level 3 districts focused on building district capacity to take ownership of their FP and reproductive health (RH) activities, guided by the National Essential Package of FP Interventions.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>RTP identified 110 districts with low FP uptake and high unmet need and targeted them with varied packages of intensive FP programming. To select target districts, RTP calculated FP uptake per 10,000 women of reproductive age for each district during the period of October 2010 to September 2011, using data from the national health management information system (HMIS). Based on this metric, districts were grouped into one of three levels. Districts in Level 1 had the lowest uptake of FP, while Level 3 districts had the highest. Based on the analysis, 110 districts were selected for RTP programming between 2012 and 2017, 83% of which fell into Levels 1 and 2. FP data for the period of October 2012–September 2016 were collected through the Government of Tanzania’s HMIS. FP uptake was measured for the following methods: minilaparotomy, no-scalpel vasectomy (NSV), implants, the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD), injectables, and oral contraceptives (pills). FP data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, and impact was estimated using Marie Stopes International’s Impact2 tool.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Early into implementation, data showed an increase in FP uptake as a result of implementation of the targeted district approach. Compared with the previous year, voluntary use of any short-acting, long acting, or permanent FP method increased overall by 11% in Year 1. By the end of Year 3, the number of districts with the lowest FP uptake (Level 1) started to decline. By the end of the project, the number of districts with the lowest FP uptake (Level 1) had decreased by 50%, and the number of districts with the highest FP uptake (Level 3) had increased by 121%. The numbers of districts at both Level 1 and Level 2 shifted to a higher level over time, with 56% of the 54 Level 1 districts graduating to Level 2 by Year 4 and 57% of the 37 Level 2 districts moving to Level 3. Overall, the number of women across all levels adopting an IUCD in Year 4 was 600% higher than at baseline (from roughly 34,000 to 207,000), and the number of women receiving hormonal implants increased by 800% (from roughly 71,000 to 642,000). Women choosing minilaparotomy under local anesthesia also increased 128%, from 53,000 at baseline to 123,000 in Year 4. Based on impact estimates, the FP services provided during direct, RTP-supported FP events averted 2.6 million unintended pregnancies and 778,000 unsafe abortions and likely saved more than $168 million in direct health care costs.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>RTP’s experience shows that a targeted district approach can improve the voluntary use of FP in areas with traditionally low FP uptake. The high participation in FP among female clients during FP weeks, one-day outreaches, and special FP service days emphasizes the need for FP access in hard-to-reach and underserved areas of Tanzania. FP programming that targets underserved areas can make the greatest impact toward achieving FP2020 goals and other national and international FP commitments. In addition to preventing unintended pregnancies, maternal deaths, and unsafe abortions, effective provision of FP has positive impacts on other sectors beyond health and contributes to a healthier and more prosperous Tanzania.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>While statistics show that 222 million women had unmet need in the first year of post-delivery in 2012, availing to them with modern contraceptive methods would prevent an additional 54 million from unintended pregnancies in developing countries. In Rwanda, unmet need among married women is 19% and modern contraceptive prevalence rate among married women has increased from 10% in 2005 to 48% in 2014/2015, according to Rwanda demographic and Health Surveys (RDHS). The most common method used by married women was injectables (24%), the pills (8%) and implants (8%). However, the uptake of Intra Uterine Device (IUD) remains persistently low at 0.5% in 2010 to 0.7% in 2014/2015 (RDHS). Estimates revealed that 91% of women in Rwanda delivered at health facilities (RDHS 2015). This provides an opportunity to provide Postpartum Family Planning (PPFP).</p><p>In 2010, Ministry of Health (MOH) in collaboration with JHPIEGO introduced Post Partum Intra Uterine Device (PPIUD) into routine care. Muhima Hospital piloted PPIUD since it is a health Facility with high delivery volume and is a center of maternal and child health. This abstract aims to share program experience of 7 years and highlight lessons learnt during the implementation of the PPIUD in urban setting.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>MOH and JHPIEGO planned to introduce PPFP/PPIUD during antenatal, latent labor and immediately after delivery, in order to address unmet needs in post-partum periods and increase FP uptake among potential FP users. This intervention started as a pilot activity to in 2010 at Muhima district hospital, a large maternity hospital. It was delivered through trainings of providers, supportive supervision and mentorship. Trained staff was medical doctors and nurses.  The training focused on theory and practical modules including five trial IUD insertion under supervision.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The PPFP/ PPIUD initiative started in May 2010 at Muhima district hospital. Muhima is located in the city of Kigali and regarded as the largest maternity hospital in Rwanda. Results of this intervention reflect a period of 7 years since the pilot of PPFP in Rwanda. Nurses working in the maternity ward and medical doctors were trained in a 10-days training on PPFP counseling and PPIUD insertion under supervision.  The kits and consumable supplies were distributed in maternity. PPFP counseling was provided continuously to the mothers during antenatal care, in latent labor and in immediate post partum period. The IUDs were inserted to the agreed women in Post-partum (within 48 hours after childbirth). Following the insertion, PPIUD recipient received two follow-up consultations at four to six weeks and three months respectively, to check for adverse effects, expulsion, infection, removal and client satisfaction. Ultrasonography was used at second visit to ascertain the device’s position. Clients’ information was compiled and reported into the HMIS database. Data were extracted from maternity registers and client’s personal file from May 2010 to March 2018 and entered into excel sheet for analysis.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>In total, three medical doctors and 26 nurses and midwives working in the prenatal care, labor, delivery and postnatal wards were trained on PPFP counseling and PPIUD insertion techniques. Supportive supervision visits were conducted every month by national trainers to monitor progress and identify challenges in record keeping and service delivery.</p><p>From May 2010 to March 2018, the hospital recorded 43,000 deliveries. 12,841 women were counseled on PPFP of whom 2830 (22%) received PPFP methods. Among women who chose the PPFP, 1322 (46.7%) chose to receive PPIUD of which 461 (35%) insertions happened during the immediate post-partum period, 357 (27%) for post placenta IUD insertion and 504 (38%) of insertions during cesarean delivery. The number of women with PPIUD insertion was 598, at the start of the intervention (between 2010 and 2013), decreased in 2014-2016 (104 women) and rose to 620 women between 2017 and March 2018. Among women who received IUD, counseling during ANC was 418(31.6%), during latent labor 347 (26.2%) and 557 (42.1%) in immediate postpartum period. Following the insertion, about 756 (57%) of PPIUD recipient attended the first follow-up visit in 4-6 weeks, whereas 449 (40%) attended the second visit at 3 months. Among those who attended the follow-up visits. Looking at complications among women attending follow-up, 15 women requested for IUDs removal, seven clients reported hemorrhage, four complained about pelvic pain, 11 women developed genital infection whereas four reported disapproval with their spouses. Only 22 women reported spontaneous expulsions and 20 of them accepted the reinsertion.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>The experience of introducing PPFP counseling and PPIUD services into routine care can be expanded from one facility to another, especially among those with high volume deliveries. Connecting antenatal visits with labor and delivery wards through effective counseling and quality PPIUD services is essential to increase acceptance and uptake. It is important to strengthen PPFP counseling from antenatal care (ANC) through delivery and postpartum follow-up consultation to address misconception about the PPIUD, assist women to make an informed choice and therefore increase PPIUD acceptance and uptake. While the results on PPIUD services are promising, strategies (eg; phone calls) should be used to encourage women to attend the follow-up visits.</p><p>Addressing gaps in training of providers and in equipment/supplies for PPIUD services is paramount to increase postpartum FP. On-site training, mentorship of trained health providers and follow up through structured supportive supervision visits were essential to improve the skills of providers, identify gaps and strengthen the PPFP/PPIUD service delivery into routine care. However, the sustainability of the PPFP/ PPIUD program requires retention, motivation and ownership of trained providers, availability and accessibility of FP commodities  to increase the method choice including  PPIUD. Additionally, Effective record keeping, documentation and analysis of routinely collected in facility are utmost to monitor progress of the program, and enhance the continuation of care. Coordination between services and strong leadership at the hospital are imperative for quality PPFP service delivery.</p><p></p><p></p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Births that are too early or too soon increase risk of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. At the same time, adolescence is a time of rapid sexual and reproductive health (SRH) transition: 24% of Ethiopian women have had sexual debut before age 15 and, by age 18, a full 62% have. Despite high knowledge of modern methods to delay and space pregnancy (97.5% among 15-19 year olds), use is limited—just 31.4% of young married women 15-19 use a modern method. In general, unmet need for contraception is highest among rural women. Given the illegality of early marriage, young married girls in rural Ethiopia constitute a particularly hard-to-reach and underserved population. Just 12.9% of current non-users 15-19 discussed family planning when last seen by a fieldworker, and 3.9% did when seen at a facility. To support the Federal Ministry of Health in finding new solutions to respond to this challenging adolescent SRH landscape,  Population Services International (PSI), funded by the Gates and Children’s Investment Fund Foundations, implements Adolescents 360 (A360). Aiming to increase modern contraceptive demand and access among married adolescent girls 15-19, A360 partners Ethiopian youth with experts to research and co-design interventions by and for young married couples.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>During A360’s formative assessment and successive iterative intervention design phases, the project sought to gain deep understanding of the experiences, perceptions, and desires of rural youth, the factors influencing them, and how they inform and shape their SRH lives.  We asked: 1) What are the  cultural understandings of puberty, sexual debut, marriage, contraceptive use, sexuality, childbearing, and maturity and adulthood that influence the contraceptive motivations, emotional experiences, cognition, and behaviors of adolescent girls? and 2) What are adolescent girls’ SRH life trajectories and related contextual meanings, beginning with puberty, and moving into sexual activity, childbearing, marriage, and fertility?</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>We conducted a qualitative formative assessment through  August- December 2016 in three kebeles of Afar, Oromia, and Tigray regions. Kebeles were  selected based on presence of a local partner, proximity (60 to 80 km) from a main town, and security to conduct the assessment. Health Extension Workers and local partners recruited participants using combined convenience and snowball sampling. Respondent inclusion criteria was:   local residence, aged 15-19; parents or parents-in-law of an adolescent 15-19; responsible for health service delivery to 15-19 year olds in the area. We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 65 married adolescent girls, 61 parents of adolescent girls, 36 adolescent boys, 11 husbands of adolescent girls, and 17 health care providers, until reaching saturation of themes. Additional focus group discussions with 27 community gatekeepers were conducted. All interviews were conducted in respondents’ local language, and were documented through detailed field and observational notes. These were analysed through youth-expert partners, organized into insights, and applied to co-design solutions that were in turn vetted by a transdisciplinary team of A360 experts in socio-cultural anthropology, adolescent developmental science, public health, social marketing, and youth engagement. Research ethical  approval  was obtained from the Ethiopia Public Health Institute’s Scientific Research Ethics Committee.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Four dominant themes emerged from the analysis.</p><p>1) Ascribed values of child-bearing:  Building on existing literature, findings reaffirm the intense pressure married girls experience to prove fertility and secure social status. Parents are a primary influencer over timing and frequency of girls’ childbearing. Girls desire to conform to parents’ expectations, view motherhood as an attainable means of joy, and also desire support for their own health. Interventions that introduce new ways for married girls to garner parental approval, social status, and joy <em>as</em> they pursue healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy are best poised to respond to married girls’ felt needs.</p><p>2) Uncertainty about changing times: parents grapple with safeguarding their daughters amidst changing socio-economic and cultural contexts. Interventions that position contraception as a tool to help in this may mitigate parental resistance.</p><p>3) In it together: Young married female and male respondents express desire for joint decision-making in contraceptive use, yet in reality disparities in SRH knowledge and agency pose a barrier. Interventions that create opportunities for couples to learn about contraception and jointly plan for their future are well positioned to respond to their immediate needs.</p><p>4) Changing aspirations: Young couples’ parity aspirations are lowering as their aspirations for financial quality of life rise. However for most young couples, their parents and/or providers only introduce them to contraceptives after having had at least one child.  Interventions that ensure contraceptive counseling and service provision early in couples’ SRH lives together are well-timed.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>Existing global literature supports community-based service delivery and interpersonal counseling regarding healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy to promote improved reproductive health outcomes among young married women and couples. The A360 formative assessment findings provide additional insights to this established body of knowledge, helping to understand the felt experience and contrasting desires and beliefs of young couples as they seek to conform to existing social norms and expectations of their community, while also responding to the changing social and socioeconomic landscapes in which they live. In the case of A360, these findings have supported design of the Smart Start intervention, which serves as a targeted package of communication messages and outreach techniques for married adolescent girls and couples in rural Ethiopia. Building on the need to create learning moments for adolescent girls and male partners regarding healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy, Smart Start provides guidance for local health worker cadres to reach young couples, foster their exploration and joint decision making regarding future goals, and contextualize reproductive decision-making within those goals. Further, the intervention enables parents and community to support girls despite their limited confidence to engage directly in SRH education, by providing them with an entry point to accepting contraception, and the reassurance that family planning is a way for young couples to safeguard their future.</p>",

      "title": "Family Planning at Schools: a good strategy to reach out to younger cohorts",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The promotion of family planning (FP) activities at schools by the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA) Mozambique country office (CO) is a good practice for addressing a crucial FP challenge in the country: reaching out to the younger cohorts of the population. The national population survey in 2015 (IMASIDA), showed that although Mozambique experienced an impressive overall FP uptake (modern contraceptive prevalence rates (CPR) increased from 11% in 2011 to 25% in 2015); progress was slower for the 15-19 age group (CPR of 14%). Other indicators showed similar trends: demand satisfied for family planning grew from 28% in 2011 to 50% in 2015 (Track20 2017) yet the unmet needs for FP remained very high (26% in 2017) among girls and young women aged 15-24 years old. The challenge remained in reaching the youth with relevant information and services.</p><p>Given this scenario, the Government of Mozambique took up the challenge and accentuated efforts to redress this gap, in particular through the provision of FP at schools.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>This program builds upon an existing program providing SRH information at secondary schools by expanding and adding the provision of FP. Outreach brigades visit schools on a monthly basis, at minimum. It is the Maternal and Child Health nurses who provide FP information and contraceptives as well as other interventions such as HIV counselling and vaccinations. They refer and encourage the students visit health facilities for further assistance. The Ministry of Health (MoH) is leading the program in collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MoE), with support from UNFPA.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>The program started in 2016. The target group is adolescents and youth (girls and boys) aged 15-24 years old at secondary schools in all the provinces of the country; teachers and staff may also benefit from the services in place. In the first year of the program (2016), it provided FP services (information, counselling and contraception) to 264 secondary schools out of the total 650 in the country; increasing to 298 in 2017. This represented a coverage of 41% and 46% of secondary schools in 2016 and 2017 respectively. </p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Results from 2016 and 2017 are very positive:</p><ul>\t<li>About 95% of adolescents and young women of reproductive age in the targeted schools were reached through this program in 2017 (The 298 schools covered 226,572 girls 15 years and older).</li>\t<li>This intervention contributed in 2017 to 214,451 new users of FP, which represents 8% of the total new users in Mozambique. This is a positive increase from 2016 (national contribution of 6% of new FP users).</li>\t<li>Results will also show the preferences for FP methods across provinces and in particular the use of implants for long-term protection.</li></ul><p>The high number of adolescents that initiated contraceptive use in secondary schools in 2016 and 2017 indicates that this is an effective strategy to ensure the uptake of FP within this age group, to contribute to the overall CPR target, and to reduce the adolescent fertility rate. By reaching the 650 secondary schools by 2020 (as committed by the government), the program will contribute to 15% of the total FP new users in Mozambique. Besides, having these services at schools normalizes the use of contraception in the socio-cultural context so that generations to follow will have positive attitudes towards contraception.</p><p>One of the challenges faced by the program is the acceptance of parents, school personnel and other community based adult gatekeepers of young people who may not personally agree with FP at schools. To address this issue, the program conducts informative sessions with school councils (involving parents, school personnel and students).</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>Mozambique is among the few countries in Africa providing contraceptives in schools. Experience in Mozambique has shown that schools are effective places for FP dissemination strategies targeting adolescents and youth. In addition, this intervention complements existing comprehensive sexual education provided at the schools. It is a good example of being ‘youth friendly’ regarding time and place of services. As result, the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (RMNCAH) Investment Case finalized in April 2017, incorporated this strategy as a core component. Furthermore, at the FP Summit in London (July 2017), Mozambique committed to provide FP services (information and contraceptives) in all secondary schools by 2020 for the first time. These are direct implications of the program. Thanks to this successful intervention and rollout/snowball impacts, Mozambique has taken up the challenge of FP policies targeting the youth, signaling that the sexual and reproductive health and rights of adolescents are at the top of the political agenda.</p><p>There is no doubt that schools represent a unique opportunity to develop attitudes and behaviors that are conducive to healthy SRHR and provide easy access to quality contraceptive methods to the youth. Thinking further ahead, the low rates of female attendance of secondary school in Mozambique, particularly among the most marginalized and economically deprived, place a ceiling on the extent that this program can reach the full target group. Thus, it is advisable to continue with it while in parallel putting in place other programs to reach those that cannot be reached at schools.</p>",

      "title": "Improving family planning in hospitals: a Philippines case study",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>The Philippines Department of Health (DOH) National Family Planning Policy stipulates that all public health facilities in a service delivery network (strategic mechanism for expanding access to and strengthening continuum of care for families across political and geographical boundaries) should provide the full range of family planning services. This is a key issue in the Philippines, where the 2017 National Demographic and Health Survey estimates that 17% of married and 49% of unmarried sexually active women have an unmet need for family planning.  Further, there is great regional disparity in births delivered in a health facility (28%-92%). These data indicate a need for scale-up of family planning education and service delivery interventions.</p><p>The USAID’s LuzonHealth Project, implemented by RTI International, operates in 21 provinces and cities across eight regions supporting 52 hospitals in Luzon, Philippines. In 2016, 21% of the DOH and 79% of the local government unit (LGU) hospitals within the LuzonHealth catchment area did not provide the recommended range of family planning services. Furthermore, systematic processes were not in place for recording and reporting in many of these hospitals and there was a lack of purposive, focused, demand generation activities for women seeking prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>USAID’s LuzonHealth Project designed three workshops that were implemented in four regional clusters; (1) establish or enhance family planning programs in hospitals, (2) strengthen family planning in hospital recording and reporting systems, and (3) increase demand generation for family planning in hospitals.</p><p>To assess the relevance of these workshops for promoting and standardizing family planning services in public hospitals, LuzonHealth evaluated the progress in these key areas in 2017.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>To ensure quality monitoring and tracking of the status of implementation of the action plans at the 52 hospitals, LuzonHealth developed a tracking tool that assesses the major elements of family planning services in hospitals. The tracking tool was used by LuzonHealth staff and regional and provincial health office partners when conducting monthly monitoring, enabling the team to track improvements in family planning service capacities of hospitals.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Four months after implementation, 89% of LuzonHealth-assisted hospitals had an appointed family planning focal person; 49% had organized core teams; and 51% had capacity to provide the full range of family planning services. As of June 2017, 100% of LuzonHealth-assisted hospitals had an appointed family planning focal person, 79% had organized core teams, and 69% had capacity to provide the full range of family planning services. During this same time frame; the number of LuzonHealth-assisted hospitals that conducted family planning orientations to nurses assigned in the wards increased from 32% to 87%, referred postpartum women to the family planning clinic prior to discharge increased from 45% to 58%, and conducted referrals within the facility increased from 43% to 69%.</p><p>Of hospitals that participated in workshops, 90% are using an updated family planning registry, 98% are using family planning form I, and 90% are using an updated Family Planning Client Record. The use of these tools streamlines family planning program implementation and helps to improve quality of care.</p><p>Fifty-two percent of clients who received information during family planning classes in hospital wards or outpatient department underwent one-on-one family planning counseling. Of those who were counseled, 63% accepted a new family planning method of their choice.</p><p>In response to the success of these interventions, DOH regional offices have implemented similar initiatives in 65 additional hospitals outside of LuzonHealth-specific project sites. Per the request from the regional health offices, the initiative has also been expanded to 15 additional hospitals within LuzonHealth’s project sites.</p>",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>This initiative of strategically improving family planning in hospitals has demonstrated the importance of establishing and institutionalizing family planning programs rather than simply installing family planning services. To ensure sustainability of these programs, management support and buy-in are essential and should be prioritized and established prior to implementing the initiative.</p><p>Compliance with the different recording and reporting forms ensures that proper recording and reporting contribute to the overall performance of family planning in hospitals. While these recording and reporting tools and guidelines generally have been accepted in the LuzonHealth Project sites, and even in non-Project sites in Luzon, more importantly these have been approved and adopted by DOH for implementation nationwide.</p><p>Further efforts should be carried out to establish adequate performance and accountability standards, develop a budgeted annual work plan to sustain and expand services, and establish quantifiable performance standards for family planning services. The performance standards should focus on access, coverage, choice, safety, and financial viability.</p><p>On a broader level, policy should ideally be formulated aimed at creation and composition of family planning management teams in hospitals. There should be clear definitions and parameters outlining the management teams’ roles and responsibilities, including establishment of standard operating procedures for current and future hospital personnel to ensure sustainability of family planning programs in hospitals.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Health care service providers must be equipped with the correct knowledge and skills in order to provide effective family planning services. Despite the Ministry of Health and other partners conducting Long Acting and Reversible Contraceptives (LARC) trainings for health workers, provision of regular access to contraceptives remained low in most Facilities in Kisumu County. Classroom-based trainings were effective for knowledge transfer but limited in skills transfer due to inadequate case load in the compressed time. High cost, disruption of health services at the Facilities during the classroom training period were identified as key challenges for access to services. Majority of facilities were understaffed and this affected the selection of appropriate participants for training. Frequent internal rotations and transfers of Service Providers contributed to inadequate skilled personnel in the family planning department. In 2013, Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP) conducted assessment of 32 Public Health Facilities in Kisumu County to determine readiness to offer LARC. The assessment found that only 25% of the Facilities could offer LARC services effectively, and this contributed to low uptake of FP services and skewed method mix in these facilities.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>On-site clinical mentorship is a sustainable learning process through which a trained and experienced healthcare provider guides another healthcare provider (mentee) in a specific skill. Learning is tailored to the mentees needs and convenience. MCSP initiated clinical mentorship on LARC to improve knowledge and skills of Providers to create regular access to FP services. Mentors were selected from the health facilities and Sub Counties based on FP proficiency. Selected Mentors were trained on mentorship skills. A mentorship log book developed by the Division of Reproductive Health and partners was utilized by both mentee and mentor to monitor the learning and</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>30 Public facilities in Kisumu County were selected for mentorship. 20 Mentors were selected from the supported facilities and were updated on training and mentorship skills during a 3-day central training workshop. Interested mentees were identified in the 30 Facilities and mentors were tasked to conduct mentorship. The mentorship followed the guidance provided by the Division of Reproductive Health of the Ministry of Health that sets the minimum criteria that mentees had to attain before being eligible for certification. Scheduling of mentorship sessions was done through local arrangement between the Mentees and the Mentors taking into account facility workload, availability of Mentors and client load. Mentorship utilized FP outreach activities as opportunities for Mentee competence.</p><p>Quarterly technical assistance visits and program supervisions were conducted in all mentorship sites to support Mentors and Mentees as well as evaluate progress during the 12-month period. Training data was obtained from MCSP monitoring and evaluation data. FP service statistics were reviewed for the intervention year and compared to the previous year.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>Almost 1 in 5 women across Madagascar report unmet family planning needs: levels are highest in rural areas (INSTAT, 2009). Isolated communities living in the island’s priority biodiversity conservation areas often lack access to family planning and health services. Their ability to engage in sustainable natural resource management and livelihood diversification is restricted by poor health and unmet family planning needs. </p><p>PHE is a holistic approach to sustainable development: so-called because of the way that it reflects the connections between people, their health and the environment. Family planning and other health services are combined with community-based natural resource management and biodiversity conservation efforts through cross-sector partnerships between health and environmental organisations. These partnerships leverage the operational infrastructure of environmental organisations in order to facilitate and/or strengthen health service delivery in remote areas. Health messages are incorporated into existing environmental community outreach activities in order to support and/or generate demand for services.</p><p>Madagascar's national PHE network, established in mid 2014, brings together around 40 health and environmental organisations (listed here) to develop cross-sector partnerships: integrating their complementary activities in biodiverse and under-served areas throughout the country. This model is proving highly effective in addressing the unmet family planning needs of some of the world’s geographically hardest-to-reach communities.</p>",
      "programInterventionActivityTested": "<p>The intervention is a national network which promotes the integration of family planning and other health services with community-based natural resource management and biodiversity conservation efforts by: </p><ul>\t<li>\t<p>Fostering connections and building technical capacity for cross-sector partnerships among health and environmental organisations,</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Documenting and disseminating high impact practices, </p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Collating and communicating quantitative and qualitative results, and</p>\t</li>\t<li>\t<p>Engaging with policy makers and funders to create an supportive institutional environment for further uptake.</p>\t</li></ul><p>The network mobilises health and environment actors to identify and implement win-win PHE partnerships in the zones where they already work, thereby addressing unmet family planning needs in under-served areas.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>PHE network activities (coordination meetings, training workshops, learning exchanges, tailored mentoring, etc) are evaluated through feedback from PHE network members and review of the uptake of PHE partnerships. A quality charter allows PHE network members to assess and assure the quality of their PHE partnerships. The PHE network collects basic data on all PHE partnerships active across Madagascar: names of villages served / engaged, total number of people in these zones, types of health services delivered and natural resource management initiatives supported, number and types of contraceptives distributed - used to calculate number of couple years of protection provided and estimated number of unintended pregnancies averted (using Marie Stopes International’s Impact tool) - as well as community member testimonies and lessons learned. These data are collated and visualised through an online knowledge management system. PHE partnerships are typically located in isolated, biodiverse, under-served, rural areas where local communities are highly dependent on natural resources and report unmet family planning needs. They may be managing marine or terrestrial ecosystems with support from environmental organisations while gaining access to health services through mobile providers and/or community health workers. Family planning services benefit women of reproductive age and their partners - often with a</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>The PHE network is proving to be a low-cost yet effective mechanism for supporting uptake of PHE partnerships in Madagascar. In turn these PHE partnerships are addressing the unmet family planning needs of previously under-served communities living in geographically hard-to-reach areas of high biodiversity by increasing access to health services and/or strengthening existing health service delivery. </p><p>When the PHE network was created in mid 2014, there were just 3 active PHE partnerships reaching around 40,000 people. By the end of 2017, there were 12 active PHE partnerships reaching more than 185,000 people, with a further 20 PHE partnerships in development. </p><p>The number of couple years of protection (CYPs) provided in PHE partnership zones across Madagascar has also increased significantly since the PHE network was created in July 2014: from just over 800 CYPs in the last two quarters of 2014 to just over 9,200 CYPs in 2017.</p>Community testimonies and high impact practices are currently being collated, and will be ready to share at the ICFP. Themes include climate change resilience, youth leadership, increasing gender equality in natural resource management and increasing male engagement in family planning.",
      "programImplicationsLessonsLearned": "<p>These experiences and preliminary results from Madagascar demonstrate that a national learning network bringing together actors from different sectors can be an effective mechanism for supporting the development of win-win PHE partnerships that address the unmet family planning needs of under-served and geographically hard-to-reach communities. These partnerships combine the already funded and complementary activities of health and environmental organisations. As such they can be implemented rapidly and at scale in order to advance progress towards FP2020 goals. Mobilising non-health actors in support of reproductive rights and increased access to family planning has proven non-controversial in Madagascar. Environmental organisations recognise the value of integrating health promotion into their programming as a way of responding to community priorities and strengthening local engagement in biodiversity conservation efforts. Health organisations embrace the opportunity to reach geographically isolated communities that might otherwise be considered too difficult or costly to serve. We suggest that other countries could apply this national learning network model to support uptake of high impact practices in pursuit of the FP2020 goals. A notable lesson learned is the value of maintaining a focus on growth and exchange at the implementation level: the Madagascar PHE Network started by building a strong foundation of active PHE partnerships through an intensive series of coordination meetings, training workshops, tailored mentoring, etc. targeting health and environmental organisations and has just recently started to engage more at the policy level - drawing on concrete results from the PHE partnerships to communicate the contribution of this approach to government</p>",

      "title": "Sustainability of Family Planning Projects Implemented by NGOs in Public Sector of Pakistan: A Case Study of Projects Implemented during 2012-16",
      "significanceBackground": "<p>Public sector in Pakistan is striving to address maternal and child health needs, thereby having an effect on adoption of Family Planning by increasing demand, access and availability of information and services1]. Nevertheless, very few indicators related to FP have shown improvement during the last decade. According to Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (2012-13), unmet need is at 20 percent, and only 26 percent women are using modern contraception in Pakistan2]. About 37 percent of contraceptive use episodes discontinued within 12 months for any reason while amongst the non-users, forty-four percent of currently married women have no intention to use contraception. The NGOs have become complement stakeholders of donors, are being conferred huge funds with the goal to help in FP issues. Though the contribution made by NGOs to improve RH/FP indicators in Pakistan, cannot be ignored yet funding to NGOs is increasingly being criticized for not realizing real impact in terms of sustainability. Hence, an important area of query is to study sustainability of projects executed by NGOs3.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>The study intends particularly to understand if projects being implemented are sustainable through studying the individual as well as combined effect of different lifecycle phases of project which have been implemented in public sector by NGOs. The hypotheses are as follows:</p><ul>\t<li>Most of the RH/FP projects implemented by NGOs in public sector lack sustainability after they have completed their life.</li>\t<li>Thorough implementation of each element in every project phase ensures the sustainability of projects implemented by NGOs</li>\t<li>Every project phase is equally pronounced and important in ensuring sustainability of project results.</li></ul>",
      "methodology": "<p>The study uses primary data availed through specifically designed survey in April 2017. It includes individuals (Project Director/ Manager/Officer) from 23 NGOs who exclusively worked on FP projects completed during last five years and handed over to Government Departments of Health and Population Welfare in Pakistan. To lower the biasness in measuring sustainability, an objective criterion is adopted to gauge sustainability from Khang and Moe (2008) 4 as well as checklist developed by Arscott-Mills, Foreman, and Graham in 20125. The theoretical base of this method is Logical Framework Analysis (LFA) which assess the project throughout the process and divides it into components of input, activities, output, outcome and impact. Accordingly it, impact is a long term phenomena and to get the desired impact of any project after the success of project, it is necessary for the project to be sustainable. The independent factors include mechanisms to ensure resources, integrate sustainability objectives, capacity analysis, framework and plan development, commitment from stakeholders, ownership, routine analysis and data use, sustainable financing or activities, disseminate lessons, plan exit strategy, implement exit plans, resources for post project studies and integrate results into plan. The dependent factor is project sustainability.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>Majority of the respondents are from NGOs, yet 32 percent from GONGOs and 12 percent from INGOs. In view of projects tied, 39 percent respondents are working in organizations which launch projects in community with donor support as per their own assessments and priorities. Government is not consulted in designing and execution of project. This is closely followed by organizations which are approached by government for help in areas of priorities. About 18 percent are themselves both donor and implementer hence launch their projects on their own. Only 7 percent respondents are working in those organizations which approach government to help them in government’s priority areas. The study reveals that though respondents have high perception regarding each factor yet are more pessimistic about its presence in the projects implemented. According to individual perception of the respondents, among all routine analysis and data usage during implementation phase is very important, however, regression results show that and ensuring finances during implementation phase and for post project studies are critical for ensuring sustainability of project. Moreover, sustainability of designing phase is most important for smoothly enabling implementation phase. In this backdrop, for improving the project sustainability, the NGOs should advocate participatory approach for involving public sector in the design, planning, implementing, monitoring as well as evaluating projects.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>The sustainability of projects implemented by NGOs has remained least attended and the most underreported form of research in Pakistan and dire need is to investigate this important aspect. Hence, this study addresses an important area of query of projects implemented by NGOs as funding to NGOs in Pakistan is increasingly being criticized for not realizing real impact in terms of sustainability on the target beneficiaries of FP initiatives. In other words, the question of if NGO assistance is working for sustainable development in Pakistan, needed to be responded, and hence enduring the pursuit for answer. Moreover, an investigation of sustainability of NGO funded projects carries immense importance because no particular study has been conducted for a detailed consideration of the existing problems and areas where Pakistan needs to focus and gaps that need to be addressed to ensure sustainability of gains made.</p><p>The present study contributes not only to understand the recent trends and level of sustainability of projects implemented by NGOs but also highlights loopholes and ways to address it at different phases of projects. This in turn will strengthen the evidence base to help national and provincial governments formulate more effective strategies to tackle the issue by signifying policy/strategy changes as well as designing and introducing the sustainable interventions. The research highlights critical issues related to projects implemented by NGOs and will undoubtedly enable a fresh development view towards the projects implemented by NGOs in Pakistan.</p>",

      "significanceBackground": "<p>The World Health Organization has released guidance over time on the types of services to be included in comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care, including for HIV-positive women. Evaluating progress towards achieving universal access to SRH services requires an understanding of individuals’ needs and the financial affordability of accessing care.</p><p>In South Africa, healthcare services are currently offered through two parallel systems: public and private. In the public sector, which serves 80% of the population, primary healthcare services and termination of pregnancy services are offered freely to individuals who do not have private health insurance; services are also free for all pregnant and lactating women and children under age 6. In contrast, the private health system is financed through payments from individuals or privately purchased health insurance, and users often pay co-pays. Due to equity concerns, plans are underway to merge the two systems in the near future. A barrier to planning is a lack of data on potential costs incurred by users currently and in the future.</p>",
      "mainQuestionHypothesis": "<p>In this study, we aimed to contribute to health systems planning by exploring women’s SRH access patterns and the costs associated with access in Johannesburg, South Africa. Our comprehensive definition of SRH needs included care for: fertility problems, menstrual problems, menopause symptoms, sexually transmitted infections (STI), experiences of intimate-partner violence (IPV), contraception, and breast and cervical cancer screening. We contextualized women’s SRH costs based on estimates of household income.</p>",
      "methodology": "<p>In 2015-2016, we conducted an observational study at three public facilities: an HIV treatment facility and two primary healthcare facilities. Trained interviewers used systematic random sampling to identify eligible women (i.e. aged 18-49, attending the clinic to obtain services for themselves, and willing to discuss HIV).</p><p>We used Stata for analysis. First, we assessed women’s SRH needs over the past 12 months. For contraception, need was defined as being sexually active in the past year, not currently pregnant, not sterilized (woman or her partner), not wanting a child in the next 24 months, and not post-menopausal. For breast and cervical cancer, need was based on national policies for screening. For all other SRH issues, we allowed women to self-report their needs.</p><p>Total costs (USD 2016) for meeting SRH needs included: out-of-pocket spending, lost income, and the value of time spent travelling/waiting. We valued women’s time using average annual income for women in South Africa. For women who accessed SRH services, we estimated costs per SRH need and total annual costs. Because some women had unmet SRH needs, we also estimated the costs of meeting all SRH needs in a hypothetical year, using per service cost estimates.</p>",
      "resultsKeyFindings": "<p>We enrolled 385 women. They were predominately Black (87.5%), married (25.7%) or cohabitating (54.6%), and living in a house (42.9%). The median age was 36.7 (IQR: 29.7-41.9). Over half the sample (56.4%) was employed at least part time. However, the majority (64.9%) reported that their primary source of income in the last 12 months was a transfer from a family member, spouse, or partner.</p><p>During the prior 12 months, 94.8%% had at least one SRH need, including eligibility for cervical or breast cancer screening. Contraception (45.7%) and care for menstrual problems (39.2%) were most common.</p><p>Roughly 80% of women who experienced fertility problems, needed contraception, or had STI symptoms sought care for their need. In contrast, less than half of women who needed care related to menstrual problems, menopause symptoms, or experiences of IPV sought care. Most women sought care in public facilities.</p><p>In the previous year, 79.7% of all women incurred costs for at least one SRH need. The average total costs incurred for seeking care for an SRH problem ranged from $10.14 for contraception to $186.62 for fertility problems. Women reportedly spent an average of $35.54 per year seeking SRH care. However, if they had sought care for all of their SRH needs, the cost would have been $52.65 per woman, or 1.1% of annual household income. Costs were the same for HIV-positive and –negative/status unknown women; though, women over age 35 spent more annually. Few women received any financial assistance for meeting their SRH needs.</p>",
      "knowledgeContribution": "<p>SRH needs persist throughout women’s reproductive lifespans. Yet, the costs incurred by women for accessing SRH care, excluding maternity and delivery care, are often overlooked. In this study, the estimated average annual cost to women of meeting all their SRH needs did not exceed a crude (but widely used) measure of catastrophic spending (i.e. greater than 10% of household income). However, many of the participants were unemployed and depending on transfers from family and friends as their primary source of monthly income. Further, because SRH costs are likely to persist year-on-year and because so few women seem to receive help in paying for these costs, over the course of a woman’s life, the total costs could become substantial.</p><p>Many women in our study did not obtain care for their SRH needs in the past year. This may reflect a lack of awareness regarding their needs or structural barriers to accessing care, but likely also reflects financial barriers faced by some women.</p><p>Although offered freely to most people, accessing health services in South Africa’s public sector is not without cost. As South Africa and other countries grapple with plans for increasing access to SRH services, especially under the rubric of universal access, it is important to remember that individuals incur costs despite free care at the point of service. Policies that address geographic proximity and service quality would be important for reducing costs and ensuring full access to services.</p>",
